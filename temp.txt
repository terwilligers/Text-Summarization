 This is where Kenken gets its similarity to Sudoku. If you have a four square by four square grid, every single horizontal row must have a 1, 2, 3, and a 4 in it. The numbers, of course, can be in any order. This is true for each row.   If your grid is a six by six, you would have the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, without any repeating. If it is a 9x9, then 1-9, etc.; , A completed Kenken needs to have every single number in every single row and column, only once. Note, however, that this doesn't just mean you fill in every single box with your numbers and win -- each puzzle still requires a specific order -- as dictated by "cages."  , Inside of the Kenken, there are big, thick lines marking of several boxes at once, with a mathematical equation (ex. "3+," "1-," "2"). These are called cages, and they provide the puzzle and the solution. Make a note of them, making sure you understand what boxes they cover.   Cages can be straight, composed of either a single block or many at once, or L-shaped. Just follow the big, thick lines. Before beginning, make sure you can tell the edges of the each cage to prevent mistakes. Every box will be in a cage of some sort., If you have four numbers in a cage labeled "8+," then the four numbers in that cage must add up to eight, like 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 (note that this would be an L-shaped cage, otherwise you'd have two 2s in the same line!). So a cage with two boxes labeled "3-" would have to have two numbers that, when subtracted, equal 3, like 4 and 1. Every cage will have a goal -- and this is how you solve Ken Ken.   Kenken only contains addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (ร), and division (รท).Cages with only one box and no mathematical symbol ("4") mean you just place the number in the box on its own. If the box just says "4," just put a 4 in the box.  If you have a box that asks for "2รท," you can answer it with either "4 | 2" or "2 | 4." You just need the two correct numbers in the equation -- the order doesn't matter., These rules all still apply no matter if you're playing a 4x4 or a 9x9. While the difficulty of the puzzle increases depending on the size, the actual rules and strategy for solving it do not.   If you're a beginner, start with 4x4 boards to get used to the system and strategy. Some papers even offer 3x3 grids for beginners too.
