 If your curse is successful, it could significantly affect your target’s life — possibly even leading to death. Note, however, that many people do not believe in magic or the efficacy of curses, and there is little scientific evidence to suggest they work.   Studies have shown that people who believe they're cursed and feel helpless against it may suffer from diastolic flaccidity, which causes a rapid drop in blood pressure and can lead to death.; , It is a popular belief amongst witches that curses are unethical and, as a result, will return to the curser in the same form they have been given.If you curse someone, be prepared for bad luck to visit you as well.   A common Wiccan concept also abides by this reap-what-you-sow mentality: it says that whatever you do, whether it be positive or negative, will come back to you threefold.There is little known about the psychological impact the person placing the curse may suffer when they are successful in hurting their target. If you place a curse on someone, you might suffer psychological stresses that you can’t even imagine at this point., Think about why you want to take revenge, and if it’s really worth your time and energy to do so. Chances are, your time and energy are better spent moving your life forward instead of dwelling on negative emotions that will only make you feel worse.   When you take time out of your life to seek vengeance instead of moving on, you’re wasting valuable moments in which you could be bettering your life. The person who hurt you might very well deserve to have something bad happen to them, but they certainly don’t deserve to take up any more of your time. Studies have shown that getting revenge can actually make us feel worse. Experts believe this might be because taking vengeance can make the event seem bigger than it actually was, whereas the failure to take vengeance can make the event seem more trivial in the long run., If you decide that you want to move forward with the curse, sit down and carefully think about what you want to happen. Having a clear sense of what you want to happen as you work through every stage of your curse will make it more effective.  Before putting a curse on anyone, make sure that you’ve protected yourself with a protection spell and/or amulet. If the person you’re cursing also practises magic, it’s possible that your curse will bounce back to you., A large, wide pickle jar is excellent, but any other glass jar of a similar size will suffice.  A poppet is commonly understood as a doll that bears a resemblance to the target of the curse. In fact, it can be anything that symbolizes your target, including a photograph, some of his/her hair, or even a piece of paper with his/her name on it.   If you collect hair or nail clippings from your target, be sure that you do this without being noticed — preferably by taking them from a trash receptacle — otherwise, you could risk getting into trouble not only with your target but the authorities. If you use a photograph of your target, write their name on it legibly in red or blank ink. Also use red or blank ink for writing your target’s name on a piece of paper. If you choose to write your target’s name down and include it in the jar, use the name that they identify with as opposed to their full name. For example, if you target’s full name is Jonathan Smith, but he goes by John Smith, use “John Smith”. You can even use someone’s online username if that’s how you know them.  The word has many definitions, but in this case, “medium” refers to the substance through which you’ll transmit your bad energy (i.e. your curse). Any of the following items will serve as strong mediums:   Rusty nails, thumb tacks, or other sharp items can be added to the jar to generally hurt your target.Red pepper flakes or whole red pepper pods will cause your target to become angry.Vinegar may be used to sour the life of an individual, or to sour the relationship between two people.Rose thorns may be used to cause your target harm through deception (as a beautiful rose looks deceptively soft until it pricks your finger) or to sour love.A match can be added to jars containing paper to fire up your curse whenever you shake or move the jar.Poisonous plants may be added to the jar to cause harm to your target. Just be sure to wear protective gear (e.g. gloves, goggles, face mask) whenever you’re handling anything poisonous. Urine (your own) may be added to the jar to help you gain domination over your target. Avoid using urine and blood that are not your own, as these are biohazards and could cause you to become ill. Graveyard soil can be used to drive someone away or drive two people apart. Soil from a fresh grave is the most potent, but taking it may be considered defilement by authorities.  If you do decide to remove soil from a new grave, ask permission from the departed’s soul and leave an offering — alcohol (e.g., wine poured into the ground), food (e.g., part of your last meal), or money (even a dollar) are standard.   Note that you needn’t use all of these items in your jar. One or two of them is fine!  , Do this with hot, soapy water, being sure to remove the label and any residual adhesive. To avoid streaks or debris moving from the drying cloth to the jar, you can let the jar air dry.  As you add things to your curse jar, stay focused on your target and what you want to happen to them.  If you are using a doll and have the victim's hair, you may choose to wind it around the neck of the doll.  Remember to focus on your intentions as you do this. If you do not have any specific desires, just think about how angry you are and what the target did to you to deserve your ire.  Before sealing the jar, make sure that there is nothing else you want to add to it. After it’s closed, you should not reopen it as, at the very least, it will lose its power.  If you have a black or red candle, you may choose to light it and drip the wax all over the edge of the lid to ensure a fully air-tight seal.   To make it extra powerful, you can use a pin or other sharp point to carve your target’s name into the candle before melting it.  Do this while continuing to think angry thoughts about your target. Remember, you are infusing the jar with negative energy and power.   If you are using nails or thumb tacks, be sure to shake the jar gently to avoid breaking it.  You can hide the jar at your own home, but hiding it somewhere close to your target will be even more effective. If you do hide it close to your target, hide it extra well so that it will not be found.   As an example, you might bury the jar in your target’s yard. If you do this, make sure that no one sees you and that it’s deep enough that no one can find it. Hide your jar well but make sure that it will be easy for you to retrieve if you need to. You never know, you might change your mind and want to break the curse at some point. Another reason to hide the jar well is that if someone finds it and breaks it, the evil intentions of your curse might come back to you., Your curse could take days or even months to take effect. If a lot of time goes by and you think it hasn’t worked, it’s also possible that your target is protected by a protection spell or amulet.If your target is protected by magic, consider whether it’s worth your efforts to continue pursuing your curse, as it could take considerable time and energy to get past their defences. It’s also possible that your curse affected someone close to your target instead of your target him/herself. Before deciding that your curse didn’t work, consider whether this may be the case., If you lack the time, resources, or interest in doing the curse jar, you can also use psychology to make your target believe they are cursed.   Simply scaring your target with words or evil glares, or doing things to sabotage their everyday life, will yield the desired results. Again it must be said, however, that your energy is better spent focusing on improving your own situation, rather than on making someone else’s life harder. The saying, “living well is the best revenge,” applies here.  The more convinced your target is that they are cursed, the more effective your curse will be.In addition to using the jar, get in your target’s head by letting them catch you staring at them evilly or by saying unsettling things to them.   If you’re not confident that you can say anything truly frightening to your target, stick to the evil stare. It’s important that they realize you have it in for them and that they’re worried about it.  If your target is someone who physically bullies you, you might want to avoid speaking to and/or staring at them, as this could compromise your own safety.    Popular things to say regard general body functions, including, but not limited to, sleeping (“You’ll never have a restful sleep again”) and touch (“You will destroy everything you touch”)., When verbally cursing your target to their face, be general. That way, your target is more likely to see your curse as being fulfilled when something that remotely fits the description happens.   For example, if you say “You will destroy everything you touch” and then a few days later the person drops a glass or even just stumbles while tying their shoe, your curse might pop into their head. From there, as your target’s anxiety grows, the curse will become stronger. Your target will fulfill your curse for you, and all you did was put the thought into their head., Studies have shown that people who are over-supervised tend to perform more poorly than those who are left alone. It will take time and dedication to pull this one off, as you’ll need to constantly bother him/her.   You don’t even have to be mean to your target. You can literally just give them advice and ask what they’re doing all the time, and this will be enough to ruin their focus and make them perform more poorly at whatever they’re doing.This doesn't have to be done in person. Regular Facebook messages and emails are fine, too. Using all the channels available to you to offer your target continuous encouragement and advice will trip them up in no time., If you break the curse without protecting yourself, it might come back to you. Before breaking the jar (and as a result, the curse), make sure that you are protected with a protection spell, amulet, or at the very least, an incantation., If you have hidden the jar somewhere outside of your own property, take care to ensure that no one sees you retrieving it — especially not the target of your curse.  The easiest way to do this safely is to place it in a paper shopping bag, fold the bag closed loosely, and then break the jar gently with a hammer.   If you've placed fluids inside the jar put the jar in a paper bag and then a plastic bag before breaking it.  Once the jar is broken, seal the paper bag in a heavy plastic bag before placing it in the trash. Be sure to clean up any fluids or bits of glass that may have fallen out of the bag as you smashed the jar.  

be aware of the possible outcomes.  know that it could come back to you.  consider forgiving and moving on.  set your intention.  protect yourself.  obtain a glass jar.  obtain a poppet.  collect objects to use as mediums.  clean the jar thoroughly.  remind yourself of your intention.  place the poppet into the jar.  add the medium to the jar on top of the poppet.  seal the jar tightly.  seal the lid with wax (optional).  shake the jar.  hide the jar in a dark place.  be patient.  skip the curse jar (optional).  scare your target.  use your discretion.  use the “nocebo” effect.studies have shown that taking placebos can help people think themselves better.you can harness this knowledge to achieve negative results, too.  keep it general.  check in with your target often.  protect yourself.  remove the jar from its hiding place.  smash the jar.  discard it. 

 Your first piece needs to be 3½ inches (8.89 centimeters) long, and your second piece needs to be 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) long. You can use a solid colored ribbon for this, but a pattern (such as polka dot) would look nicer. This will make the wings.Grosgrain ribbon is different from satin ribbon. It is not shiny and it has a bumpy/ribbed texture.; , Fold both wing ribbons in half, widthwise. Match up the ends, then cut them at an angle. Unfold the ribbons when you are done.  The ribbon only needs to be between 1½ and 2 inches (2.54 and 5.08 centimeters) long. Use a solid color for this. This will make the body.         Choose a color that goes well with your wider ribbon. For example, if you are using a pink ribbon with white polka dots for the wings, choose a white ribbon for the body.  This will make the antenna. Use the same color as your body ribbon.  This is not completely necessary, but it is highly recommended. Not only will this make your butterfly look neater, but it will keep the ribbons from fraying. Light a candle or turn on a lighter. Hold each cut end of the ribbons over the flame for a few seconds until the ends melt slightly.         Do not let the ribbons burn, however. Keep a bowl or cup of water nearby, just in case.  Fold a wing ribbon in half widthwise. Pinch the fold to make a crease, then unfold the ribbon. Thread your needle and tie a knot at the end. Sew a simple running stitch along the crease          Work on one wing ribbon at a time.  This will help create the wing shapes for your butterfly. Do not cut the thread yet.  Keep the wing ribbon gathered with one hand, and use your other hand to wrap the thread around it a few times. Pull the needle under the wrapped thread, then push it back through the loop. Make a second similar knot, then snip off the excess thread.  Find the center of your second wing ribbon. Make a running stitch down the center, widthwise. Pull the thread to gather it. Wrap the thread around the wing a few times. Knot the thread to itself, then snip off the excess., Place the wings side by side, with the long edges touching. Place the longer wing on top and the shorter wing on the bottom. Make sure that the cut angles are sloping inward towards the joint to create > and < shapes.Make sure that the patterned side is facing you.  Thread your needle and tie a knot at the end. Push the needle up through the center of the bottom ribbon and out through the top ribbon. Wrap the thread around the center of both ribbons a few times. Tie the thread off, then sniff the excess.          For a neater finish, flip the butterfly over, then make two small stitches to either side of the center thread, joining the wings together., Set the body ribbon down on your work surface. Orient it vertically. Flip your butterfly over so that the back is facing you. Set it down on top of the body ribbon. Make it centered.  Pull the bottom of the body ribbon up and press it into the glue. Cut off the excess ribbon. Place another drop of glue on the back of the butterfly. Pull the top part of the body ribbon down and press it into the glue. Snip off the excess ribbon.  Fold the antenna in half to make a V-shape. Place it on the back of the butterfly, with the ends sticking out over the top of the longer ribbon. Secure the antenna with a few stitches or with a drop of hot glue.  Draw a horizontal line across the back of the butterfly, using the joint between the wings as a guide. Press the butterfly against the hairclip. If you wish to attach the butterfly to a hair tie, do the following:          Cut a small circle out of felt, about the same size as the butterfly's center. Cover the circle with hot glue. Place the circle against the inside of a hair tie. Make sure that the hair tie is centered across it. Press the butterfly into the glue. Orient it horizontally.  

cut two pieces of ⅞-inch (22-millimeter) grosgrain ribbon.  cut the wing ribbon at an angle.  cut a short piece of ⅜-inch (9-millimeter) grosgrain ribbon.  cut a 2½ (6.35-centimeter) piece of ⅛-inch (3-millimeter) ribbon.  heat seal the ribbons for a cleaner finish.  sew a running stitch down the center of a wing ribbon, widthwise.  pull the thread to gather the ribbon.  wrap the thread around the center of the wing ribbon, then tie it in a knot.  stitch, gather, and knot your second wing.  position the wings.  stitch the wings together.  place the body ribbon behind the center of your butterfly.  wrap the body ribbon around the butterfly.place a drop of hot glue on the back of the butterfly.  fold the antenna ribbon in half and attach it to the back of the butterfly.  hot glue the butterfly to a hairclip.hot glue a narrow, matching ribbon over the top of a hairclip and snip off the excess. 

 Be cautious that you don't get it on your hands. It will make it harder for you to do anything with oily/slippery fingers.; , Make sure that the entire thing is a mushy substance. Then form it into a bowl-shaped model but keep the center hollow.  The more food coloring you use, the longer the "stain" will last.  Make sure that the food color doesn't spray everywhere.  Be careful that you don't stain your hands.   Leave tube uncapped for 12-16 hours. This is to help it firm up again for easier use.  Dab 3 circles on the bottom and 2 on the top. Rub with Q-tip or ring finger. Then apply another layer. If it is too sticky, dab it with a napkin or tissue gently. 

empty out the lip balm or chapstick onto the small plate using a toothpick.  mash the chapstick into a glob.  add 2-6 drops of food coloring.  mix with toothpick gently and slowly.  put into the chapstick tube or a new container, bit by bit.  apply to lips.  finished.  

 Selective mutism often appears in kids by the age of five, but likely goes undiagnosed in many cases. People often assume that a child with SM is just really shy, or perhaps that he or she is deliberately not speaking as a ploy to get attention or “make a scene.” Don’t be fooled, though — selective mutism is very real and is not under the control of the person with the condition.SM is an anxiety disorder, so yelling at or punishing a child will almost certainly backfire by causing even more anxiety. Don’t ignore the condition by saying “oh, she’s just quiet,” or have a huge celebration any time a person with SM speaks up in a social situation. Treat it as a real and manageable condition. SM won’t just “go away” if you ignore it. In fact, it may get worse as a child grows up. So don’t delay in seeking a diagnosis and treatment.; , Building a healthy, close relationship with a child (or adult) with SM is one of the first steps toward overcoming the condition. The more comfortable and confident the person is in speaking with you about thoughts or feelings, the more capable he or she will be to manage the anxiety that comes with interacting with strangers or larger groups.Spend time with the individual. Promote conversation by asking questions (“What are you building with those blocks?” “What do those clouds look like to you?” “If you could go anywhere in the world, where would it be?”). Build up trust and comfort (a “safe space”) so that the person is completely comfortable in expressing his or her feelings.  Everyone with SM experiences the condition differently. Some do fine in a school classroom but can’t speak in front of a single stranger. Some can speak in front of the same group of people in one setting but not in another. Additionally, other sources of anxiety might exacerbate the condition, and calming influences might moderate it. Identifying these “triggers” can help significantly with treatment.Especially if your loved one with SM is an older child or adult, you may be able to identify anxiety triggers (job stress, relationship troubles, money issues, etc.) that exacerbate the condition. Helping the person to manage these stressors may help to manage SM as well.  

don’t ignore, deny, or minimize the condition.  create a “safe space” for expression.  identify what makes the condition worse and better. 

 If you’re looking for fall daycare options, start looking in the summer before spots fill up at more affordable care centers. If you have just learned that you’re expecting, begin budgeting, educating yourself about personal finances, and reducing your other household expenses immediately. You’ll find that the more time you give yourself to plan and save, more affordable care options will be available.Look online for nearby daycare centers. Start asking for recommendations from any friends or acquaintances you have who are also parents. Look for additional child care options, such as babysitters or nannies. For each option and recommendation you find, call ahead to ask about cost and when the program anticipates filling up spots. That way, you'll have a better idea of your timeline and of how much you'll have to pay for care.; , Discuss more flexible hours or telecommuting a few days a week to reduce the cost of daycare. Ask if a salary raise is negotiable so you can better afford care. Whether you’ve just found out you’re expecting or have to shift your schedule around your toddler, you should ask your HR department for help.Say something like, "I'm expecting a child, and more flexible hours would really enhance my productivity and help me balance my responsibilities. Is telecommuting two or three days a week to reduce the cost of daycare possible?" Mention something like, "It's been over six months since my last pay raise, and a salary increase would help me better afford daycare for my child. I believe I've demonstrated my worth to the company, and would truly love to continue to balance my home life with my work responsibilities." Try to include mutually beneficial solutions like, "If I'm working from home more, it'll help save the company's resources, like wi-fi, office space, and supplies." Ask HR if the company has in-house child care options or a reduced-cost deal with a nearby child care center. If they don’t have either, suggest that they set up an arrangement with a nearby center, since it will save their employees money without costing the company anything.  Look for a local YMCA, JCC, or other nonprofit organization that offers child care services. These organizations don’t have to answer to shareholders or generate profit, so they cost much less than private businesses.If you attend religious services, ask your religious organization's staff for suggestions. Search online for a YMCA, and use keywords like "YMCA childcare." Look for a contact number, and ask if they can provide you with reviews from families currently enrolled who can describe their experience. Ask around your network of fellow parents to see if they have any experience with local nonprofit childcare centers. When you call, ask if the center is licensed by state or local government, or what regulations they must meet in order to maintain their practice. Avoid centers that can't describe their standards or won't provide testimonials from parents currently using their services.  You can also search for a local family-run daycare to cut costs. Just make sure whatever program you research is state licensed or otherwise regulated by your local government.Ask if they're accredited with the National Association for Family Child Care (NAFCC). Verify their accreditation using the NAFCC website: http://www.nafcc.org/. Ask any potential family-run daycare options for testimonials from current clients and professional references. Ask about the caregiver's qualifications. Ideally, go with someone with at least two years of college, at least five years experience in early childhood development, and CPR and emergency training. These factors aren't required by every state, but should nonetheless be included in your personal criteria., While daycare is typically the most affordable child care option, you might find a nanny more affordable in some circumstances. For example, your work hours might be incompatible with a daycare’s set hours, and you might have friends or coworkers who also have children around the same age as yours.You can approach your friends or coworkers and ask them if they’d be interested in sharing the cost of a nanny. If it’s affordable, cost-sharing a nanny offers a low caregiver-to-child ratio that studies show will benefit your child later in life., Ask a family member or trusted friend to watch your child once or twice a week. Ask them if they're willing to babysit for free, or for less than you'd pay at a daycare center. Reducing the number of days per week you'll need to pay for daycare will help make it more affordable.  

start looking for child care options early.  talk to your company’s human resources department.  look for local nonprofit child care options.  try to find a family-run daycare.  explore the possibility of getting a nanny.  ask family members to watch your child.

 You may want to put two boxes after each item, one for before camp, and one for after camp. The following list might be of help to you:   Toothbrush, toothbrush case, toothpaste, mouthwash, floss Hairbrush/comb Deodorant Shampoo and conditioner (2-in-one is a useful product) Hand sanitizer (if you think you need it; camps often supply it. Also, soap does the job too and doesn't contribute to antibiotic resistance) Feminine items if needed, e.g. pads, panty liners, tampons Hair accessories, e.g., hairbands/headbands/bobby pins/clips/hair flowers, etc. Face cleaner/wash Chapstick, makeup, lotion, perfume, razor, shaving cream (Note: These are all things you can live without while on camp) Mirror, nail file, Q-tips, cotton balls Band-Aids, insect repellent, sunscreen, after-sun lotion, Timer (?); , Just remember to bring only things that you use in your daily life. You don't need that moroccan oil that you've used about 4 times in your life, for example. Go through your daily toiletry routine and write down all the things you use on a daily basis. This can keep things organized and help you not forget or overpack.  Preferably use one that is not transparent.   Choose a bag that has pockets. This makes it easier to organize your toiletries and find them with ease. Depending upon how many pockets your bag, you might want to divide the items. For example, hygiene, hair, mouth. That kind of thing. The bag shouldn't be too big, but don't bring a tiny one that you can only fit your toothbrush in. If you don't have one, then most stores like Target or Walmart sell them, or you could probably even get one from your local dollar store  

make a list of all the toiletries you think you'll need.  add anything else you think you need and subtract things that aren't relevant to you.  find a bag. 

 While all programmable thermostats have roughly the same functions, they aren’t universally operated in the same manner. If you have the manual for your thermostat, keep it handy in case it has a unique set of operations.  Track when you leave the house (or workplace) and are away regularly for at least 4 hours. Make notes about your schedule for 7 days, including all 24 hours each day.  The current time and date must be entered into your programmable thermostat for it to function properly. Nearly all thermostats have a button that reads “set” or possibly even “day/time”Press this button and a clock will appear on the display for you to set the time and the date. Use the up and down arrows to set the items and press the same “set” or “day/time” button again after each step to proceed to the next.   Prompts will indicate whether to enter the time as a twelve-hour increment or as a twenty-four-hour figure. You may also need to set the day of the week, but it will follow in the same process after the time and date., Once you have the date and time programmed, you are ready to program the thermostat’s schedule. Some brands will have an actual “program” button, whereas others may require you to scroll past the time and date information by hitting the “set” button several times.You will reach a screen on the display where it prompts you to set a “wake” time for weekday mornings.You may actually want to set the time very slightly before you wake up so that the system is already running.   Most thermostats will allow you to schedule weekdays and weekends separately, whereas some may allow you to schedule each day separately. Again, you can use the up and down arrows to cycle through the time.  With the “wake” time set, you will now have to set the “wake” temperature. Press the respective button for your model thermostat again and the temperature will begin blinking. Use the up and down arrows to find the temperature you want.Some models may allow you to set a temperature range so that you don’t have to reprogram the thermostat with each season. For example, it may prompt you to set both a wake summer and winter temperature. This will ensure that the system heats when the ambient temperature is below a certain threshold and cools when above another threshold., With the “wake” time and temperature set, the thermostat will prompt you to schedule the time you leave for the day during the week. Most people set these temperatures much higher during the summer or lower during the winter to conserve energy and run the system less while no one is home. Use the same process of hitting the “set” or “program” button and the up and down hours to cycle through and find the settings you want.   If you don’t want the system to run at all while you’re away, you can simply set it to turn on at a temperature that you know your home won’t reach.  The next time and temperature setting the thermostat will request is for what time you return home during the week. As with the “wake” setting, you may want to set the time fifteen-to-thirty minutes before you get home if you want to ensure that the home has already reached the temperature when you arrive.  The fourth and final weekday setting the thermostat will request is for the time you go to sleep at night.Since many people might open windows during summer nights or pile on extra blankets during the winter, you can save money and energy by respectively raising or lowering the overnight temperature setting.   Wherever you set this temperature will hold over until the “wake” time and temperature you have set for the following morning.  Once you finish setting the weekday schedule, the thermostat will prompt you to set the same four times—wake, leave, return, and sleep—for the weekend. As with the other settings, keep using the “set” or “program” button in order to advance the menu and keep using the arrows to adjust the times and temperatures.  Depending on your thermostat model, once you hit “set” or “program” on the final weekend “sleep” settings, it may return you to the current day, time, and temperature and begin following the schedule. Other models may have a “run” button that you must press to initiate the schedule. 

read the manual.  determine your schedule.  program time and date information.  press the “set” or “program” button.  press “set” or “program” again to set a temperature.  set the “leave” time and temperature.  set the “return” time and temperature.  set the “sleep” time and temperature.  repeat the process for the weekend.  press the “run” button to initiate.

 Avoid products that contain alcohol, because it will strip your hair of natural oils and dry it out. Apply coconut oil to your hair, from root to tip, once or twice a week and let it sit on the hair for 10 to 15 minutes., Blow dryers, curling irons, straightening tools and sunlight can all cause dryness and breakage, which lead to weak hair. Apply a heat protector product and use an open backed brush to reduce dryness and damage., Most grocery stores offer options like Mane n’ Tail that are designed to moisturize and grow hair. Try them for a month or two to see if they work for your hair.  If your hair breakage is significant, this can help reduce friction as you toss and turn. It will protect your locks, and it is also a great way to lock in a deep conditioning treatment., Use coconut oil or a combination of coconut oil and mashed avocado to add moisture to your hair and help it grow stronger.

 The longer the hair of your Maltese, the more time you will spend on grooming. A puppy cut is the shortest cut and requires the least amount of maintenance. Long and medium length hair is more prone to knots and tangles.         Puppy cuts are also best if your dog has a more cottony texture as opposed to a silky texture. Use dog clippers or scissors to cut the hair. If you do not want to cut your dog's hair yourself, take it to a professional groomer for a cut. The frequency of hair cutting will depend on how fast your dog's hair grows.  Tear stain removers are specially formulated cleansers that will remove the stains from white fur. Always read the instructions on the bottle before using. Typically, you will wet the area, apply the stain remover using a wet cloth, and then rinse the area with clean water.          The most popular brands of tear stain removers include Angle Eyes, Eye Envy, Betta Bridges, and Tropiclean.The frequency of use may vary depending on if you are treating existing stains or preventing stains. You can always ask your veterinarian to recommend a product for you to use.  Some Maltese will stain more than others. If you are concerned about your dog's tear staining, see a veterinarian to make sure that everything is fine.There may be other reasons that your dog is having a big problem with tear staining. Once you know the cause of the tear staining, you can use the right solution.   Excessive tear production, blocked tear ducts, other eye diseases, diet, and ear infections can cause your dog to have more tear stains.If your Maltese is a teething puppy, you may also notice more tear stains.  Maltese have a lot of hair around their ears. Excessive amounts of hair can cause ear problems for your dog. Sprinkle some ear powder on the ear canal and all of the ear hair. Hold the ear flap up with one hand, and use your fingers to pluck hair out of the ear canal.The ear powder will keep your dog from feeling pain when you pluck. If you are not comfortable doing this, take your dog to a professional groomer. Ear powder can be purchased from your local pet store.  Your dog may not be to fond of grooming at first. However, you need to get your dog used to the grooming process. Get all of your supplies together before you start a grooming session. This will make the session as short and efficient as possible.If your dog does not like being touched in a certain spot, touch the spot for a few seconds to help your dog get used to it. Reward your dog when it is well behaved during grooming. You can also start with short grooming sessions and build your way up to longer sessions.  

get a haircut that fits with your lifestyle.  use a tear stain remover.  consult a veterinarian.  trim the hair around the ears.  groom your dog at regular intervals. 

 Aside from some salts, most iron compounds tend to be in the iron (III) state. This includes things like railroad ties, nails, steel wool, paperclips, etc. Choose your source based on the amount of iron you need, how fast you need it, and what is available to you. For example, steel wool is cheap and oxidizes quickly, but railroad ties contain a larger mass of iron., You want to be sure that you have enough water in the container to cover the iron piece at all times. Keep in mind that the process of electrolysis may heat the water. This can increase the rate at which the water evaporates., You will need to use a battery or other direct current power source to power the reaction. The power source should have a lead connected to the negative side and a lead to the positive side. Choose the size of your power source based on how much rust you are trying to create and how fast you want it. Larger power supplies will generally create rust faster., The leads should not touch each other. Instead, they should be submerged in opposite sides of your water tank. This will make the water solution part of the circuit and force electricity to flow through the water., While iron will typically rust under atmospheric conditions without any help, submerging it in water increases the rate of oxidation. Submerging iron in water that is being electrolyzed will increase the rate of oxidation even more since the electrolysis produces hydrogen gas (H2) and diatomic oxygen (O2). Diatomic oxygen is a great oxidizer and readily reacts with the iron to form rust., Now that your tank is setup, you can turn on the power. This will start the current flowing through the solution and oxidizing the metal. Be careful not to touch the leads, or touch them together. Also, do not put your hands in the water unless you turn the power off.   If you are using a power source without a switch (like a battery), either put the leads in last, or do not hook the leads to the battery until you are ready for power.  While the reaction is relatively fast compared to natural oxidation, it isn’t instant. You will need to leave the reaction for several hours at least to yield rust. You will probably need to leave it for a day or two to get a decent amount., When your rust forms, it will be in the tank of water. The first step to getting it in a dry and usable form is to filter out some of the water. You can stretch cheesecloth or some other fabric over a jar or sink and pour the solution through. Allow it to sit for an hour or so to drain as much water as possible., To finish drying your rust, you will need to bake it. Set your oven at 400 °F (204 °C) and bake the rust for one to three hours. Be sure to use an old pan, the rust will stain it. 

obtain a source of iron.  fill a container with water.  find a power source.  submerge the positive and negative leads.  submerge your iron source.  turn on the power.  allow to sit.  filter the solution.  dry the resulting rust. 

 If you are using pillar candles, use both short and tall ones. This will make your mantle look more interesting. Also, try to use a color that contrasts with the mantle, or the wall behind it. For example, if you have a dark-colored mantle, use white or ivory candles. If you have a white mantle, use pink candles for a softer look, or red candles for a romantic look.   Red, pink, and white/ivory are typical Valentine's day colors. You can also use gold or silver.  If you can't find any red or pink candles, but don't want to use plain white candles, you can always dress up what you have. Wrap some twine or thick lace around the middle of a candle, and secure it with a piece of clear tape or a drop of glue. Stick a heart-shaped button or sticker in the middle.You can also wrap strips of double-sided tape around a candle, and then roll the candle around in glitter. Use Valentine's day colors, such as pink, red, gold, or silver. You can match the glitter to the candle color, or use a contrasting color, such as gold glitter on a red candle.  This is great for those who have plain candles and don't feel like decorating them. It can turn a plain set of candles into Valentine's day ones with little effort. Place your pillar candles on the base first. Next, scatter some conversation hearts or glass marbles across the base, between the candles.   Use Valentine's day colors for the glass marbles, such as red, pink, silver, and gold.  Fill a shallow, glass bowl with water, and add some floating candles. For some more color, scatter some red or pink glass marbles across the bottom of the bowl. You can use ordinary white floating candles or rose-shaped ones (in red, pink, white, gold, or silver).   For a twist on the floating candle, consider using a tall, cylindrical vase or a mason jar instead of a glass bowl. Fill the vase or jar almost to the top with water, and add the candle.  You can also use other vase fillers as well, such as conversation hearts or glass marbles in pink, red, or clear. Try to use a contrasting color for the candle, so if you are using pink filler, use a white candle. For a finishing touch, wrap some pink or red ribbon around the middle of the vase, and tie it in a bow.To use less filler: place a small can inside the vase, and stick the candle on top. Fill the space around the can with filler, all the way up to the top of the can. When you are done, the can should not be visible.  

put candles on tables and fireplace mantles.  add to existing pillar candles.  decorate the trays, chargers, and stands you put pillar candles on.  use floating candles for a more romantic look.  fill a cylindrical or hurricane vase with pink and/or white sand and stick a pillar candle on top. 

 If you are not already in a class studying mythology, you can try taking one at the nearest university or community college. Greek mythology is a popular course, and many colleges offer it in both the spring and fall semesters, as well as over the summer. Courses typically cost from $100 at community colleges to over $1000 at universities. In the U.S., senior citizens can often take classes for free at community colleges.  If you cannot make it to a university to class, you can take a course online instead. Many universities offer online courses, while you can also find them offered by for profit companies or even for free.    University courses – Universities such as Oxford, Duke, Brown, Harvard, and Yale offer online courses on Greek myths and heroes. Some of these, such as Harvard Professor Nagy’s course “Concepts of the Hero in Greek Civilization” are offered for free. Nagy’s course is available at http://kleos.chs.harvard.edu/?p=220.  Paid Online Courses – The most well-known series of for-profit courses online are offered by The Great Courses at www.thegreatcourses.com.  Free Online Courses – There are a variety of sites that bring together free mythology courses from across the web, including www.mooc-list.com (for courses from the Massive Open Online Course project) and oedb.org (Open Education Database).

 Use a regular 12 pt. font, such as Times New Roman or Sans Serif. Leave plenty of white space, use bold headlines and increase the size of your font for your name and section headings.   If you are applying for an art or graphic design job, then take extra time to format your resume in a creative way. It does not have to be a list, so work with the space that you are given.  This is usually a short prose section at the top that is an "elevator pitch" to the agency. Include your years of experience, major accomplishments, promotions and managerial skills.  Whether you are using a chronological or functional format, you will need to list your skills and successes using short, specific sentences. Each sentence should begin with an action verb.   If you are applying for a creative advertising position, consider using action verbs like authored, composed, directed, conceived, conceptualized, developed, edited, designed, created, planned, launched, originated, established, produced and presented. If you are applying for a managerial or accounts position, consider using action verbs like augmented, proposed, increased, initiated, excelled, led, revitalized, consulted, resolved, developed, implemented, generated, promoted, improved, negotiated, sold and produced.  Examples of these words include click through rate, display ads, cost per click, cross promotion, real-time bidding, rill rate and rich media ads. Review advertising annuals, advertising blogs or notes from advertising classes if you are unsure whether you are using enough advertising terminology.  Ad agencies will be looking for people with experience in the industries they often work with.  If you went to an advertising school or a school with a good alumni network, this may help you to form a bond with potential employers. Make this a short section.  Internships with major agencies where you have relevant experience can work to your advantage; however, serving or retail experience will not help you get a job if you are applying for a creative position. It may be easier to parlay retail or business jobs into relevant experience if you are apply for an account management or planning position with an agency.  If you write an advertising blog, include it here and say how long you've done it. If you volunteer advertising time for a charity, write a few details about this experience.  Showing that you are a member of the American Advertising Federation, the American Marketing Association, the Society for Marketing Professional Services or a similar state wide association will show a dedication and interest in being part of the professional community. If you do not already belong to an association, you should consider joining.  

format your resume in a professional way.  write a "qualifications", or "executive summary" section.  describe your experience and accomplishments using action verbs.  insert advertising buzzwords, or keywords, throughout your list of accomplishments.  include the types of industries you have worked for, such as automotive, insurance, cosmetics, food/beverage and more.  include a short education section at the bottom.  include internships or jobs, either chronologically or functionally, if you don't have very much professional experience.  place a "hobbies/interests" section at the bottom of your resume, if it adds to your qualifications.  include any professional advertising organization of which you are a member.

 Developmental child care emphasizes all areas of a child's development, including physical, cognitive, social, emotional. This is the most common form of child care philosophy currently practiced in the United States. In a developmental child care classroom, you may expect to find a combination of hands-on activities, child-directed and teacher-led activities.Developmental child care is interactive, and has an informal sense. Learning through play is considered the central focus of the curriculum in a developmental child care program. The role of the teacher is to provide security, stimulation, support, limits, and affection.  This child-centered philosophy follows the child's interest and social curiosity. Experiential learning is prioritized over teacher-led learning.Progressive preschools are sometimes termed "Bank Street Approach" due to their initial development at the Bank Street College of Education. The teacher's role is to facilitate the child's interests and intellectual curiosity.  Montessori philosophies were developed by Dr. Maria Montessori in her study of child development. These methods emphasize the individual child's initiative and independence. Children move through different activities, called "work", at their own rate of speed. The self-correcting tasks teach the child directly, while observing other children completing a task allows children to learn from each other.Montessori methods use "manipulatives" or small sensory items that the children use to complete a task. Colored blocks, for example, might be manipulatives matched to pictures of colored blocks in an activity. Montessori classrooms typically contain a range of ages, because each child is encouraged to learn at her own pace. Some parents choose Montessori methods because they feel it encourages their children to develop leadership skills.  This child care philosophy uses a combination of developmental and Montessori approaches. It emphasizes creativity and artistic expression, but also collaboration. Reggio-Emilio learning employs group projects based in child-directed curiosity.For example, if a child expresses interest in why a plant grows, a Reggio-Emilio response might be, "Let's learn more about that!" From this child-led curiosity, a collaborative interactive project including study of soil, plants, water, and sunlight might result. Reggio-Emilio is named after the area of Italy in which this pedagogical approach first developed. One of the goals of Reggio-Emilio is to use collaborative learning to help a child become a better citizen.  The Waldorf approach, developed by Rudolf Steiner, is a play-based approach. It's characterized by regular, structured routines. Certain days of the week, for instance, will always include the same activities. Creative activities, such as art, music, dance, singing and acting, are emphasized.The programs are well-known for their refusal to incorporate any media, such as reading, computers, videos or electronics into their curriculum. There are no grades in a Waldorf program. There are no hand-outs, homework, or tests. The Waldorf approach emphasized the holistic nature of the child: body, spirit, and soul.  Parent-cooperative programs, known as co-ops,are formed by parents to offer a shared setting for their children. These programs are created by parents who desire a strong influence in their children's daily activities. The teachers, director and and helpers of the classes are chosen by the parents, and are parents of children in the program.Cooperative learning tends to prioritize values of cooperation and resolving conflicts. One of the ways in which cooperative learning emphasizes education is that your child sees your participation in the classroom. This allows the child to know that education is a priority for you, and encourages the message that learning is important.

 The nuts (or kernels) are usually situated in pairs within the pods. Pods are usually lightly colored, long and have vein-like structures running across them. Each peanut plant will carry about 25-50 kernels in all.; , This is one indication that the peanut pods are ready for harvesting. Another indication is that the veins in the pod change to a darker color.   Pods closest to the plant tend to ripen earlier than pods further away.  Peanut pods grow into and upward from the ground. If the soil is wet, it will be harder to remove and there is an increased risk of rot and mold growth. The mold growth is often toxic to human beings.  

look for seed pods.  wait until the leaves turn yellow.  harvest only when the soil is dry. 

 It would be senseless to travel all the way to New York City just to see a taping that you might not even be able to see. Plan a vacation!; , Go to and check if they are taping on the day of your travel. They do not tape shows every week.  Find the "NBC Studios" marquee at 7 a.m. the morning of the taping. Lines fill up fast, so don't be surprised if you show up at 5 am and there is already a line.  This is your only shot.   If you're lucky, you might get to see one of your favorite shows in person!  , Include the names and ages of everybody traveling, and anything else. You may attend the 8 p.m. dress rehearsal or to 11:29 live taping. You cannot choose the dates of your taping unless you get stand-by tickets!  , And wait some more. Wait until you get that confirmation email. You'll be notified 4-6 weeks in advance before your taping. Remember-- this could be at any time!  , You can go from family extravaganza to a quick weekend getaway. If you're not to crazy about taking missing work or school, fly Friday night and fly back Sunday morning. You should have enough time to squeeze in something fun on Saturday.  You need to be at 30 Rockefeller Plaza by 8 am to pick up your tickets, so show up or you're giving up your seat to some stranger. 

plan a trip.  check the dates.  show up at 30 rockefeller plaza.  ask personnel where and when you can get stand-by tickets to saturday night live.  next august (and august only), email snltickets(at)nbcuni.com.  wait.  get a flight, get a hotel.  get there.  enjoy!  

 This would help you decide upon how many beds that you would need. This is the first thing to consider and must be right the first time. This will help you to narrow your choices.; , Why? There is more storage space and there is less hassle of assembling and reassembling dining and kitchen areas; you have the area dedicated to these purposes. For example, if two people are traveling in a four berth motor home, you can have your sleeping quarters and dining area permanently made up and you won't have to break it down when needed. Plus, you get extra storage area. This is especially important the longer you rent the vehicle.  Possibilities include toilet, heating, shower, kitchen, storage, batteries or power and gas heating. Check to see if these facilities require outside power sources or if they are self contained within the vehicle. E.g, some vehicles require additional power to operate additional appliances, or you may want to save your generator/battery by using an outside power source.  Understand that fresh water and waste water tanks can mean frequent refilling and emptying of cassettes and tanks. Waste should generally should be emptied 2 to 3 days or this can cause some unwanted odors to linger in your motor home.  Consider the width restrictions on the area you would be visiting to make sure that it would not be too wide on the roads you will be driving on. Consider the flexibility and the maneuverability and dimensions, especially with high tops.  Prior research of parks and roads is essential, especially when traveling with a larger motor home.  You might decide to rent an older vehicle rather than a brand new one. Prices are also determined by the amenities you choose. One warning, you do get what you pay for, what may seem to be a bargain at first could turn into a nightmare when you rent the vehicle. If going for a budge vehicle, ensure that the vehicle is well maintain and the company offers 24 hour roadside assistance., You pay for spontaneity. Check what the off season rates are and book then - these will vary per country. Booking prior to holidays (e.g school holidays, public holidays like the 4th of July) can save you money., Each company has unique policies that vary for various circumstances. Questions to ask when reviewing the terms: What happens if I get into an accident? What happens if the vehicle breaks down? What happens if return the vehicle earlier or later? What happens if my vehicle gets broken into? 

figure out just how many people will be traveling with you.  always consider the next berth up when renting a motor home.  decide on just how many facilities you would need and how self sufficient you would expect to be.  think about how long a trip you will be taking and how long you will be actually traveling as opposed to how much time you might be spending at a campsite.  understand that some areas and roads have restrictions when it comes to sizes and widths.  check camping ground and holiday parks to see if they can facilitate the size of your vehicle beforehand.  make sure you rent accordingly to your budget.  booking well in advance often ensures a lower rate.  an absolute must: check the terms and conditions thoroughly.

 Here's what you'll need to make vegetarian stuffed peppers:  6 large red peppers 2 cups cooked brown rice 3 chopped small tomatoes 1 cup thawed frozen corn 1 chopped small sweet onion 1/3 cup drained canned red beans 1/3 cup drained canned black beans 3/4 cup cubed Monterey Jack cheese 1 can (4.25 oz.) chopped ripe olives 4 sliced basil leaves 3 minced garlic cloves 1 tsp. salt 1/2 tsp. pepper 3/4 cup meatless spaghetti sauce 1/2 cup water 4 tbsp. grated Parmesan cheese  , Set these peppers aside., Combine 3 chopped small tomatoes, 1 cup thawed frozen corn, 1 chopped small sweet onion, and 1/3 cup drained canned red beans in a bowl and toss the ingredients to combine them., After you've tossed the previous ingredients, stir in 3/4 cup of cubed Monterey Jack cheese, 1 can (4.25 oz.) of chopped ripe olives, 4 sliced basil leaves, 3 minced garlic cloves, 1 tsp. of salt, and 1/2 tsp. of pepper. Toss the ingredients to combine them.,,, slow cooker.,,, Cook the stuffed peppers until the peppers are tender and the filling is completely heated., of grated Parmesan cheese., Serve these vegetarian stuffed peppers immediately. 

gather your ingredients.  cut the tops of 6 large red peppers and remove the seeds.  combine the rice, tomatoes, corn, onion, and beans in a large bowl.  stir in the cheese, olives, basil, garlic, salt, and pepper.put the stuffing into the empty peppers.combine 3/4 cup of meatless spaghetti sauce and 1/2 cup water.pour half of the mixture into an oval 5-qt.place the stuffed peppers into the slow cooker.top the peppers with the remaining spaghetti sauce.  cover and cook on low for 3.5 - 4 hours.sprinkle the peppers with 4 tbsp.  serve. 

 Add 1 cup of bentonite clay, and 1 cup of arrowroot powder in a medium sized bowl.Use a spoon to mix the ingredients together until they are fully combined.  Once the powdered ingredients are mixed, add in 5-10 drops of an essential oil of your choice. Mix the ingredients again to combine the essential oil with the powdered ingredients. The more drops of essential oil you add, the stronger smelling your dry shampoo will be.   This step isn’t mandatory for making a dry shampoo, but it lends a nice fragrance to your homemade product. Peppermint, lavender, and chamomile are popular choices for essential oil additions to dry shampoos.  Use a funnel to add the dry shampoo into your chosen dry shampoo container. A container that resembles a salt or pepper shaker works best for storing your dry shampoo. However, make sure if you use a salt or pepper shaker, that it is either unused or thoroughly cleaned with soap and water. #*Make sure the container is completely dried before you add in your dry shampoo.   The tiny holes in the cap of a salt or pepper shaker allow for added control when you sprinkle the dry shampoo onto the roots of your hair.  Tightly fasten on the top of the container, and enjoy your homemade dry shampoo. Be sure to look for any possible gaps between the container and its top, so you don't spill your dry shampoo when you're shaking it over your head.  

mix the dry ingredients of the dry shampoo.  add essential oil.  add the dry shampoo to a small container.  attach the top of the container. 

 If you are comfortable and secure in your basic payments and necessities, but find it difficult to budget or save money to pay off your debts with the "debt avalanche" method, the "debt snowball" method may be right for you. This method focuses on you paying off your smallest debts first to simply reduce the number of different debts you owe.It should be noted that this is not the fastest or most efficient way to reduce your debt load.  Organize your paperwork and determine how much you owe on each debt. Create a schedule of which debts you will pay off first by placing the debt with the smallest amount owed first and going up in amount owed from there. Be sure to note minimum payments for each debt and pay those each month before directing any money towards paying off your first debt. You don't want to incur more debt by not paying these minimums.  Use any additional money you have each month to begin paying off the first debt. You may consider creating a budget for yourself to save money or perhaps taking on a part-time job. However you come up with the money, save as much as you can and put it all towards that first debt. When you've paid it off, celebrate! You've earned it.  After you've paid off the first debt, move on to the next debt on your list. This one will take longer to pay off than the first, but keep yourself motivated to continue paying off debts by remembering the load that paying the first debt took off your shoulders.  Your number of debts, and total debt overall, will decrease faster and faster as you continue to pay them off. Eventually, you will be completely debt-free!  

determine if this method is right for you.  organize your debts by amount owed.  pay off the first debt.  move on to the second debt.  continue paying off debts until you are debt-free. 

 To grow mold on bread you will need to collect the following materials: a slice of bread (any kind), a sealable plastic bag, a spray bottle, and water. You can use any type of bread, but know that store-bought sandwich bread contains preservatives and will take longer to grow mold. Fresh bread will grow mold faster.A spray bottle is not entirely necessary, but it is an easy way to evenly coat the bread in a fine mist of water. Fill the spray bottle with water before beginning the experiment. If you don’t have a plastic bag, you can replace it with some other sealable clear container. You want it to be clear so you can observe the mold growth and sealable to contain the mold. An old plastic or glass jar would also work.; , Using the spray bottle, lightly spray the piece of bread with a coat of mist. You don’t want the bread to be soaked, you just want there to be some moisture to stimulate the growth of the mold. One spray is sufficient.Alternative methods for keeping the environment moist include:  Placing a wet paper towel in the plastic bag with the bread. Sprinkling some water over the top of the piece of bread. Spraying the inside of the bag instead of directly on the bread.  Place your moistened piece of bread into the plastic bag and seal it closed. For the remainder of the experiment you’ll want to keep this bag sealed to avoid exposing yourself to the mold spores that will grow on the bread.If you have allergies, you might not want to do this experiment as it may cause you difficulty.  Mold thrives in warm environments with moisture in the air.Find a warm place in your home and store the sealed bread here. You’ve already supplied sufficient moisture to the bread for growth.   Mold does not need sunlight to create food; it gets food from the bread itself. This is why mold often grows in dark, damp areas such as basements.  Make daily observations of your bread and track the growth of mold. It should take around 7-10 days before you will be able to see significant growth on the bread. You could see growth as soon as 5 days depending on the type of bread you used. Remember, fresh bread will mold faster than store-bought bread containing preservatives.If you notice the bread has dried out, you may need to add more water. If this is the case, wear rubber gloves and a mask to protect yourself from being exposed to the mold spores.  When you are finished observing the growth of the mold, dispose of the sealed container in the garbage. Do not open the bag. Opening the bag can release mold spores into your environment that are not good for your health.   Wash your hands every time after you have handled the bag.  To test various growth conditions for mold, you will need multiple samples. Moisten as many pieces of bread necessary to test your conditions. Place each one in a separate bag.   For example, if you want to test three different temperatures, make three samples. Before each experiment, make some predictions about what will happen. Make a hypothesis about how quickly the mold will grow under each condition. Write down whether you think there will be more or less mold for each condition at the end of the experiment.  Keep all other conditions the same (temperature and amount of light), but add different levels of moisture. Have one slice with no moisture, one slice that is just damp, and one slice that is soaked in water.  Check the samples daily to see if the growth of mold is different between the three.  To test mold growth at different temperatures, store one sample at room temperature, one in the refrigerator, and one in the freezer.   Remember, to minimize variability, you will want to store the room temperature sample in the dark, as the samples in the fridge and the freezer will mostly be in darkness.Check each sample daily and see which piece of bread grows the most mold the fastest.  If you want to test whether or not light has an effect on the growth of mold, store samples in different light environments. Place one bag in total darkness and another bag in light.   Again, to minimize variability, make sure the temperatures of both environments are the same. If the temperature is also different, you won’t know whether the difference in growth rate is due to the light or the temperature. Observe your samples daily to check for differences in growth rate and amount.  

gather the necessary materials.  spray the bread with water.  seal the bread in the plastic bag.  store the bread in a damp, warm area.  observe the mold growth.  dispose of the bread properly.  make multiple samples of moistened bread.  vary the amount of moisture on each slice of bread.  place each bagged bread sample in a different temperature.  store each bagged sample in areas with different varying light levels. 

 In the first season, Lola's look is is more goth, but in the second season she's more punk, like a cross with /Audrey Kitching style, with the occasional crazy raver look. First season look: Purple shirt over black mini with black fishnets and a long wig. Second season: A good outfit idea is a plain puff sleeved top, a striped tank over it, and a long, puffy skirt (maybe tulle). Then add cool, colorful, patterned tights or socks and arm socks with some crazy chunky jewelry! Don't forget color combos. If you're going for first season, the colors are either darker - red & black or purple & black - or really wild and crazy (go ahead and clash!) For the second season, she usually juggles three colors: two neons and a basic, for example royal blue/hot pink/black.; , In the second season, most of them are short and chin-length in colors like Red, pink, white, light blue, green and more.  Remember, arm socks are great and so are stockings...hit up Claire's and Hot Topic. Chunky, colorful plastic jewelry will round off the look - think big bangles, plastic bead necklaces, and neon. Lot's of charms and big chunky beads with bold colors and patterns.  Lola's character is a bold one, never afraid to say what she thinks! So put on a strut.  If you don't have time, she's confident, cocky, a little loopy and eccentric, and makes you laugh.

 You have to buy something that you can stitch together, but otherwise it’s totally up to you. Use a left over pillowcase or even the old drapes.  There are a couple ways to get a template for your hand puppet. You can buy them at crafts stores, download them online, or make them yourself.          If you want to make a basic hand puppet yourself, put your hand palm down on your piece of fabric. Now draw small dots on the fabric on either side of your hand to designate the width. This is how wide you’ll want the body of your template to be. Once you’ve done that, you can start drawing the outline of your puppet. If you want your puppet to have arms remember that your thumb and pinky will be controlling the arms. Put your hand back down on the fabric and designate where your thumb and pinky emerge from your hand. This is where you’ll want the arms to begin. Make sure you leave room for your fingers in the head of the puppet as well. Your index, middle, and ring finger will need to rest in there, so ensure that it is wide enough for those three fingers to fit inside. Otherwise, the drawing is up to you! Using the width of your hand as your guide make two straight parallel lines. Now round these lines off away from each other diagonally to create the arms. Try to keep them the same length. Keep in mind that they should be pretty short. Once you’ve completed the full outline of the arms draw a wide half circle for the head. Add ears, horns, or whatever else you would like to the outline.  Put the fabric that you drew or traced your template onto on top of the second piece of fabric.         , Try not to cut so much that your hand will not fit in there. Make sure that the two pieces of fabric are lined up well. Once you start cutting make sure that you don't move the two pieces of fabric away from each other at all. If you're worried you can trace your template onto a piece of paper first and then cut one piece of fabric at a time.  Sew around the outline of your cut out fabric. Make sure you leave a hole at the bottom so you can put your hand in there.  You can add string for eyes and a mouth, different colored fabric to give your puppets spots, or anything else you can think of. If you sew on another piece of fabric to your puppet make sure you only sew through one layer of your puppet fabric. Otherwise it will be stuck together.         

buy felt, cloth, or whatever other fabric material you would like to use to make your hand puppet.  make your template.  place two pieces of fabric on top of each other.  cut the template out of both pieces of fabric.  sew the two pieces of fabric together.  embroider your puppet. 

 After receiving the news, many questions may arise. For example, you might wonder if the visual impairment is permanent or reversible. Take advantage of your medical provider’s presence to learn more about blindness or vision loss.Jot down notes and ask for pamphlets of frequently asked questions. If you are a loved one, take the opportunity to ask any questions you may have. Always bring a friend or family member with you to an appointment. They can help you remember things and even take notes for you if your nerves are shaken. It may also be advisable to seek a second opinion or conduct research to gain a better understanding of the condition. Not all your questions need to be asked when a diagnosis is made. Take time to do research, write down your questions, and make a follow-up appointment to get them answered.; , Loss of vision is a traumatic experience for which you will likely grieve for several days, weeks, or even months after your diagnosis. You may be overcome with shock, denial, fear, or confusion as to how your life will change due to your condition. Give yourself time to properly mourn.Practice self-compassion. If you only want to lie in bed all day, give yourself the liberty to do that. Cry. Vent your frustration or anger to loved ones. Do whatever you need to cope during this upsetting time. While a period of grief is normal, don’t allow yourself to wallow in despair for too long. Grief will happen in stages, and some days will be better than others. However, generally good moments should increase over time. If you find yourself stuck in depression, speak with a doctor.  If you have trouble moving forward after losing your vision, there are professionals who can assist you. Vision loss is linked to serious conditions like anxiety or depression. Whether you simply need someone to talk to about your feelings, or need specific guidance related to blindness or visual impairment, you can find trained counselors who are willing to help, and who may even be able to track your recovery and make sure you are progressing. Depending on your status, you may be able to locate a counselor who is able to provide in-home services. These counselors will offer valuable support and guidance as you cope with the news and adjust to blindness or visual impairment. Ask your doctor to refer you to a counselor in your area. The impact of having a closed loved one such as a child with vision loss may also cause emotional pain. Parents and other family may benefit from talking to a counselor, too.  Learning to live with blindness or visual impairment requires obtaining an entirely new set of skills for doing everyday activities. You can sign up for special adjustment classes that are directed at teaching you new skills or alternative practices so that you can live as independently as you’d like.   You can locate training courses in your area by talking to your doctor or therapist. You will likely be appointed a liaison who will also provide support and guidance as you navigate the adjustment. In addition, you can reach out to organizations that advocate for blind or visually impaired individuals like the American Foundation for the Blind or the Royal National Institute of Blind People which can connect you with local programs.You may also be able to schedule appointments with an occupational therapist who can help you with your adjustment. Talk to your medical provider or insurance company to help you locate the right occupational therapist for you.  Another aspect of mobilizing yourself to take action after vision loss is getting a firm handle on modern technology use. Technology can be a lifesaver for people with blindness or visual impairment because it can help them stay mobile and maintain independence.   Depending on the level of visual impairment you have, you can turn to a wide selection of assistive technology devices that are specially designed for people with vision loss. Devices might include screen readers as well as braille watches and printers for the blind and magnifiers for people with low vision. In addition, you can learn techniques to make general technology like smartphones and computers more accessible to accommodate your condition. Such tips will likely be introduced in your adjustment classes, or through occupational therapy specialized for people with visual impairment.  If you suffer from a visual impairment that has drastically reduced your ability to see, you might benefit from a variety of commonly used low vision aids that can support your mobility and functioning. Many of these devices may have some technological aspect, too.   Low vision aids are handheld or stationary assistive devices that filter light or magnify. Examples may include telescopic glasses, magnifying glasses, and reading prisms., Your medical provider may have assigned you a special liaison professional to help you get necessary assistance you need to adjust to your new lifestyle. However, if you were not appointed a contact person, you will need to find a local community clinic for the blind or visually impaired. Such clinics can help you get access to all the resources you need such as transportation, occupational training, and support groups.   In addition, a number of charity or volunteer organizations exist to support and provide services for the blind or visually impaired. These organizations vary by geographic region, but you can locate them by reaching out to your medical provider, counselor, or an advocate at a low vision clinic., After learning of your vision loss diagnosis, you might wish to isolate yourself from others to grieve. You might suffer from a loss of self-esteem or worry how people will perceive you. Resist the urge to withdraw from your support network. Social support is one of the healthiest ways to cope with your new reality.If you have others in your household, take advantage of their presence to fulfill your natural need to connect. If you live alone, make an effort to have a meal with others or spend time with a loved one at least once a week. Let your friends and family know when you need to talk or if you simply need a hug. You might say, “I’m feeling really sad today. Do you mind watching a movie with me?” You may feel the urge to spend more time alone while you process and begin to recover. This is normal, but it is important to make sure that you do not isolate yourself too much.  Support groups are an essential aspect of coping with vision loss for both blind and visually impaired individuals and their families. Others who are going through similar experiences as well as their loved ones participate in these groups to build community and share their experiences.   Making the acquaintance of others like you may help you feel less alone. You may even learn helpful strategies to adjust to your condition or function more effectively in your job, at school, at home or in your relationships. Find support groups through your doctor, counselor, low-vision liaison, or by searching for groups online., In addition to connecting with others experiencing vision loss in support groups, it might be encouraging to locate blind or visually impaired public figures and others with notable reputations to learn about their unique trials and tribulations.   Understand that at times you will feel sorry for yourself. It is alright to want validation and seek support for your struggle, but it is also important to look at your situation as a challenge that you can readily meet with the right resources. Keep in mind that millions of people suffer from vision loss and still lead rewarding, autonomous lives., It can be easy to get lost in grief over your vision loss and forget how fortunate you are in other ways. Perhaps you or your loved one suffers from vision loss, but has a clean bill of health otherwise. Keep things in perspective so that you are able to fully enjoy your life despite your circumstances.   It may help to start a gratitude journal. Take a moment each day to jot down a few things you are grateful for. These might include "a supportive family" or "a healthy brain and heart.", Being blind or visually impaired may cause you to give in to negative thinking. You might harshly judge yourself for relying on the help of others or view yourself as worthless. Overcome negative thinking patterns by simply choosing to reflect on the positives. Affirmations can be a powerful way to rebuild your self-esteem.Each morning as you complete your routine, you might repeat “I am worthy despite being blind/visually impaired. I will thrive,” for example. Turn to similar affirmations when you are suffering from a confidence blow or when you are faced with challenges as you adjust to your vision loss.

 Establish whether this is going to be a large party or a smaller gathering. Knowing the size of the party in advance will help you create a more accurate budget and get the right amount of food and non-alcoholic beverages.; , Write down a list of the people you are going to ask to come. Be sure to invite people who you know will be comfortable not drinking. The goal of the party might be to have guests not even notice that there isn't alcohol being served. This will be hard to do if you invite guests that you know rely on alcohol to have a good time or guests that keep bringing up the fact that there is no alcohol.  Although you don’t need to send invitations until you have decided on a theme and a date, you may want to decide the format in advance. Be sure to let people know there won't be alcohol at the party.   Invite people through Facebook. You can create a Facebook event in a matter of minutes. If you’re short on time and the party is coming up, social media is a great way to spread the word. Send paper invites. Depending on the ages of the people you are inviting to the party, paper invitations may be a better choice. For example, if your guests are older adults, they may not use social media. Paper invites require slightly more time, and they can add to your total party costs.  The best themes for your party align with your guests’ interests. Think about the ages and genders of your invitees. Since this will be a party without alcohol, some themes like wine and cheese or others based around alcoholic beverages won’t be appropriate. However, a theme will be important and need to be prominent for it to be a fabulous party.Focus on an upcoming holiday. Seasonal themes, such as a Halloween costume party or an ugly sweater Christmas party, can be popular with your guests. Base the party on food. Your theme can be as simple as a potluck where everyone brings a food item to share, or it can be something more creative like a make-your-own-pizza party or cookie decorating. Use a pop culture theme. If the invitees are all interested in a certain TV show or movie, such as Game of Thrones, this can set your theme. Be sure the theme is something that will appeal to the entire guest list so no one is left out. Host a costume party. There are limitless themes in this area. You can hold a party based on the styles of a particular decade, for instance. If guests are expected to dress up to add to the theme, be sure to inform them in advance.  The theme serves as a guideline for a lot of the details of the party. Some themes may not require a great deal of decorations, but they always add something. For example, a Halloween party can always benefit from spooky decorations to set the mood.  The food you serve at the party can work with the theme, but it’s also important to decide if you will be serving a meal or hors d’oeuvres. The guest list will help you determine how much food you need. The food will be especially important since there won't be alcohol.   Have alternative foods for guests. Be aware of any allergies or dietary restrictions guests may have so you can work around this. Choose foods that fit the theme. If you’re holding a party based on a movie or other specific theme, you can include food items that are reminiscent of it. For example, if you’re hosting a Harry Potter party, offer cookies with glasses or lightning bolts.  Parties with alcohol often don’t have many planned activities, but you will want to schedule something for a fun party without alcohol. It helps steer the party in the right direction.   If you're throwing a party with a lot of people who know each other, you may not need to do much to have a fun time without alcohol. It can be simple entertainment, such as watching the movie that gave the party its theme. , There are a number of fun games intended for parties, such as Apples to Apples, Cards Against Humanity, or Catchphrase. These also serve as icebreakers for guests who may not know each other, which can help guests mingle at a party where alcohol isn't served. Choose a classic. Charades and other party games have been around for a long time, but they can still make your party a hit. Rather being general, charades can align with your theme. Make up your own game. If you can't find a game that fits your theme, create your own game. This can be bonding experience for guests. Write down the rules for the game so they will be easy to follow. You can even put a non-alcoholic spin on a drinking game, like Sprite pong instead of beer pong.  If there is going to be down time during the party, such as when guests are eating dinner, a themed playlist can help set the mood. You can either choose your own songs or use a streaming service like Pandora or Spotify to pick a playlist that fits the theme.  Fortunately, you won’t have to worry about providing alcohol for your guests, but other party expenses can add up. It’s important to make a budget before sending out invitations because you may need to adjust your plans to keep costs down.   Get quotes from caterers. If you decide to utilize a catering service, contact a few different companies in the area to get an idea of price before making your selection.  Without alcohol, food will likely be the bulk of your party expenses. You may want to consider catering if you can afford it, which could cover a dinner or appetizers. You can easily avoid hiring a caterer and have a fabulous party.  Depending on the theme of your party, you may want to offer favors for guests. For example, if you were hosting an 80s dance party, you could give guests neon bracelets and other accessories. It’s important to factor the cost of these items into your total budget.  Party decorations help set the theme, but you don’t need to go overboard. If you are trying to cut back on expenses, you may want to select inexpensive decorations, make your own, or purchase items that can be reused in the future.  Just because there won’t be alcohol at the party doesn’t mean you have to stick to offering your guests nothing besides water or soda. Many cocktail recipes can be adjusted to leave out the alcohol. Pinterest is a great source of ideas and recipes for non-alcoholic drinks.   Search by theme. If you're trying to get drink ideas, try searching based on your theme. You may find recipes you hadn't thought to use.  The non-alcoholic beverages you serve can enhance the theme of your party. For example, if you are hosting a tropical party, you can use tiki glasses and paper umbrellas.  If your party has a seasonal theme, there may be a beverage that fits right in. For example, if it's a fall harvest party, you could serve warm apple cider. Peppermint hot chocolate would be perfect for a Christmas or winter party.  Make sure your house is tidy before your guests start arriving. Pay close attention to the areas where people will be, like the kitchen, living room, and bathroom. As you're cleaning, set up decorations, leaving yourself enough time to be thorough.  Purchase all the food, snacks, and refreshments you were planning to have at your party. Depending on what you will be offering, you may need to cook some things, such as cookies or other baked goods, in advance to save time. Be sure to leave yourself enough time for everything that will need to be done ahead of time.   Write a schedule. Parties often have many different aspects. Write a list of everything you will need to do and choose times to accomplish each item. Ask a friend for help. Setting up for a party can be a lot of work, so you can ask a friend or family member for assistance so everything looks perfect when guests start to arrive.  After the hard work of organizing an event, enjoy yourself. Circulate and talk to each of your guests. Have fun with the activities you’ve planned for the party.  

determine the size of the party.  decide who you want to invite.  choose an invitation format.  choose your theme.  choose decorations based on the theme.  plan the menu.  plan fun activities.  play games.  make a playlist.  calculate how much you can spend on a party.  add up food expenses.  decide whether you will have party favors.  choose your decorations.  gather inspiration.  choose drinks that add to the theme.  offer seasonal drinks.  clean the house.  prepare food and beverages.  have fun!

 You have to be careful about what materials you use to construct your Leyden jar. The material must serve as an insulator between the inner charge (+) and the outer charge (-). Choose a glass jar or a plastic bottle with a lid., You will need a conductive material inside the jar in order to charge it. Traditionally, water was used inside the jar. To build a more modern Leyden jar, you should line the inside of the jar with metal foil (tin foil, aluminum foil, etc). Your conductive material will become positively charged when you charge the Leyden jar., You will need an electrode protruding from the jar to charge the inside of the jar. You can do this by hammering a nail through the lid of the jar. Make sure that the nail goes far enough into the jar to contact the conducting surface inside the jar (water, foil, etc.).You can also connect a chain or other conductive material to the nail and allow it to hang down and touch the inner conducting surface.  Wrap only the bottom and part of the sides of the jar. Stop short of the mouth of the jar. The foil on the outside of the jar should not contact the foil on the inside of the jar. The outer foil will have a negative charge with respect to the inner foil. 

choose a jar.  place foil inside the jar.  insert an electrode into the lid.  wrap foil around the outside of the jar.

 Ensure that you have all the knowledge of relevant topics associated with that particular charity. The more facts you know the better you can answer any question that the person you approach may ask. For example: What is it all about?, Who benefits?, Why would anyone want to support that?, Will it improve my community?, will my efforts make a visible difference?; , Ask the charity committee for any information they can spare (on paper).  This article would suggest that you approach schools, churches, local businesses etc. instead of just handing out flyer's in the street. As an example, arrange a meeting with the local school headmaster. Handing them all of the relevant documents proves that you are asking them to support a legitimate charitable organization. For example, the benefits coming out of the charity would be the goodness that could come to the community and how wonderful it would be to have that schools youth actively involved.   Recruit your friends and family. There are many ways to get people involved, the easiest is to convince your friends and family first. Focus on getting them actively involved.  Ensure that you are clear as to what type of support you are asking for. Remember that they will have to take the idea to others in a positive and exciting way.  The volunteers that sign up might have to be contacted later for additional information. This means that key information to record will include name & surname, contact number, age and description of what they volunteer to help with.  You will need to do a follow up meeting with your volunteers as soon as practically possible to give additional information, answer questions and relay what you will require of them.  Someone from the charity organisation will have to be available for people to contact if they have any questions. Ensuring that your volunteers can contact you in the event that they might have to cancel or if they have additional questions that need answering is very important.  If you are unable to answer a question accurately, direct them to someone who can. This article strongly suggest that the reader does not guess an answer to a question especially when it comes to distribution of funds and so on, as this might reflect badly on the organization of that charity.  If you keep the meetings with your volunteer fun, exciting and informative, you have less chance of disappointment on the day of the charity event with volunteers that just didn't show up or who is not enthusiastic about it.  After the event, keep the records of your volunteers and note what their responsibilities were at the time of the event. That way, you have a database for the next event. This means that the same volunteers could be reached if necessary preventing you from repeating 90% of your work, leaving you more time for other things.  

be knowledgeable.  have all relevant documentation with you.  ask people that you know to help you recruit.  be specific.  record all contact information.  conduct meetings.  ensure contact availability.  direct a difficult question.  have fun!,  compile and preserve any record keeping.

 You may love to hear about grand romantic gestures, but unless your partner is a millionaire it's a little silly to expect them. In fact, the average person spends only about $142 on Valentine's Day gifts. This may sound like a lot, but keep in mind how averages work. For every wealthy individual who buys a lover an expensive sports car, thousands of others may only go with a $10 box of chocolates or a cheap bottle of wine., Many people wait to surprise their significant others with a gift in the evening. This is especially important to remember if you and your partner don't live together. Don't jump to conclusions if you wake up and don't find a bouquet at your door.  Moping around is the worst thing you can do. If you are seriously upset, try your best to pretend it's not Valentine's Day at all. Unlike most major holidays, Valentine's Day is relatively easy to ignore. Try not to listen to the radio or watch television; advertisements and talk show chatter will probably be Valentine's Day-oriented.  If you work on Valentine's Day, you may see coworkers with flowers or chocolates. Don't be jealous of them. You have no idea what their relationships may really be like. Flashy displays of affection through monetary goods don't reflect how someone truly feels. Try your best to remember all the times where your partner has shown you love.  Surprise your partner with a gift when you were originally planning to do so. Withholding a gift because you expect one yourself is petty. Your partner may have actually gotten something for you after all but was unsure of the right time to exchange gifts.  Even in the age of Internet shopping and free shipping, sometimes things can get away from us. Don't expect too much if your significant other's parent passed away the week before.   For anxious perfectionists, shopping for the right gift can take a lot of time and effort. Your partner may have had to deal with an unexpected deadline at work and had to temporarily put everything else on hold. Just be sure to let them know how you feel if you're disappointed., At any point, did either of you mention anything about disliking Valentine's Day or not wanting a gift?   Some people feel obligated to say that they don't want a gift when they actually expect one to avoid seeming shallow or greedy. If you expressed this, your significant other may have taken your words at face value. Work on communicating your desires more honestly. Your partner may have had a negative or traumatic experience associated with Valentine's Day and may feel uncomfortable celebrating it. If you consider your relationship close, ask about what happened and if there's anything you can do to help the healing process.  If your partner doesn't realize it's Valentine's Day, there is absolutely no reason to get upset.   Some people are just very forgetful about dates. If your partner apologizes and offers to make it up to you soon, accept the offer gracefully. Others may be new to dating and are unsure about the gift-giving etiquette that surrounds the holiday. If you are more experienced, explain the unwritten rules to your significant other. This may be a good opportunity for you each to define how serious you think the relationship may be.Your partner may be from another country and doesn't even know what Valentine's Day is. Many cultures celebrate Valentine's Day in very different ways, and some don't observe it at all. If that's the case, simply explain to your significant other the importance of this holiday to you. Suggest to celebrate and exchange gifts on a certain day at least a week or two away., If you just had your first date on February 12, don't expect your new partner to surprise you with a bouquet of roses. Conversely, if you've been together for years, it's not unusual to skip Valentine's Day. On average, married couples spend significantly less on their partners than couples who are dating.If you're upset about a missed Valentine's Day and your partner doesn't appear concerned or apologetic, this can be a bad sign. This is especially true if your significant other even goes so far as to tease or admonish you for caring about the holiday. While Valentine's Day may have become a marketing gimmick, you have every right to enjoy the holiday. When one partner invalidates another's feelings, their relationship may be unhealthy., Tell your partner that you enjoy celebrating Valentine's Day and were hoping for a gift. Suggest the possibility of an alternative "Valentine's Day" just for the two of you.   Be sure to use "I-statements" while discussing the subject. I-statements usually begin with "I feel" and go on to explain your emotions. In conflict resolution theory, I-statements allow you to express emotions caused by another's actions (or inactions) without blame. An example I-statement for this situation would be: "I feel a little disappointed that I didn't receive a Valentine's Day gift from you this year." Remember to reaffirm that you care about your partner. Be clear that while you may be disappointed, your relationship isn't in jeopardy.Don't have this conversation while angry. If this experience has seriously upset you, calm yourself first by going for a walk or sleeping on it.Tell your partner what kind of gifts you like. There is nothing wrong with asking for what you want, and it's an important part of honest communication.Some people have very particular tastes or don't like receiving gifts. Don't force your significant other to read your mind.  

avoid high expectations.  try not to react at all until at least after dinner.  go about your day as normally as possible.  steer clear of jealousy.  give your gift.  remember any life events that may have made it difficult for your partner to shop.  think about your conversations from the last few weeks.  ask if your partner knows what today is.  consider your relationship status.  explain your feelings to your partner. 

 For this, you will need a green tie, a ruler, a pencil, Scotch masking tape, and a silver paint pen. It is best if you buy an inexpensive green tie, as you will likely not be getting too much use out of it. Also, be sure the tie is in a Slytherin shade, meaning evergreen as opposed to lime or mint green.   Use the ruler to measure one inch from the very bottom point of the tie. Make a small mark with the pencil at the one inch mark, and then run the Scotch tape along this mark in a diagonal line. Repeat this all the way up the tie. Use the paint pen to completely fill in the spaces between the Scotch tape. Make sure there is no green showing. Allow the tie to dry before removing the tape. If done properly, you should have a series of even diagonal lines on your tie.; , Make sure the collar is very pressed, as no Slytherin would go out looking anything less than polished. Tie on the tie. If you do not wish to make a tie, you may order a green and silver or green and white scarf. Careful, as these may be hard to find.  You may use a grey sweater vest or sweater, as long as it has a relatively low neckline. Be sure to tuck in your tie.  Many people choose darker wash jeans for their look though, and either are alright.  You can also make a proper robe on your own.  There are a wide variety of crests out there. Choose one you like from the Internet, print it, cut it our carefully, and glue to a piece of felt. Trim the felt around the edges of the crest. Sew or pin the crest to your shirt or cloak.  Girls should straighten or neatly curl their hair, and boys should comb their hair over or back.  

make a slytherin tie.  put on a white collared shirt.  pull a v-neck grey top over your white shirt.  black dress pants for boys and a black skirt or pants for a girl are the correct wear.  you may stop here, or you may use a large black shrug or cardigan as a robe.  wear the slytherin crest.  finish off the look with a sleek and polished hairstyle. 

 Everyone has areas they need to improve upon. You may have bad habits that annoy your partner. However, there's a difference between expressing irritation and being outright critical. An overly critical, even mean, partner is a sign you're not in a good relationship.Does your partner frequently put you down? Are you mocked for your intelligence, personality, or physical appearance? Do you feel like you can't do anything right? Your partner may, for example, say something like, "God, I knew you'd screw that up. You're so bad at these things" when you get directions wrong. You may hear these comments a lot throughout the day.; , In a healthy relationship, you should be able to feel like you can lean on the other person for emotional support. In an unhealthy relationship, however, the other person may be cold or uncaring to your needs. When you've had a bad day, think about who you would call.You may feel comfortable going to your partner first. He or she may always know what to say or do to make you feel better. However, your first inclination may be to reach out to someone else. You may, for example, find yourself leaning more frequently on a friend or family member. Your partner may be dismissive of your problems, or treat you like a burden. If you're hesitant to ask your partner for emotional support, you may be in a bad relationship.  Do you feel like you can trust your partner? If not, the relationship may be bad. Has your partner struggled in the past with something like infidelity? Did your partner cross other boundaries, like borrowing money and not returning it? If you don't feel like you can trust your partner, you may be in a bad relationship.For example, you may not trust your partner to handle expenses. If they borrow money from you, you may distrust whether you'll ever get the money back. You may also not trust your partner's loyalty. You may be suspicious of whether or not they will be faithful. They may have had issues with fidelity in the past.  In a healthy relationship, your partner will want you to have your own life and independent interests. In a bad relationship, your partner will constantly seek control. Be honest with yourself. Do you feel like your partner attempts to control you?Control can come in many forms. Your partner may dictate how you dress and act or may try to control how you spend your time. Your partner may dislike it when you spend time engaging in hobbies or going out with friends. A controlling partner will want you all to themselves. If you spend an evening reading, for example, your partner may berate you later. He or she may say something like, "You know, you worked all day and then you just read all night. I'm not sure why you need to read when you could have spent some time with me."  , Do you feel like your partner is excited for your successes? Do they seem indifferent, or even hostile, when good things happen to you? In a negative relationship, your partner will be threatened by your success instead of happy for you. They will see your dreams, goals, and aspirations as competition for their attention.Your partner may put down your attempts to grow and change. Instead of encouraging you, your partner has only negative things to say about you taking steps towards a more successful future. For example, say you're an aspiring writer. You join a book club to meet more writers in your area. Your partner says something like, "You know, it's really petty of you to try and impress other writers. You should rely on the quality of your work and not what important friends you have."  , If you are in a bad relationship, then there may be some manipulation going on. This is when someone does things to try to get you to do what they want or vice versa. Some common manipulative behaviors include:Giving you the silent treatment or pretending not to know what you are talking about. Trying to overwhelm you with facts and statistics. Yelling or screaming at you or talking over you. Pressuring you to make decisions without letting you think about them. Ridiculing you or belittling you. Judging you or criticizing you. Blaming you for their unhappiness or for other problems.  In a healthy relationship, you and your partner have separate identities. You may have different friends groups and different interests. You should be able to retain your own relationships, hobbies, and interests in a healthy relationship.In a bad relationship, your partner will be threatened or angered by this. They may insist on doing hobbies with you, even hobbies you would rather do alone. They may discourage you from seeing friends they don't like, or talking too much to your family. If you're beginning to feel your identity is entirely wrapped up in your partner, this is a problem. In a bad relationship, you end up losing your sense of self.  How do you feel when you spend time with your partner? Does their drama tend to affect you personally? Do you leave their place feeling drained rather than energized? In a healthy relationship, you and your partner should bring one another up. You should feel happy and energetic around your partner. If the reverse is true, you may be in a bad relationship., In a bad relationship, you'll be made to feel guilty frequently. You may feel like your partner's unhappiness or outbursts are your fault. Be honest with yourself. How often do you feel guilty in this relationship?Do you feel you need to stay due to guilt? Does your partner rely on you to the point you feel you're taking care of them? If guilt is a major emotion in your relationship, it may be a bad sign. If you're staying because your partner makes you feel guilty for not being around, this is probably a bad relationship.  Can you really see a future with this person? Some relationships are not made to last. It's okay if you're casually dating someone you don't want a serious future with. However, if this is a serious relationship, you want to consider the future.Do you think this person would be a good parent? If you want kids, and you worry about this person's competency as a mother or father, you may be in a bad relationship. Think long and hard about the type of life you want. Is this person compatible with that life? If not, this may not be a good relationship to pursue.  In a bad relationship, you may not enjoy the good times. Even when things are going well, and you should be having fun, you're on edge. This is often because your partner is easy to set off, and you're worried they will start drama at any moment.For example, you go out to brunch with friends. Your partner complains about the menu for a moment, starts to get hostile, but calms down. The rest of brunch is fine and everyone seems to be having fun. Even though everything is fine, you're worried. You keep thinking about the issue with the menu. You can't enjoy the good time, because there's part of you that's worried the issue will resurface later.  Allowing yourself to be vulnerable with your partner is an important part of a good relationship. If you do not trust your partner enough to share your personal thoughts and feelings with them, then it might not be a good relationship.For example, if you withhold information about your hopes, fears, and dreams because you do not trust your partner to be kind and understanding, then you might be in a bad relationship.  You do not want to end a bad relationship ambiguously. If you make the decision to end things, do so face-to-face. Tell your partner you want out of the relationship, leaving no room for confusion.Say something direct like, "I don't think we should see each other romantically anymore." Then, let your partner know what boundaries you need. For example, can you remain friends? If so, will you need space initially? Make it clear how much contact you want. Can you stay friends on social media? Can you still text on occasion? These are all things you need to decide moving forward.  If you have had bad relationship before, this is particularly important. For you, are there any perks to bad relationships? Is there a reason you're habitually drawn to the wrong people?A bad relationship may fill a void in your life. For example, maybe your mother was distant. You unconsciously seek out people like your mother, but find they are just as distant and difficult. Try to identify any underlying needs that are being fulfilled by bad relationship. Work on getting away from these kinds of romances in the future.  When ending a bad relationship, you'll be left vulnerable. Seek the support of loved ones. Reach out to friends and family members. Let them know you're going through a rough patch and would appreciate some support.Call friends when you're having a bad day. You can also send out text messages asking for support. People who care about you will be willing to help you cope with your emotions. It can be hard to ask for support, but just start with a simple request. For example, "Hey, I'm really struggling with this breakup. Mind if I vent to you?"  , Many people often go back to bad relationships. You may feel a sense of comfort and safety from a relationship, even a bad one.Have an action plan in place. If you feel tempted to, say, call or text your ex, think of something to do instead. You could call a friend, watch television, go for a walk, or engage in a hobby. Figure out many ways to keep busy. Fill your life with distractions from a bad relationship so you won't be tempted to go back.  

think about how often you're criticized.  consider who you turn to for emotional support.  evaluate the level of trust.  be honest about whether you feel controlled.  recognize how much support you receive.  watch for manipulative behaviors.  evaluate your own sense of identity.  check on your own energy levels.  monitor your sense of guilt.  be realistic about the future.  meditate on your feelings during good times.  decide if you feel comfortable enough to be vulnerable.  end things clearly.  identify why you were drawn to the relationship.  seek out support.  make a plan to stay out of the relationship. 

 Relationships strain when one or both partners feel hurt – whether because of a fight, careless words, or long-term resentments. All relationships go through this to some extent. The important thing is to reach out and apologize when you’ve done wrong. Apologizing shows your commitment to your partner and the relationship. To apologize well, you have to be sincere, specific, and recognize the hurt you caused. Accept your role in having damaged trust or respect in the relationship. This doesn’t mean accepting all responsibility, but owning up to your part.  Be sincere and specific. Only apologize to make amends and heal damage and not for some other ulterior reason. At the same time, be specific about what you are apologizing for and how it hurt the other person. For example, “I’m very sorry that I stormed off during our argument. I can see that it hurt you and made you feel humiliated. Please forgive me.” Avoid weasel-worded apologies. These don’t really accept any responsibility and come off as insincere, i.e. “I’m sorry if what I did offended you” or “I’m sorry if you took it the wrong way.” Don’t request an apology in return. Mutual forgiveness is important, but your partner may need time to process his or her feelings. Asking for an apology will only seem like a demand.; , An apology is only the first part of reaching out. It won’t fix things but can break the ice and start the healing process. Don’t be surprised if your partner reacts emotionally or even interrupts you. Resist the urge to interrupt and defend yourself, though, and instead be patient and respectful and listen.Try not to react defensively or insist on “finishing” your side of the story. Your first urge may be to correct or refute your partner, but instead let him speak. By showing patience, you also let your partner speak openly without fear or reprisal and demonstrate that you’re serious about healing the rift. Keep in mind that the point of an apology is to heal the relationship. It is not about proving who was right and who was wrong.  Make it clear to your partner that you want to save the relationship. At the same time, accept that these things take time. Resist the urge to pursue your partner, especially one who has become distant, or you may end up driving him further away. Allow for some time and space while leaving the door open to reconciliation. Be clear that you are ready to talk if and when your partner is ready. Make sure he or she knows you are open to communication. At the same time, people often want physical and emotional space after an argument or hurt. Try to recognize and respect this need for distance – do not hound your partner.  Counseling isn’t a sure-fire fix, but it can help you air and work out problems as well as learn how to communicate more effectively with your partner. Consider couples counseling if your relationship is in trouble. However, even going to counseling on your own can be helpful.Ask your partner to go to counseling with you if you’ve been having communications or trust issues, if you’ve grown distant and are just “occupying the same space,” or if one of you is acting on negative feelings. Try to find a counselor that you both can work with. This may take several tries. Ask potential counselors questions about their credentials, experience, fitness to help you, and success rate. Think of a counselor as a consultant rather than a fixer. A counselor will advise you, but the most important work will occur outside of your sessions. Consider finding a counselor or therapist even if your partner refuses to attend.  To fight for a relationship, you’ll need to face problems head-on and not just paper them over, allowing them to fester. With a counselor or not, be ready to talk deeply about the issues in your relationship. This isn’t easy. It means revisiting old hurts, talking about resentments, and expressing disappointment.Be ready to listen to your partner. The key to moving forward is to attend and understand past hurt with empathy. Be willing to express your own frustrations. But always do so tactfully. Resist the urge to blame or justify behaviors in the past and instead look to understand the underlying motives – you may see that these were not as malicious as you thought. Recall what drew you together. There was a reason you and your partner ended up together in the first place. Try to reflect together on why you loved each other and whether it’s possible to regain that spark.  Putting your feelings out in the open will help you to understand motivations and needs, so learning how to talk and even disagree is critical. It can help you and your partner reassess assumptions about one another as well as to state your needs, clearly and openly.If you are having counseling, make sure to talk about effective communication with your counselor. Follow the rules of effective communication and “fighting fair.” For example, try to avoid accusatory language – start sentences with “I think...” or “I feel...” rather than saying things like “You always...” or “You never...” Avoid generalizations, as well. Be specific and stick to the facts and your feelings. Talk about what you need from your partner, not what you think they are failing to give you, i.e., “I need but don’t feel your support for my career as a businesswoman.” Or, try “I feel ignored, because I want and need more public affection from you” instead of “You ignore me because you never show affection in public.” Invite the other person’s point of view. Don’t interrupt, but listen and then try to restate what you’ve heard.  To really fight for your relationship, you have to be willing to take your partner as a whole person – even the habits and behaviors you may dislike or resent. This is no small challenge. But it’s a necessary one if you want to salvage your connection.Try to see things from the other side. Say you’ve always hated your partner’s messiness. Try to reverse the situation and see his point of view: is he really so messy, or are you overly concerned with tidiness? Accept that you don’t have control over your partner or your partner’s background and raising. Seeing his “incorrect” habits as a reflection of upbringing or deeply held priorities and values can help to soften the tension. Maintain certain boundaries, though. You are under no obligation at all to accept destructive or abusive behavior.  To save a relationship, you’ll not only have to compromise on small things like habits and behavior but also on the larger feeling that you’re in the “right.” This attitude isn’t usually helpful. It can prevent you from changing the way you see your partner, and yourself.Remind yourself that if one of you is right, the other is not necessarily wrong. Your partner’s contrasting opinions don’t invalidate yours – they are just different. For example, your notions of etiquette – how to act, talk, and socialize politely – might be very different from your partner’s. But one of these views is not necessarily more correct than the other. They are simply different.  Probably the most important thing in fighting for a relationship is building empathy. And the result of accepting your partner’s opinions and values should be an effort on your part to try to meet his or her emotional and physical needs, as best you can, without compromising yourself.Be open to compromise so long as your partner’s needs don’t break with your own values. For example, say religion is very important to your partner but not to you. Are you willing to support this part of his or her life? Or say you’ve squabbled over affection and now realize that your partner expresses affection is different ways than you, maybe through gifts or gestures. Are you willing to learn this “language”? An effort on your part will make your partner feel more valued.  Sometimes we want to fight for a relationship that has ended or is in the process of ending. This is not an uncommon thing. In fact, as many as 50% of younger adults reportedly reconcile at least once after a breakup. Try to read the signals to see if your ex is still interested in you.Be subtle. Your ex may feel badgered if you overdo things – so it’s best to keep your distance, at least at first. Don’t force contact and avoid having friends investigate on your behalf. Try to glean hints from things like social media, from people like mutual friends, or from your ex-partner if you are still have some contact. Remember: the odds are probably in your favor.  If you are still interested and have reason to think your ex is, too, you’ll need to reach out. Try something low-key. Send your ex-partner a short message on Facebook, for example, or a short email. Be brief and do not be overbearing, otherwise you may scare her away.Have a reason for initiating contact. For example, say something like “I was eating ice cream today and it made me think of how much you love Chunky Monkey. How are you doing?” Or, “I just saw your name on Facebook and thought I’d say hi. I hope you’re doing well.” Let your ex’s response guide the next move. If the reply is curt, i.e. “Yeah, hope you’re well too,” your prospect of a reconciliation might not be good. A more effusive response can indicate interest. Try to arrange a meeting if the response is positive. Ask to talk over coffee or a drink, for example. Make it clear that you just want a short meeting, with no strings attached.  Know what you want to say beforehand and how you want to say it. Choose your words carefully, because your ex probably still harbors strong feelings for you – both good ones and bad. Say what’s on your mind – express regret, apologize if you need to – but be tactful.   Say that you are sorry things didn’t work out and want to talk to put the relationship in perspective, i.e. “I just wanted to see how you’ve been and to talk about what went wrong between us.” Let the discussion guide what you say. Don’t press the issue if your ex is happy and seeing other people, but gradually steer the conversation toward reconciliation if he seems to retain strong feelings for you. Take things slowly if your ex wants to rekindle the relationship. There were probably good reasons why things ended, issues that you’ll need to talk through seriously, maybe in counseling. Be ready to move on if your ex isn’t interested in reconnecting. At the very least, know that you can have final closure on the matter.  

apologize, if need be.  listen to your partner.  leave the door open, but don’t over-pursue.  seek counseling together or as an individual.  be ready to explore your past history.  learn to express your feelings constructively.  learn to accept your partner.  let go of feelings of superiority.  honor and support your partner’s needs.  find out if your ex is still interested.  make contact.  clear the air. 

 Divorce is often threatened during heated arguments, usually out of anger or frustration, to gain power and control over the other person, and to finally be taken seriously that you want real change.Remind yourself that divorcing your partner is a huge decision, mentally, emotionally, and financially. You will also need to be willing to let go of a strong emotional attachment to your partner, so you should try to make the decision to get a divorce from a clear, unemotional standpoint. Ask yourself: What is my intent in getting a divorce? Any other agenda, other than ending the marriage, is an indication you may not be ready to get a divorce. Divorce has no power to right wrongs or change people’s hearts. Divorce can only end your marriage and your relationship with your partner. Keep in mind that spouses who consistently threaten divorce can lose credibility with themselves and their partner. So, if you are serious about getting a divorce, you will need to express this to your partner in a clear, but appropriate way.; , In most cases, both spouses are usually aware there is something wrong with the marriage. You may have tried marital therapy together, done individual counseling, or had discussions about the troubles in the relationship. If possible, try to pursue counseling or therapy together first before jumping into a conversation about divorce.If the feelings are mutual, you and your husband will have more options. If your husband has no idea, it can be a devastating conversation. Surprising your husband with this difficult news may also result in a more difficult transition for you both during the separation.  This is going to likely be a very hard conversation to have with your husband. So get out a piece of paper and write down a few possible things you may include when you tell your husband about the divorce.Keep in mind you are about to break some bad news that will probably evoke strong emotions. Compose a few sentences that do not contain strong language or an angry tone. Focus on using neutral language. Make “I” statements, such as: “Michael, I have some difficult news to tell you. I have reached a conclusion that you and I need to divorce.” Avoid giving any false hope to your husband if you are serious about the divorce. Saying something like: “I haven’t been happy for a long time. But I want to see if we can work on some of the things that are troubling me” will give your husband the impression you want to fix the marriage. So if this is not your intent, avoid statements like this., Choose a time when you are both alone and no one is going to barge in during the conversation. Look for a space in your home, like the living room or the dining room, that is quiet and comfortable.   Turn off your cell phone and ask your husband to do the same. If you have children, ask a family member to watch them while you talk to your husband, uninterrupted.  Perhaps you are divorcing for troubling reasons, like your husband’s angry or abusive behavior. If this is the care, have a third party present like a therapist or a counselor, or choose a more public place to talk to him.You cannot control how well or how not well your husband takes the news. But if there is a history of violence or abuse in your marriage, make sure you have another person in the room with you. You can also tell your husband over the phone if you are concerned about your safety and do not want to be in his presence when you tell him the news.  Treat the conversation with all the gentleness you would use if you were telling him a loved one had died. Be direct, but also compassionate.Being respectful during the conversation will also make it easier to talk about other logistical things like shared custody of the children, if there are any, and the division of your financial assets.  Do not try to assume how your husband is feeling about your marriage. Instead, report on the state of your own feelings and avoid placing any blame or shame on your husband.For example: “I know this may be hard to hear, but I believe our marriage is over and I would like a divorce.” Or, “We have both tried but it’s not working between us and I do not believe that any more counseling or therapy will help. I think the marriage is over and that we have to divorce.”  , Even if your husband may be aware there are issues in your marriage, he will likely be upset when you tell him you want a divorce. But it’s important that you do not retaliate, try to defend yourself, or try to justify your decision.For example, he may respond to you with: “This is just another example of you trying to run away from responsibility. You are so selfish and only think about yourself. I have given you everything I have. I’ve tried so hard to make this family and this home. I don’t deserve this and the kids don’t deserve this.” Avoid a response like: “Don’t lecture me. I’m leaving because I’m sick and tired of your childish crap. I’m sick of living in this house and I’m sick of living without sex or affection. I’ve tried to make this marriage work and you block me out whenever I ask you to change.” This response may feel good for about two minutes but will ultimately lead to a bitter fight. Instead, respond with: “I know this is very painful and I am so sorry I am doing this. But I just can’t see an alternative. I don’t have the feelings that we would need to make it work. There is too much distance between us to overcome.” This response is better because it is not defensive or angry. You are showing your husband that you feel your decision is correct and it is not coming from a place of self defense. You are also showing your husband that you are aware that any anger or defensiveness from you will only create more anger and hurt between the both of you.  Once his initial anger simmers down, your husband may try to negotiate with you on the terms of the separation. He may ask for a trial separation, where you both are separated but legally still married. Or he may ask you if you can both try therapy or counseling again. You should be prepared for these types of questions, especially if your husband will be devastated by your wish for a divorce.If you are serious about the divorce, be firm about your decision. Tell your husband: “I don’t think a trial separation is the answer. We have tried to fix our marriage and I don’t think, at this point, it is going to work.”  , The initial talk with your husband will likely be emotionally charged. So don’t rush into hashing out the details of the divorce when your first tell your husband of your desire to separate.Reassure him that you are willing to work with him to achieve a fair and civil separation and to work with an attorney to find the best arrangement for the both of you.  Although you are both now anxious about the future and the details of the divorce, assure your husband that he can take some time to think about what you have discussed.Acknowledge that the divorce will create some big changes for the both of you. Then, let him know you are going to be staying with a family member or friend for a few days. Or that you would like him to stay somewhere else so he can process the information. For example: “Thank you for listening to my thoughts, I really appreciate it. I know this is a lot to process. So take your time and think about what I have said.”  , It's a good idea to determine if you are going to be staying in the home or if you are going to move out. Coming to an agreement about the living arrangements will help you both to adjust to this big change. Remind your husband that the living arrangements are temporary until the divorce is finalized.  If you and your husband have children, you will both need to agree on the best time and place to break the news. You should both sit your children down together, after dinner in a common area like the living room or the dining room, and explain the details of the divorce.Tell the truth. Your kids are entitled to know why you are getting a divorce, but very detailed reasons may only confuse them. Pick something simple and honest, like “We can’t get along anymore.” You may need to remind your children that while sometimes parents and kids don't always get along, parents and kids don't stop loving each other or get divorced from each other. In general, younger children need less detail, while older children may need more details about the divorce. Say “I love you.” However simple it may sound, letting your children know that your love for them hasn’t changed is a powerful message. Tell them you’ll still be caring for them in every way, from fixing their breakfast to helping with homework, and that you will both always be there for them. Address changes. Preempt your kids’ questions about changes in their lives by acknowledging that some things will be different now, and other things won’t. Let them know that together you can deal with each detail as you go. Avoid blame. Try not to be critical of your husband or his actions. Agree in advance to show a unified front and tell your children the same reasons for the divorce. Explain the temporary living situation with your children and when the divorce will be finalized.  Though it may be tempting to console your husband by showing physical affection toward him, it’s important to maintain your distance and not fall back into the habits of your marriage. You want to avoid sending him mixed signals or hurting him further by staying emotionally or physically involved with him. Demonstrate how serious you are about the divorce by keeping your distance., Don't be afraid to do this if your husband threatens he will take the children from you. In fact, a judge will likely be more sympathetic towards you if you remove your children from a potentially dangerous situation with your husband.You want to also give your controlling husband as little power as possible, and this means taking the children away from his control. You may need to ask for help from a friend to leave the family home and get away from your husband.  If you are trying to divorce an abusive husband, it's important to have a plan in place to protect yourself and your children, if you have any. A restraining order can give you a legal way to create distance between you and your husband. You may want to get the restraining order before you tell your husband you want a divorce or once you and your children are in a safe place, away from your spouse.The most dangerous time for an abused woman is the first 24 hours after a restraining order has been issued. If you feel unsafe and decide to get a restraining order, ask the police if they can drive by your house. You can also contact your local shelter to see if you can stay in a safe house until things are settled.  It is much easier to have a collaborative approach to the divorce. It’s also less expensive if you and your husband are able to settle your issues without legal involvement.If it is not possible to keep a lawyer out of it, make sure you hire an attorney that is willing to litigate your case before a judge. The attorney should know the value of settling the divorce quickly, but he should also be willing to fight for you in court should the need arise. Interview at least three attorneys before you decide on one. Look for a divorce attorney who has at least 5-10 years experience practicing family and divorce law.  You need a clear picture of where you and your spouse stand financially. One of the main goals of a divorce is to have an equitable distribution of marital assets and debts. To get your fair share, you need to know what is owned by you and your husband and what is owed by you and your husband. To do this:Make a list of all possible assets that you own or partly own. Some shared marital assets are obvious. The marital home and any financial accounts and vehicles are assets that should be split equitably. Other assets might include artwork, pension plans, inheritances, or belongings brought into the marriage. Gather all documentation for each asset, including present value, when and where the asset was purchased, and whether it was purchased with joint or separate funds. Turn over all documentation to your attorney and keep a copy for yourself. Determine the debt in your marriage. When determining what you owe, it doesn’t matter whose name any debts are in. Marital debt will be split based on who is more financially able to pay the debt, not by whose name the debt is in. The easiest way to determine marital debt is to get a copy of your credit report. Turn this information over to your attorney as well. Determine your income. If you and your husband are salaried employees, give your attorney a copy of your most recent pay stubs and your most recent Income Tax Return.  It’s important that you figure out how you are going to live once you are divorced.Think about your living costs, and how much income you will have after the divorce. Some women experience a major drop income post divorce. So avoid getting dinged with bills you can’t pay by creating a budget for yourself. Figuring out your expenses post-divorce will also influence how you negotiate your divorce settlement. Your attorney can use this information to determine your settlement options or what you may ask for if your case goes to court.  

consider your reasons for the divorce.  try not to blindside your husband.  practice what you are going to say.  find a private, quiet space.  have a third party in the room if you are worried about your safety.  be calm, kind, and direct.  focus on neutral language and “i” statements.  be prepared for an angry response.  address the possibility of a trial separation.  avoid discussing the details of the divorce right away.  give your husband time to process the information.  decide on your living arrangements.  discuss breaking the news to the children, if any.  keep your distance.  take your children with you if you are dealing with an abusive husband.  get a restraining order if you are concerned about your safety.  get an attorney.  gather your financial information.  prepare a post-divorce budget. 

 Being consistent means that the expectations and rules that are set should be the same from day to day, and place to place. Consistency gives a child a sense of well-being, safety, and security. It teaches a child accountability for their actions, and helps provide a safe boundary for exploration.   If you're inconsistent, you're giving a child the information that their needs are not important to you. Having regular daily routines at home will help provide a better sense of security for your child. If these routines are based in your child's needs, they'll better understand that they are valued.  It helps to get into a routine (for example, taking a half hour walk every day after your child comes home from school). This can help ensure that you spend time with them. Set aside blocks of time where you can be with your child.   If you're really busy one day and don't spend much time with them, make up for it by spending more time with them on a later day.  Modeling self-care for a child is an important aspect of teaching a child what it means to be valued. Taking care of your health, hygiene, psychological and emotional needs are all part of what it means to care for your own well-being.   Don't remain in situations where you're abused, neglected or mistreated. Take time for yourself when you need it. You don't have to be constantly available at the whims of your child. If you really need some quiet time, say so, and set up the child with something they can do independently. If you need help understanding more about self-care, ask for help from a friend or professional.  For a child to feel valued, they must also feel safe. Safety comes from adults having good, healthy boundaries. The adult is responsible for providing structure and support.This doesn't mean that you can't have fun with your child. However, you must be prepared to interrupt a fun game in order to ensure that the child's safety needs are met. Consider your child's individual personality. Some children need more structure to feel safe than other children. It's important to meet the needs of your particular child.  If your child is upset, respond with empathy and patience, not judgment. Ask what's wrong, and work together on brainstorming ways to make things better.   Be gentle and firm about rules. For example, "I know you want the purple car. The rule we set is that you can pick out one toy, and you already chose the pink car. It's your choice which car you get." You can empathize with the child while still expecting them to adhere to the rules.  Let your child know that even if their behavior is unacceptable in a given situation, you still care about and love them no matter what. Everyone makes mistakes, wrong decisions, and errors in judgment. If your child is learning that they're valued, they'll be learning to make this distinction as well.Reminding them that they will have other opportunities to make better choices is one way of encouraging them to learn. If your child repeatedly engages in the same negative behavior, consider what response you are providing. If you tend to engage more frequently with your child regarding negative behaviors, they may be acting out in search of your attention.  

be consistent.  try to spend quality time with your child every day.  show that you value your own well-being.  set appropriate rules and boundaries.  be there for them when they're struggling.  focus on negative behavior, rather than saying the child is bad. 

 Purchase clay bead piercing pins from any manufacturer that produces tools for working with clay.If you are unable to find bead piercing pins, sharp skewers or large sewing pins might work well enough. The instrument you use simply needs a sharp, pointed tip and a sturdy metal shaft similar in thickness to 20 gauge wire. It also needs to be long enough to completely pierce through at least one bead.  Lightly grasp the bead in between your fingers using your non-dominant hand. Using your dominant hand, gently push the sharp pin tip into the spot the hole needs to be at.   Your fingers should be positioned on the smooth side of the bead and clear from the entrance or exit point of the desired hole. Hold the bead just lightly enough to keep it steady, but do not squeeze it.  Twirl the piercing pin between your fingers as you push it through the entire bead. Continue twisting and pushing until the pin pokes out from the opposite side.   You may also need to twist the bead lightly as you insert the pin. Keep the pin straight as you push it through. Work slowly and gently to minimize possible distortion to the shape of the bead.  After pushing the pin all the way through to the other side of the bead, pull it back into the hole by about 0.4 to 0.8 inches (1 to 2 mm)   As you push the pin through the bead, a little speck of clay will usually poke out from the opposite side. By pulling the pin back in, you can pull this speck back and prevent it from hardening onto the outer surface of the bead.  Mild distortion is fairly common, so you might need to use your fingers to gently reshape the bead before setting it.   With the right piercing pin and the right technique, you may not encounter any distortion at all. It can take practice before getting the process right without misshaping the bead at all, though, so you should expect a little difficulty the first time you try it.  Place the skewered beads on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or wax paper and bake them as you would bake any polymer clay piece.   Check the instructions on your polymer clay label to determine the correct temperature and correct amount of time. In most cases, you will need to bake the clay beads for 15 to 20 minutes in an oven preheated to 275 degrees Fahrenheit (135 degrees Celsius). Most pins should be oven-safe, so you shouldn't need to remove them prior to baking. Check periodically during the baking process to make sure that the pin is not melting or smoking, though.  Remove the finished clay beads from the oven and wait a few minutes for them to cool slightly. As soon as they are cool enough to touch, pick up each bead and pull the pin out through the entrance of the hole.   It is best to remove the pin while the clay is still somewhat warm and soft. Check the hole after you remove the pin. It should be clear and complete from side to side. Once you finish this step, the process is complete.  

select piercing pins.  push the pin into the bead.  twist and continue pushing.  pull the pin back.  reshape the bead as needed.  bake the clay.  remove the pin and check the hole. 

 Algebraic chess notation is used to explain the moves.; , Moving the King pawn two spaces forward is the most common move played in professional and amateur chess.

 Before you apply for the permit, you need to gather together all of the paperwork that you need. To apply you need your full US driving license - unless, you don't live in American then, well, work it out, two passport photos, as well as a check covering the cost of the application. The cost of the application should not be more than $20.   The two associations authorised by the US Department of State to process International Driving Permits are the American Automobile Association, and the National Auto Club.If another company is offering to process your claim, it will most likely be more expensive so go directly to one of the officially authorised associations.; , You can apply for an International Driving Permit through the post. Print out a copy of the application form from the website of the American Automobile Association or the National Auto Club and fill in all of your details. You will need to provide all of your address details as well as your driving license details.To apply by post you will need to include a signed photocopy of both sides of your driving license, along with a check for the required amount. You will also need to send the two passport photographs with the completed application form., If you prefer, you can apply for the permit in person. The requirements are the same, you just have to go into the local office of one of the two issuing associations and present them with your license, the fee, as well as the two passport photographs required for the permit., Once your application has been processed, it is just a matter of waiting for it to arrive. It's best to submit the application well in advance of your trip abroad. If you have left it late, it is possible to pay extra for a priority service.Once you have received the permit, you should keep it with your US driver's license at all times.   The International Driving Permit does is not valid for driving in the US so don't think you only need to carry the international permit around with you at home., If you are planning on driving while you are abroad you need to determine if an International Driving Permit is required well before you intend to travel. Many countries will require you to have this permit to drive there. The application process is relatively straight-forward so if you are in any doubt, be sure you get yourself a permit.   You can access a list of countries which accept the permit online. Look on the website of the US Embassy of the country you want to drive in if you are uncertain. If you plan to rent a car, contact rental firms in advance to check the requirements. The permit essentially demonstrates that you are a licensed driver and translates this information into ten languages. Your national driving license might appear alien and indecipherable to a police officer abroad, so having this permit can help with communication., In order to be eligible to apply for an International Driving Permit, you need to have a full US driving license, and be at least 18 years of age. You will need to present your license when you apply for the International Driving Permit, so be sure you have it to hand before you go any further.Your US driving license must be valid six months before the date on which the International Driving Permit is issued., If you are planning on driving abroad you should be certain that you have taken care of any insurance you might require. If you are planning on hiring a car, the insurance costs will be included in the rental agreement. If you are taking your own car, be sure to check you are covered to drive abroad as part of your policy. Most often, you will not be.   If your auto insurance policy does cover you to drive abroad, you may still need to buy more cover to reach the minimum level required by your destination country.If you are uncertain, call up your insurance agency to check your policy and get any extra cover that might be required.  Before you travel it is always a good idea to look up the local rules and regulations for the road. You should seek to gain a good understanding of laws and driving practices before you get behind the wheel in another country. For example, some countries have on-the-spot fines for drivers caught not wearing a seatbelt or using a cell phone.Some countries may have toll roads, or require permits to use certain roads so check this before you go. If you are going to be driving on the left-hand side for the first time, try practising on a quieter stretch of road before heading into a big city. Tourism offices, car rental firms, and government embassy's or consulates are good places to look for information on local driving laws. 

gather the information and paperwork you need.  apply by mail.  apply in person.  keep your us license and international permit together.  discover when you need an international driving permit.  be over 18 years old with a full us license.  ensure you have necessary insurance to drive abroad.  check the specific rules for your destination. 

 To combat the blue and gray color under your eyes, choose an orange or peach colored concealer. Orange is the complementary color to blue, which means when orange is applied to a blue area, the colors "cancel" one another out.Pick a color that is only one or two shades darker than your skin – otherwise, the concealer will be visible against the normal color of your skin. Concealers come in liquid, powder, and stick form.   Liquid concealers are good for light coverage, while sticks are great for smaller or narrower areas. Any type of concealer will work, though remember that liquid makeup may appear glossy, whereas powder makeup can give a matte appearance. Choose a makeup based on your skin type – oily skin is more likely to be “shiny” with certain liquid makeup, for example.; , Apply an eye cream to both eyes to make sure your under-eye area is well-moisturized. If there's any hint of dryness, the concealer will turn chalky and become very noticeable to others.          Try keeping the eye cream in the fridge prior to application. The cold temperature of the cream contracts the skin, allowing for a tighter appearance.If you wear foundation, put it on before applying concealer. However, any powder-based makeup, including foundation should, go on last, after the concealer., Use either a small nylon concealer brush, sponge, or your fingers to apply concealer below the shadows of your eye bags. Dab the concealer on to provide an even, blended coverage, without smearing. You want to apply just below the crease of your bags and blend downward, toward your cheek bones, in a triangular fashion.Aim for the top of your cheeks, just below the bags and shadows.          Don’t apply makeup directly to the puffiness! The area under your eyes will wrinkle under heavy makeup, causing the bags to stand out even more. Applying the concealer below the bags draws attention to that area, instead of your puffy eyes.When it comes to concealer, less is more – too much can give a “caked” appearance. If you use powder foundation, remember to apply the concealer before applying the foundation.  Take a moment to let the concealer set. If there's still darkness under your eye, you may add a bit more concealer, but keep it light. If the concealer is too bright, you will need to blend the makeup out.          If the concealer is too dark, balance it out with a concealer that is one shade lighter than your skin tone. This will help highlight the area below the puffiness., Use a concealer or foundation of your natural skin tone to blend the previous application of concealer with the rest of your skin. This helps create a more natural appearance and remove a “caked” or overly-bright look.         Patting the concealer rather than rubbing help avoid smearing the makeup, and creates a more even blend. If using your fingers to blend the concealer, use your ring finger. The ring finger tends to be the weakest finger, and provides a gentler touch., Use a pale, pink colored highlighter to add some color to the inner and outer corners of your eyes. This helps draw attention to your eyes, and away from the bags and shadows.         Avoid eye liner or shadow in darker colors. Such colors can draw attention back to the bags you’re trying to hide. Don't forget the inner area of the eye, near the bridge of the nose. Adding just a small amount of concealer or highlighter here can help brighten your whole face., Use a face powder to set the makeup on your face, keeping it locked in and looking good all day. Take care to apply just a thin layer to avoid too much buildup of makeup.          No need to apply powder to your entire face. Just lightly dab the powder in the areas where you have applied makeup. You can opt to use a bit more powder in areas prone to shininess – powder provides a matte look., The bags under our eyes are caused by fluid retention. Overconsumption of salt leads to this retention, meaning cutting back on the amount of salt in your food can help reduce the puffiness in your eyes.Lay off the foods that are high in sodium, such as pickles, olives, soup, and fast food. Eat more foods that are high in potassium, such as bananas, avocados, and celery. These foods help balance the sodium in your body., The body holds on to water when you are dehydrated, leading to fluid retention. Upping your water intake can reduce this retention, reducing the bags under your eyes. Aim for eight glasses of water a day (8 ounces each) to keep a healthy hydration level.   Water is gained through food as well. Try upping the amount of fruit and vegetables you eat to supplement your water intake., A lack of good rest causes fluid retention and dark shadows under our eyes. Make sure you get between 7 and 9 hours of sleep per night, depending on your individual needs.   Though a lack of sleep contributes to eye bags, sleeping more is not necessarily a cure. If you already get plenty of sleep and still have eye bags, forcing yourself to sleep more will not reduce the puffiness., Leaving face and eye makeup on at night can clog pores, cause acne, and generally prevent your skin from restoring itself overnight. Make sure to wipe off any makeup prior to sleeping for the night to reduce damage to the eyes.   Use a moisturizing eye cream overnight to help remove wrinkles and lines associated with puffy bags., Seasonal allergies and sinus problems cause swelling, which can lead to those pesky eye bags and shadows. Talk to your doctor to discuss your allergies and see if there is a treatment option that can help combat the problem.   Over-the-counter decongestant or neti pots can help keep things moving in your sinuses, without the need for a prescription. Stay hydrated! Water will keep those dark circles from appearing, but also keeps your nasal passages and sinuses well lubricated. 

choose your concealer.  prepare your skin.  apply the concealer.  assess the application.  pat under the eyes to blend.  brighten around your eyes.  set the makeup.  cut back on salty foods.  drink more water.  get enough sleep.  remove your makeup at night.  get your allergies in check. 

 Everyone has personal limits. There may be behaviors and actions that make you feel uncomfortable, disrespected, or otherwise negative. Before trying to establish healthy boundaries, identify where your limits are. What are you willing to do for your boyfriend and what is too much?Think about times you've felt taken advantage of by your boyfriend. What behaviors led to these feelings? For example, maybe your boyfriend borrows money from you a lot and this makes you feel uncomfortable. Remember, your feelings are valid. Everyone has limits, so do not feel bad for yours. For example, maybe you do make more money than your boyfriend and can afford to lend him money; however, this does not mean this is required of you, especially if you don't like the tension money creates in a relationship.  Just because you are able to do something does not mean you have to do it. Before setting boundaries, recognize you are entitled to them. Everyone has a right to set up personal boundaries in a relationship to feel safe and respected. Remind yourself of this before talking over boundaries with your boyfriend. Do not go into the conversation feeling guilty for requesting boundaries., It's important your boyfriend or guyfriend understand your boundaries on no uncertain terms. Boundaries are an important personal right, so make yourself as clear and direct as possible when discussing your own personal boundaries.For example, do not say, "I guess I just get a little uncomfortable lending you money a lot. Sorry, but I just worry it could create tension, so maybe you could borrow from someone else sometimes?" Instead, state yourself clearly. Set concrete limits that your boyfriend can clearly understand. For example, "I don't want to lend you money anymore. I feel money can create tension in a relationship and I worry about resentment building if this becomes a habit. Please do not ask me for money anymore."  , Sometimes, people will not understand your boundaries right away. Your boyfriend may violate your boundaries in the future, even after you've made yourself clear. In this case, be assertive and restate your boundaries again.Let your boyfriend or guyfriend know when they've crossed a line. Remind them you have already told them about your boundaries and they need to respect them. For example, your boyfriend asks to borrow money for groceries after you've explained that you're not lending him money anymore. Calmly say something like, "We talked about this, remember? I don't feel comfortable lending you money all the time. I can't help you."  , Once you've stated boundaries, some personal reflection can be helpful. You want to make sure your relationships are healthy and reciprocal. Some people have a history of letting others violate their boundaries, so think about your own personal history to make sure you know how to prioritize yourself.Think about the types of relationships you've had in the past. Are you prone to friendships and romantic relationships that feel one-sided? If so, you may need to work no prioritizing your feelings a little more. Consider your role in your family growing up. Were you frequently in caregiver roles? If so, you may sometime forget to practice self care. If you continue to struggle to prioritize yourself, it may be helpful to work with a therapist or counselor.  

evaluate your limits and feelings.  recognize your right to healthy boundaries.  be direct during the conversation.  be assertive.  reflect on your past and present. 

 Do this before you begin. Tell your friends about the pledge, too, and suggest that they become involved.  There is a wealth of reputable information about recycling available online, suitable for kids to adults. Do a little research and spend some time learning about what can and cannot be recycled (and why), where recycling occurs in the world, and the items that recycled products end up as.  The US EPA has an excellent collection of recycling publications. CalRecycle has lots of freely available publications on waste and recycling at: http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/Publications/. Many of the industries involved in manufacturing products that can be recycled will also have recycling information on their websites. Look especially for manufacturers of metals, paper, glass, plastic, batteries, and steel. Look for posters, books, games, calculators, and quizzes as well as reading material at online sites. There are many fun, interactive ways to learn about recycling.  You can register the event with America Recycles Day and let them know what you're doing. There are lots of amazing things you can do to get into the recycling spirit, including:  Have a garage sale or yard sale, arrange a community swap meet, ask offices to give away their unwanted furniture to people who can use it, hold a garden tools swap meet, go shopping at a thrift store, exchange unwanted household goods and clothing, etc. Make crafts from recycled items, sell recycled crafts and artwork, decorate and improve old clothes and shoes, make bird feeders from old items, make this year's Christmas cards from last year's cards, etc. Collect and donate items such as eyeglasses, clothes, costumes, stationery, computers, fire extinguishers, ink cartridges, construction materials, etc. Hold a recycled art and craft exhibition. Encourage all local residents to enter something they've made from recycled items. Award recycled prizes for the best entries and try to get the media interested so that the winners get their names in the paper or online.  The easiest way to get an answer would be either at your town/city hall or at a local recycling center. Have plenty of time available should you need to wait. Write down any questions you have beforehand to avoid any forgetfulness. Be sure to write down a quick answer, too. Ask about when you can drop off recyclables and what kind of recyclables your center takes.  If you're unhappy with the extent of recycling offered in your area after you've received your information, why not follow it up with letters to your local authority making suggestions on possible improvements. Some suggestions might include asking the local authority to collect more kinds of recyclables, to provide better recycling facilities and bins, to encourage their own staff to collect recyclables at work, to compost and mulch garden waste and Christmas trees, to run programs that show people how to compost, etc.  Collect items such as newspapers, soda cans, bottles, and whatever else your recycling center allows. Don't just save up your own. Get your friends, family, and neighbors involved! You can even offer rewards, if you so choose.  Recycle the items you've collected. Whether you have recycled a bottle or 200 bottles, you will have made a difference in the environment. Learn how you can recycle batteries, cell phones, and other electronic things legally. Most town recycle centers have special requirements for these kinds of items, so should you get one from a recycle drive, inquire about the item before dropping it off. Download a widget that lets you know whether or not an item can be recycled. America Recycles Day provides a free widget for download that takes the guesswork out of it for you.  If family members and friends aren't yet convinced of the value of recycling, pointing out its benefits can help to improve their attitude toward it. For example, recycling not only clears the clutter out of your life but it helps to protect the environment by reusing resources rather than always seeking new resources, it provides jobs for people in the recycling industry, and on the fun side, recycling can burn calories as you sort the items and toss them into bins!  Recycled craft has become more and more popular in recent years and can be a fun way to express your creativity without having to spend too much money on materials. For more ideas on crafts with recyclable items, read How to make recycled crafts. If you have Microsoft Excel, download the US EPA's iWarm tool to calculate how much your current recycling reduces your carbon footprint. It's available at: http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/tools/iwarm/.  about increasing the amount of money to promote and sustain recycling. Unfortunately, most states don't provide enough money for adequate recycling centers. You can help by asking the right people to increase funding and give a sound list of reasons as to why this is a good idea (including benefits to the community as a whole), and some suggestion on how you think it could be done, if you have any.  Type your letters for a more professional appearance. If you're shy about writing to your governor, try writing to your town manager or mayor. Attend your local town meetings soon after you've sent your letter, or at least try to find a response to it televised.  Just because one day out of 365 is dedicated to recycling doesn't mean that's the only day for recycling. Make recycling the norm in your household; and if you're already well into the habit, think of ways you can crank it up some more and reduce the garbage, and increase the recyclables. Also think of ways that you can reduce the amount of disposable items you bring into your home in the first place.  Buy canvas hampers to sort cans, bottles, etc. and get in the habit of bringing your full hampers to the recycling center as needed. Take bags to the supermarket instead of accepting plastic bags. For bulk store purchases, take along your own reusable containers (well cleaned). Read How to ask a store to sell you items in your own containers for some more ideas.  

   take the pledge to recycle on the official america recycles day (ard) website.  learn more about recycling.  consider hosting a recycling event in your area.  find out what your own town's policy on recycling is.  collect recyclables.  tell everyone you know that recycling is useful and fun.  write to your local government (senators, governors, etc.),  make it a habit to recycle things.

 You should mix your ingredients using a wooden spoon. Stir the ingredients together until they're more or less evenly combined.Keep a spatula on-hand. Some ingredients, like cream cheese, are sticky and may need to be scraped off the side of the bowl periodically.  Place your mixture in a 6-quart slow cooker. Make sure to mist the slow cooker with a no-stick spray before adding the ingredients.Cook the mixture on low heat. It should cook for about 2 hours. However, if it's not warmed completely after this time passes, cook it for a little longer.  Stir the dip again after it's cooked. Add a little salt and pepper to taste. Place the dip in a serving dish and serve it with crackers or pita bread. 

mix all your ingredients in a large mixing bowl.  cook the mixture in your slow cooker.  stir your dip and serve. 

 Many pest control products have brochures or instruction pamphlets enclosed or attached to their container. Here are a few examples of the product instructions:   Mix 1 oz. of product per 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. This is a mix ratio. Using stronger concentrations does not make the product more effective, but can increase its toxicity. Do not use in windy conditions. Windy conditions may cause the product to drift into unprotected areas, or into a waterway where contamination and unintentional aquatic life kill is possible. Do not mix with other products. Mixing pesticides, or any chemical, may produce unexpected and dangerous results.; , The warning label contains specific information about the product. Some obvious information may include the following.   Its toxicity level.  "CAUTION" means that it is mildly toxic. Lethal dose is an ounce or more. "WARNING" means that it is moderately toxic. Lethal dose is between a teaspoon and tablespoon, "DANGER" means that it is highly toxic. Lethal dose is trace amounts.   Avoid fumes, use in well ventilated area. Liquid pesticides may produce poisonous fumes when the container is opened, or while the product is being mixed and applied. Avoid contact with skin. Many chemical products may be absorbed through skin. Avoid sparks or open flame. Pesticides are often suspensions in petroleum distillate solvents, which can be highly flammable.    Never use food preparation utensils for this purpose. Even if you only intend to use a measuring cup for your pesticide, it could accidentally be picked up and taken into the kitchen later. Mix your pesticide in the application equipment if possible, to avoid handling it during use. Commonly, compressed air or pump up garden sprayers are used for this purpose. In agriculture, tractor mounted, PTO driven equipment is used to apply pesticides on crops and farm land.  This can be accomplished by reading the information on the label under "application rate", generally in terms of gallons per acre, or 'gallons per 1000 square foot". Measure the area you intend to treat, and calculate the amount of material required to treat it. Storing left over mixed pesticides is generally not a good idea, but if you must, label the container according to contents and date mixed, and keep it tightly closed.  Use copious amounts of water, and do not allow run off from washing to go into waterways. Keep the washing operation away from wells or other drinking water supplies.  This is usually listed on the warning and usage label for each specific product, and the following are some common items.   Safety glasses. These keep chemicals or dust from getting in the applicator's eyes. Rubber gloves. Rubber, neoprene, or other chemical resistant gloves protect your hands from chemicals which may be absorbed through your skin. Long sleeved shirts and long pants. Another barrier protection for your skin. When the application process is complete, remove clothing and rinse it thoroughly before laundering. Rubber boots. Because leather or cloth boots can absorb and accumulate chemicals, it is often suggested that the person applying pesticides wear rubber boots. , If you are using a liquid spray, no one should reenter the area until the product is completely dry.  Use only products specifically labelled for this purpose, and remove any loose items such as clothing, books, and toys prior to applying.  Chemicals undergo changes over a period of time, and pesticides may become unstable, more toxic, or ineffective after the expiration date listed on the package.  If insects return before the reapplication date, you will need to find a different control method. Most pesticides recommend treating (or retreating) a crop or area at specific intervals, often coinciding in the development rate of insects from egg or larval stage to adult. Overuse can create chemical resistance in the target insect and toxic levels of chemical buildup in the soil, plants, and environment the pesticide is used on. , For use on edible crops, carefully follow the label instructions in regard to the period prior to harvest that pesticides may be applied, since simply washing the product will not remove the poison.  This will ultimately give better control of insects and decrease the frequency of application.  This contributes to safety by decreasing the use of poisons altogether. Planting certain flowers like marigolds, and herbs like garlic will naturally decrease the insect populations in your crop. Bacillus thuringiensis or "BT", is a bacterium compound which attacks certain insects when topically applied to plants, while being harmless to humans and animals.  

read and follow all label instructions.  read the warning label.  use only appropriate containers for measuring, mixing, and applying pesticides.  mix only the amount of the product you intend to use.  wash all equipment after each use.  use appropriate safety equipment.  never smoke, drink, or eat while applying pesticides.  ,  keep people and animals out of areas treated with insecticides and other chemicals for the period recommended on the product label.  be extremely careful applying pesticides in buildings or homes.  do not use pesticides after any expiration dates on the package.  use pesticides only at the intervals recommended by the manufacturer.  apply pesticides in the early morning or late evening to avoid excessive drift (wind is normally lower during these time periods), and to prevent exposing beneficial insects like bees and ladybugs to the effects of them.  ,  be aware that certain pesticides are systemically active, meaning the chemical is absorbed by the plant tissues and distributed throughout the plant.  alternate suitable pesticides to obtain the best results in pest control.  always look for the most environmentally sound, and least toxic pest control method. 

 If your period tends to be very heavy and you're not yet on birth control, talk to your doctor about your options. Both birth control pills and intrauterine devices (IUDs) can make your periods lighter and reduce cramps.You may also want to talk to your doctor about whether prescriptions pain pills, anti-inflammatory drugs, antidepressants, and/or antibiotics could help with your heavy periods.; , Several kinds of birth control — including birth control pills, the patch, and Depo-Provera — allow you to skip your period. If you’re able to plan ahead, consider eliminating the problem entirely.You may also have to deal with breakthrough bleeding, which — because it can come at any time — can be almost as annoying as your actual period. There is another possibility, though it is important to note it is not a contraceptive — tranexamic acid is a pill that can be prescribed to lighten menses. Discuss this option with your doctor, and how to use the pills if heavy bleeding should occur while you are on vacation. Be certain to use a form of birth control in addition to this pill if you are sexually active; again, it will not prevent pregnancy or STDs.  Even if you’re not scheduled to get your period, consider bringing some supplies. Travel can disrupt your cycle, even if your period is usually super regular, and you don’t want to be caught off guard.By that same token, don’t necessarily start to panic if you are late or even miss a period while traveling. This can be caused by stress, changes in eating or exercising, jet lag, or some combination thereof., Menstrual cups take up less room in your bag, are environmentally friendly, and can be left in for up to twelve hours. Try them out the month before you go to make sure you are comfortable with the process.Conserving space is especially important if you tend to bleed heavily. In addition to painkillers, pads, tampons, or menstrual cups, you might want to see if you can squeeze in a heating pad, vitamin B6, calcium, and magnesium, and iron supplements if you are anemic. 

look into different kinds of birth control.  consider skipping your period entirely.  be prepared for surprises.  consider more travel-friendly supplies. 

 There needs to be enough radiant heat to be able to cook the toppings. Otherwise, you will only be cooking the crust from below.          Does your barbecue have a lid and thermostat? Can it reach and maintain a temperature of around 220ºC/428ºF? If not, there is still a simple way to work around this, as explained in the next step. Does your barbecue have a large, flat hot-plate? You can use a slotted grill, but this does make the process far more likely to be a mess.; , A little preparation makes for much more even heat and a better pizza.          The big issue/virtue with barbecues is the smoke factor that gives that smoky flavour to food. If the barbecue is not clean it will smoke the food too much and your pizza will not taste of anything aside from smoke. Its best to clean the plate before and after use as well as allowing a long enough preheat time to burn off any debris. As per the warnings below, with residences becoming closer, or similarly if you live in an apartment, it is best to consider your neighbours and ensure that the wind factor is favourable to blow any smoke away from homes (especially clothes-lines). As many restaurants now serve a form of grilled pizza, it would be better to frequent these places instead of becoming the local enemy if you don't have space to BBQ. Use bricks to retain the right level of heat. Place bricks (free of any dirt that could burn, wrapped in foil if you wish) around the barbecue to simulate a baker's oven and preheat the barbecue until it reaches temperature. It will take more time to preheat adequately using bricks, but the heat will be more even and appropriate for cooking pizza. If your barbecue has no flat plate (having only slotted or bar grills), cook the pizza on a heavy cast iron skillet, a pizza stone, or other heavy-duty and flame-proof flat piece of cookware. If you have no lid, improvise one using an upturned roasting pan (which likewise must be preheated), which will radiate heat. Place the pizza under the roasting pan. Practice utmost care with this method, to avoid burns. For wood-fired barbecues or fire pits, try making a fixed frame surround out of bricks and using a hot roasting pan filled with hot coals.  This fixed structure should consist of placing one or two brick courses high, making two sides and a back, and leaving the front and top spaces open. The distance between the two side walls should be small enough that the roasting pan will sit firmly and safely on top. Then place the pizza into the space inside the "walls" and place the roasting pan on top to radiate heat down onto the pizza. (Only do this with a fixed setup; do not attempt to do this with loose bricks). Remove the roasting pan when the pizza is cooked to access the pizza, or if it is browning too quickly on top.  Most barbecue pizzas have thinner crusts and have very few raw ingredients because they cook from the base up. A barbecue with really good heat control can allow more variations to crust thickness and structure; you'll need to experiment to learn what works best with your own barbecue.          Using wholemeal flours or fine cornmeal makes a more protein-rich and chewier dough, but it also takes longer to cook through. You can precook or pre-grill the base in advance and then freeze it. The bases do freeze very well, so try making a batch of them at a time. A pre-cooked crust may not taste quite as good as one cooked from scratch, but it will save a lot of trouble. When the crust is almost cooked through, add cooked toppings and bake long enough to warm them through and melt the cheese.  Or keep it simple but still delicious – some barbecued pizzas are little more than the bread dough cooked briefly on both sides like a pancake, then brushed with an herb and garlic oil and eaten as is or wrapped around other foods, and they're still delicious.          Precook any meat, especially seafood and chicken. You don't want it to come out too rare. It is best to place meat closer to the edges of the pizza to cook it faster.  You can also improvise with a wooden chopping board, baking sheet or other flat item to allow the smooth transfer of pizza onto the barbecue plate. Should you be using a dough and not a precooked base, try not to allow the dough to prove too much or it will go soft and will tear easily. Another "practice makes perfect" activity.  A barbecue is a very difficult thing to control heat-wise, so regular checking is essential to avoid burning.  If there are various people sitting around, ask for several helpers to keep tending the pizza cooking so that you can share the duties and enjoy the eating when your own pizza is ready.         

evaluate your barbecue.  prepare and preheat the grill.  start with a fairly thin crust.  slice the toppings thinly and choose flavorful toppings.  place your pizza onto a peel.  watch your pizza cook.  remove the pizza once cooked to your satisfaction and serve without delay. 

 You only have to be level 2, then she'll tell you about this cave.   Her followers protecting her shrine were turned into vampires and she wants you to end their misery.  Get hit enough times and you'll contract Porphilica Hemophilia or "vampires disease". Wait a few days then you turn into a vampire.  This is good for capturing souls or just leave them there, not all at once; maybe only one or two at a time. 

talk to azura at her shrine.  go to the cave.  continue to finish the quest and get azura's star.  enjoy the glories of the darkness.  

 Use whole foods that require no stove (and for some, no fridge!), like fresh or dried fruits, nuts, seeds and long-lasting veggies like carrots, cabbage and peppers. Choose healthy options to spice up the veggies such as yogurt, hummus, salsa and dips. Other backpacker options include energy bars, granola bars, health food store cookies, bread, cans of beans and pre-made salads.   Eat fresh each day and replenish your larder on the way home from work or college, as part of your daily routine. Never over-supply your kitchen––just as a backpacker keeps moving to a new destination and can't be weighed down by too much food, be mindful of only having sufficient to eat for the next few days, always keeping your intake fresh. This approach works best for those in urban areas, or where it's easy to replenish your food supply direct from a garden or local supplier.; , Growing interest in the raw food movements and paleo diets has revealed just how far modern humans have divorced themselves from the healthy foods nature intended for us to eat. By eating more raw food or following a paleo style diet, you will reconnect with some very healthy choices as well as avoid cooking much of the time.   Do note that if you want to puree or blend nuts, seeds and fruits, for example, that there is some preparation involved. Be picky and choose the things that can be eaten fairly much in the state they were grown with little change required by you.  Many of us have neglected eating our greens to the detriment of our health. The health benefits of adding more fiber to your diet include lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol levels, improved insulin sensitivity, enhanced weight loss (in obese individuals) and enhanced immune function.You don't have to stick to the typical garden salad either. Try pizza salad, caprese salad and ambrosia fruit salad.  Try as many different kinds of good quality bread (not the sliced white stuff that has had all life processed out of it), meats, veggies, cheeses and condiments as you can think of. Try your favorite breads cold, toasted, open faced, warmed in the microwave or dipped into extra virgin olive oils.   Explore different ways of making sandwiches. Don't be afraid to try sweet fillings such as sliced fruit or spread lemon curd. See these sandwich suggestions for lots more sandwich ideas to inspire you.  Buy food or pre-made meals that you can put in the microwave to heat up, along with a good dose of fresh food such as an accompanying salad or some lightly steamed veggies. Be sure to read the labels though––many microwave meals are high in saturated or trans-fats, sugar, salt and artificial additives.   For better quality microwave meals and fresh items, try a local delicatessen, specialist bakery or gourmet foods store, where they make microwave meals and fresh salads, etc. for takeout.  They may invite you to their house for dinner together, especially if you're upfront about not enjoying cooking but loving other people's efforts!   Be sure to reciprocate as best you can. For example, offer to pay for ingredients or simply turn up with armfuls of healthy, fresh ingredients for their pantry and fridge. Shout your home-chef friends to a restaurant meal once in a while, to make up for all the homemade cooking you've enjoyed at their place. Visit more restaurants with friends to explore different flavors and cuisines. You will pay less for more variety if you go Dutch on pizza, Chinese, Indian food, and so forth. Try to make this a regular event, such as a once every two weeks, or once a month.  Many entree-sized meals from restaurants have two meals worth of food. However, don't live off takeout food, as commercially produced fast food tends to be a lot higher in trans- and saturated fats, salt, sugars and artificial flavorings and colorings. You don't need all those unhealthy, nutrition-deficient fillers in your body. Aim to eat healthier options, such as cheese-free veggie pizzas, Asian stir-fries, falafel plates and salads.   In some places, to-go means that there is no service gratuity (tips) required and this will save you money.  

eat like a backpacker.  eat raw or go paleo.  get creative with salads.  get creative with sandwiches.  use microwaveable foods and meals.  make friends with people who love to cook.  purchase food to-go. 

 They are purse friendly and you can fill them with your own choice of edible and non-edible treats. Take good care of them and your child could be giving them to their children. Plus, can you imagine how much card is thrown away every year for the sake of twenty-four clumps of sugary chocolate? See sources below for some lovely calendars.; , Get the Christmas CD out, roll your sleeves up and out that cupboard. If your house is full of old junk perhaps you'd better start earlier in the year and spread it out. Remember, if it's not useful, ornamental or sentimental - get rid of it! Once you've sorted everything, you'll feel like a huge wall has been lifted out your way and you can tackle anything! It’s important that you are not too stressed out at Christmas. It’s bad for you and your family and kids know when something is up, even if you’re pretending to be happy. Really try to enjoy yourselves and don’t make more work for yourself over tiny details.  Have them make and write their own cards, make tree decorations, write a Christmas story, make decorations for their room and even make a menu for the table on Christmas day while you take care of the important things. Whatever the time of year you should always be spending some family time together. It's therapeutic to sit down and play a board game, bake cookies or just watch a movie together. Be sure to read to them before they go to bed to help their imaginations as well as their sleep.  No seriously, second hand doesn't always mean shabby and dirty and plenty of things even look brand new but for lower prices. You'll surely find something and the earlier you go the better. A local Oxfam shop might be the best option so when 'Do they know it's Christmas' comes on the radio, you can be proud that you helped that charity. If this interests you and you have some cash to spare, there is a website called Oxfam unwrapped which lets you buy and send some of the things we take for granted and send them to third world countries. It’s worth a look!  , Children that are brought up well care about others and I’m sure they have plenty of things in their bedroom that can go those less fortunate. Why? Because that was exactly what the real St. Nicolas did. He gave his bags of gold to a poor family as they slept. Teach them the story, and why it feels good to give as well as receive. Make them feel that what they’re doing is important. This makes them feel special and happy. Get them - as well as yourself – to say a prayer of thanks and pray for those less fortunate.  Plenty of shops sell these. Pulling the paper of presents sure is exciting but walking into a living room Christmas morning and seeing a bag of prezzies is no less wonderful. Tell them to close their eyes and reach into the sack and pull their presents out one by one. Tons and tons of wrapping are thrown away every year. If you receive a present that's wrapped try to save the wrapping, it could come in useful. Recycle Christmas cards as well. Plenty of supermarkets have some sort of recycling scheme like this. Just check it out!  , Things might be getting stressful as the day draws ever nearer. When you’re alone and the house is quiet, try reversing some of the symptoms of stress through meditation. You don’t have to sit like a Buddha. A lot of people find it comfortable lying on the bed and clearing their minds. try to get some things done during the day to get things off your mind before you meditate as it will help clear your mind better. See sources below for some helpful guides to meditation. Listening to classical music or carols is also a good idea. Find some time to take a walk down the park or countryside for some fresh air as well. Maybe you could have a winter nature walk with the kids and see what you find.  Check out sources below for more information. Prices vary, but you’re sure to find something useful. One idea you might have on your walks is collecting pine cones into a pretty bowl and dusting them with icing sugar. They are great festive decorations and can be simply put back outside again once you’re done. Grow a holly bush as well or buy plastic holly. If you are buying plastic decorations look after them so you’re not throwing tattered pieces away every Christmas. The longer they last the better.  If you eat meat try to buy a free-range turkey. I'll be honest, they aren't always cheap but if you've been following my steps perhaps you have some cash to spare. You’d be doing a good thing and easing a perfectly normal conscience. For more detailed information on the subject, see sources below.  Brownies and cookies make great presents. They are more special that something bought and let’s them know how much you care to go to the effort. Nothing gets those festive thoughts going more than a bit of Christmas music. Play some in the background as it gets closer to that time. Try to work together with family more rather than being isolated and don’t be afraid to sing along yourself with the children or whoever as you’re licking the bowl clean. If your children believe in Santa bake some cookies for him and don’t forget to leave some carrots for his reindeer!  

buy a reusable advent calendar for your child.  a messy house always contributes to stress.  keeping the children busy shouldn't be too difficult as there is plenty for them to do!,  it might be a good idea to buy as many presents as you can from charity shops.  while were on the subject, get your children into the charitable feeling as well.  rather than spending your time wrapping presents a better idea might be to buy a cloth sack.  caring involves caring for you.  you can make decorations out of unwanted rubbish - a great activity for your kids to join in with – or you can by ready made recycled gifts that help the environment.  when planning your christmas meal try to use only seasonal vegetables and if you can grown locally.  baking is also good fun even if you’re not that good. 

 Cockatiels are typically very active birds. They are known to be social and curious. Since birds tend not to show signs of illness until they are very sick, it is important to know your cockatiel’s normal habits and behaviors. If anything changes, be on alert.For example, if your cockatiel is no longer coming up to you when you approach the cage, they may not be feeling well.; , A sudden drop in activity may mean that the bird is not doing well. Watch how active or energetic your bird is. Some signs of lethargy include:Sitting or lying on the bottom of the cage. Inability to fly or exercise. Sleeping for long periods of time. Ignoring you if they are normally social. Ignoring sounds or movement around them.  Any changes in the sound or tone of their voice might indicate a problem if joined by other symptoms. This could include loss of voice, crying frequently, inability to sing, or a weak quality of voice., In most cases, cockatiels sleep with one foot raised into their feathers. If your cockatiel is suddenly sleeping with both feet gripping the perch, consult a vet., Changes in appetite are one of the key symptoms of sickness in cockatiels. If the bird is either eating more or less than usual, take them to a vet.Changes in food or stress can also cause eating problems. If the cockatiel is sick, the loss of appetite will be accompanied by other symptoms.  Cockatiels drink about a teaspoon of water a day. A sick cockatiel may drink more than this if they have diarrhea or vomiting. There are other things, however, that can also cause this. Rule out these other causes first:The room may be too warm. They may be feeding their young. Their food may be too salty. They are very active.  

note changes in character.  observe their activity levels to determine if they have lethargy.  listen to their chirping for any changes.  observe how they sleep.  pay attention to how much they are eating.  track how much they are drinking to see if they are dehydrated. 

 Take it slowly and easily and if you don't feel that you can do the stretch, don't push it.  They don't have to be flat.   Turn your upper body slowly, and make absolutely sure that you stop turning when it starts to hurt. It is relatively easy to damage your spinal cord if you stretch improperly, so pay attention. When you stop turning, hold that position for 5 to 10 seconds. Turn the other direction, and repeat.  Be very careful not to go too far! Once you are in the bridge, push through your shoulders, and try to put your legs together and straighten them. Don't go onto your toes!   When you are doing the backbend, make sure your shoulders are over your hands or in line.  Stand up with your arms hanging out to the side. Then very slowly twist from side to side.  Lay flat on your tummy and then use your arms to put yourself in a snake or seal stretch.

 When you get ready to ask the guy out, have confidence in yourself. It may seem scary, but don’t let fear stop you from going through with it. Without confidence, you may end up giving in to insecurities. Remember, you are awesome and deserve nice things, so keep telling yourself that you can do this!Don’t be scared that the guy will not like it if you ask him out. Most guys today are okay with girls asking them out, and if they aren’t, they are probably not the guy for you!; , When you ask him out, make sure you look nice, but not too nice. You don’t want to dress up in clothes you don’t normally wear to ask him out. Wear clothes similar to what you usually wear when you see him, and keep your makeup and hair like you normally do, too. Don’t try to do something different to impress him. Just be your normal, wonderful self!For example, don’t put on a dress, fake eyelashes, and tons of makeup if this isn’t what you normally wear. This may make you seem too intense or desperate.  When you ask him out on a date, make sure to keep it low stakes and casual. Remember, this is a first date and you are still getting to know this guy, just as he’s getting to know you. Keeping it casual can put you both at ease and helps you avoid looking desperate or too intense.Try asking him for a casual meal. Say, “Would you like to go get coffee?” or “Would you like to grab lunch with me?”  , When asking your guy out on a date, try to have a specific date in mind. Saying something like “We should hang out” or “Let’s do something sometime” is non-committal and may not lead anywhere.

Wait until the two of your are alone to ask him out.If he’s around his friends, wait until the two of you are apart from the group. Start talking to him casually so you don’t bombard him with the question out of the blue.  Taking the step to ask a guy out puts you in a vulnerable position.

If you can brush off a guy turning you down, ask out whichever guys you want.Some people cannot handle romantic rejection. If you think it will hurt you too much to hear “no,” then you may want to wait for him to ask you out.  

be confident.  look nice but casual.  keep it low-key.  be specific when suggesting a date.  avoid asking him out in front of others.  ask the guy out if you can handle a rejection.

Whatever it is, make it a focal point that you are known for wearing with flair., If you can afford it, have some good quality clothing and accessory from designer labels. The more obvious that it's designer wear, the better.   Check out consignment stores and thrift stores if you want lower priced designer gear.  You might be outgoing and exuberant, attracted to talking to people everywhere, like many a celebrity. Or, you might be of the mysterious, "leave me alone" style of celebrity, who closely guards everything personal and only answers that which really needs to be answered when asked prying questions.   It's probably best to go with your natural personality style unless you're acting in a play or movie. It will be hard to sustain a different personality style for a long time in public.

Have lots of exotic fruits and uniquely carved vegetables in salads. Enjoy flavored water for your drink of choice.  Make a video with a "celebrity" friend that aims to inspire others.

 Be interested in your child’s life, and check in with them on a regular basis. Ask questions like what they’re working on in school, how their friends are, and what’s been getting under their skin lately.Give your child your full attention when you talk with them. Kids know when you’re tuning them out or just pretending to be interested. Don’t try to force your child to talk to you if they don’t want to, but do let them know that you’re available whenever they want to share something.; , To have a close relationship with your child, it’s important to do more than just talk with them. Find some activities you can do together on a regular basis, such as cooking a meal, going for a walk, or working on a hobby you share. Use your time together to catch up and bond over shared interests.As you spend time with your child, make sure that you are modeling good behaviors for them. Avoid fighting with or criticizing your spouse when your child is around.  Let your child know that you’re rooting for them, and offer sincere praise when they do something well. Don’t just focus on their achievements and skills – notice their positive personality traits like kindness, generosity, and helpfulness, too.For instance, you could say something like, “Jessica, I’m impressed that you stayed to help Maria clean up after her birthday party. That was thoughtful of you.” Try to avoid criticizing your child as well. If they do something wrong, point out the behavior and then explain why it is not acceptable.  Your behavior at home could be inadvertently influencing bullying in your child. If you're a parent who thinks children must be controlled by adults, you might use excessive disciplinary approaches. As a result, your child comes to believe that they must do the same to get their way.Observe your behaviors and take note of any excessive control techniques. Instead of trying to control your child, focus on teaching them to control themselves by helping them identify problem behaviors and come up with reasonable solutions on their own.  Build up your child’s confidence by letting them try new things and solve their own problems. Ask them to take on household tasks that reflect their skills and interests. 

talk to your child.  spend time with your child.  build your child’s self-esteem.  recognize any unintentional bullying on your behalf.  give your child more responsibilities as they get older. 

 In a dry pan over low heat, roast 3 tbsp (45 mL) chickpea flour, also referred to as gram flour or besam. Stir constantly until the flour starts turning brown and releasing an aroma, typically after 4 or 5 minutes.Remove from heat.; , Including peanuts will give the stuffed bhindi a thicker texture, and provide an additional flavor. If you have whole peanuts, you may increase the flavor and aroma by roasting approximately 2 tbsp (30 mL) peanuts in a dry pan over medium heat. Stir continuously for 3–4 minutes, then remove the nuts from heat.Wait a couple minutes for them to cool before chopping with a knife or crushing roughly with a mortar.   If you have pre-crushed peanuts, or pre-roasted peanuts, skip this step. Crushed nuts area easily burned by roasting, which ruins the flavor., These ingredients benefit from additional frying before the okra is cooked. Cover the bottom of a pan with a light layer of oil, then fry the following over low heat for about 5 minutes, or until the onions start turning brown:1 jalapeño, or other spicy chili, deseeded and chopped 1/2 small white or red onion, peeled and finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped  , Mix the chickpea flour, chopped peanuts, chile, onion, and garlic together, along with the remaining stuffing ingredients. The masala spice mix used varies from chef to chef, so feel free to experiment with your favorite spices. A typical mix adds all of the following spices to the ingredients listed above:   1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) cumin seeds 1/4 tsp (1 mL) turmeric powder 1 tsp coriander powder 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated. You may substitute 1–3 tsp (5–15 mL) ground ginger according to taste. 1 tsp (5 mL) dried mango powder (amchoor), available in South Asian grocery stores  , If you prefer a sweeter dish, you may add 3 tbsp (45 mL) grated coconut, and 2 tsps (30 mL) sugar of any kind.Other optional ingredients are listed with suggested amounts in the ingredients section, but read the following descriptions before you decide to add them:   Cilantro, also known as coriander, tastes like soap to people with a certain gene, making it a controversial ingredient.Fenugreek, or methi, is often used in Indian cooking, but often has a strong, bitter aroma and taste. Taste it before using in your dish if you are not familiar with it. Garam masala is a spice mix that varies greatly, depending who makes it. Taste it first or read the ingredients. Typically, it contains at least cinnamon, clove, pepper, and cardamom.  Wash the okra while rubbing its skin, then wipe dry with a clean towel. Leaving the okra wet may cause the vegetable to become slimier. Cooks disagree over whether this slimy texture is reduced or increased if you wash it in advance, rather than directly before cooking.Select small okra pods if possible, as these are more tender and flavorful.  Remove the pointed tips from each end of the okra. Cut a slit lengthwise in the okra, stopping about 1/4 in (6 mm) from one end. Gently pry apart the okra enough to reveal the seeds and opening inside, without breaking it in half.  Spoon the stuffing into the okra pods, filling them completely. If you have leftover stuffing, set it aside for later.  Add enough oil to cover the base of a pan or skillet. Heat on medium heat until an okra seed dropped it in sizzles. Ideally, avoid pans made from iron, copper, or brass, which may turn the okra skin black. Steel, enamel, or nonstick surfaces are all unlikely to cause this problem.   You may use any type of oil, but oil with a medium or high smoking point is less likely to burn. Canola oil and peanut oil are examples of oils with high smoking points., Reduce the heat to low to avoid burning the masala stuffing, then add the stuffed okra to the pan. Stir the ingredients occasionally, turning the okra over once the cooked side become dark green. This typically takes about 5–6 minutes on each side. It may take less time if you cover the pan, but the trapped moisture may cause the okra to become slimy, which many people do not enjoy.   If you have leftover masala, you may add it after the other ingredients have cooked for two or three minutes.  Stuffed bhindi can be a side dish to a large meal, or the main entreé. It is often served with South Asian bread, such as roti or chapati.Raita or yogurt is commonly served with it as well, to balance out the spicy flavor.  

dry roast chickpea flour.  dry roast, then chop whole peanuts (optional).  sauté chile, onion, and garlic.  mix all stuffing ingredients together with other stuffing spices.  consider optional ingredients.  wash and dry the okra.  trim and slit each okra pod.  fill each okra pod with the stuffing.  heat oil in a steel pan.  fry the stuffed okra over low heat.  serve with bread and raita. 

 Mix 1 cup (225 grams) of powdered sugar with 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of pineapple juice, beating them together with a whisk or fork until combined. The consistency should be fluid enough to drizzle but thick enough to hold its shape once it is on the baked good.   Use this icing on biscuits, fruit cookies, pound cake, and sugar cookies.  Whisk together 1/2 cup (113.4 grams) of powdered sugar with 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of pineapple juice. The glaze should be spread onto your baked goods and should be too fluid to retain any form.  The flavor of coconut naturally mixes well with the taste of pineapple. Whisk 1/2 cup (113.4 grams) of powdered sugar with 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of pineapple juice, 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 milliliters) of coconut extract, and 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 milliliters) of rum extract. The glaze should be very fluid and should be spread on instead of drizzled.   This tastes especially good on plain donuts and pound cake.  Whisk together 1 cup (225 grams) brown sugar with 3/4 cup (177 milliliters) pineapple juice until the sugar dissolves. Spread this glaze over ham and bake as directed.  

make a simple icing to drizzle over cookies, cakes, and other sweets.  create a glaze for cinnamon rolls, donuts, and other breads.  mix things up with a piña colada glaze.  use a pineapple glaze to bake ham. 

 Many scenes have several "layers" of sounds and music, from ambient sounds that might actually be heard at that location, such as traffic or birds, to sounds that are inserted to help create a mood. Many scenes also include music that helps to tell the story.   Keep in mind that the director may have deliberately taken out any true ambient sounds and inserted others. Imagine what you might actually hear at the scene's location and whether the director made a good choice in the sounds he or she included. Take note if the director inserted sounds to evoke a particular emotion from the audience. For instance, a beat or ticking clock creates a sense of urgency or dread. Listen to the music and ask yourself what it represents and whether it tells you what to expect. For example, a composer might create a particular melody that you will hear whenever a character is thinking about his lost love. Determine whether the movie contains original music or music the director has licensed from another artist. Ask yourself why the director chose one or the other (or both). Close your eyes and listen to music. Try to guess what is happening by what you hear. 

close your eyes and concentrate on what you hear during the scene.  note whether the scene is narrated and determine why the director included narration.  

 The first step towards overcoming learned dependency is believing that you can. When they arise, push your doubts out of your mind. Think about the possibilities instead.If you have a hard time believing you can change, trick yourself into it by pretending. Tell yourself that you’ll just make a few small changes in your life and see what happens. Act like its not big deal.  Identify some bite-sized steps you can take towards reclaiming control over your life. No change is too small – right now, the point is to convince yourself that you really do have the freedom to make your own choices.Don’t try to make a big change right away, or you may end up overwhelmed and frustrated. Maybe you could get a new haircut, have something different for breakfast, or rearrange your bedroom.  Realize that failure is only temporary. It’s a natural opportunity to learn and improve at things, not a permanent character flaw. Get comfortable with the idea of imperfection, and allow yourself to do new or scary things even if you might fail at first.It takes a good attitude to fail constructively. Instead of being hard on yourself, ask yourself, “What could I have done better or differently? What will I take away from this?”  , Strengthen your problem-solving skills by refusing to give up when something is hard for you. Be creative and try different things as you search for solutions. 

replace self-doubt with faith in possibility.  start with small changes.  shift your perspective on failure.  be persistent. 

 In puppies, the risk of complications from the coronavirus (CCV) is greater since they are more prone to dehydration. Any puppy with diarrhea that is off color or who is vomiting should be checked by a vet. Likewise any puppy that has diarrhea lasting more than 24 hours should be seen by a vet because of the risk of dehydration.   To check for dehydration, grasp the skin of the scruff and lift it up away from the shoulders. When you release the skin it should spring immediately back into place. If you can see the skin settle back down or it takes a second or more, then the puppy is dehydrated. If you are able to detect dehydration this way, then the dog may need intravenous fluids to support his circulation and protect organ function. Your puppy may also have the respiratory type of CCV, which presents with symptoms that look like a respiratory infection. Take your puppy to the vet if he has any respiratory symptoms.; , The most concerning type of CCV is the virus that presents with digestive symptoms. Because dogs with the coronavirus most often get diarrhea, dehydration is the most concerning result of a CCV infection. If you are concerned about dehydration but the puppy isn't clinically dehydrated, then make sure he is drinking. If he is reluctant to drink fluids, then gently syringe water into his mouth. Give a little bit at the time and often, but never squirt the fluid in quickly. Give the puppy a chance to swallow so that the fluid isn't accidentally inhaled into the lungs.If you have access to an electrolyte replacement fluid, such as Lectade or dioralyte, this will pass more easily across the dog's stomach wall than water and is better at preventing dehydration.  If your pet has had diarrhea connected to the canine coronavirus, you should feed him a bland diet that is easy on his stomach. Feed little and often, such as four to six small portions spread over the day.A prescription enteritis diet is better than chicken and rice since it contains vitamins and minerals that a growing puppy needs.  Though you may think your dog needs medicine to help him get better, your dog may not need it. Antibiotics are unlikely to make any difference since the infection is viral. However, if your puppy is sick, the vet may prescribe antibiotics to control any secondary infections he may have developed.For example, if your dog has the respiratory type of CCV, he may develop a respiratory infection that requires antibiotics.  Coronavirus cannot be treated directly because it is a virus and drugs are ineffective at killing viruses. In adult dogs, the infection is usually not dangerous and the diarrhea will go away of its own accord after 12 days or so. In adult dogs, you should manage the diarrhea by providing plenty of fresh drinking water so that the dog can replace lost fluids and doesn't become dehydrated.In addition, a bland diet such as chicken and rice, or a commercial prescription diet designed to soothe gastroenteritis, can speed up resolution of the stomach upset. Divide the daily food allowance into four servings, and space the four meals out over the day.  

take puppies to the vet.  treat dehydration in puppies at home.  feed the puppy bland food.  give the dog antibiotics only when there's an underlying condition.  manage coronavirus in adult dogs. 

 One of the first things people notice about someone is their teeth and mouth. As soon as all your milk teeth have been replaced with your set of permanent teeth, its important that you look after them well as they are the only ones you will ever have!   Brush your teeth twice daily, in the morning and after dinner. This is important as it scrubs away sugar that could feed off the enamel in your tooth and cause cavities. Using a good fluoride toothpaste, apply a pea-sized dollop of toothpaste onto a toothbrush. Be sure to scrub in a way that would push the 'grime' away from your gums. Replace your toothbrush every three or so months. Select one that is best suited for your gum type. It is recommended that you use one with soft bristles as ones with hard bristles can cause bleeding gums. Try to floss from as young an age as possible. Purchase a good dental floss from a brand you trust. Flossing removes any food that gets stuck in between your teeth which a toothbrush cannot properly reach. You do not need to floss twice a day, flossing once a day after dinner would suffice. If you are over the age of 13, invest in a good mouth wash. Use this after breakfast to kill off bad breath and make you feel fresh and cleaner instantly. Bad breath is a big no-no when it comes to personal hygiene. Listerine is a well-known brand of mouthwash which does the trick well. Ask your local dentist for any recommendations on great mouth washes.; , When you are relaxing after a long, hard day, it can be irresistibly tempting to go to bed straight after dinner without having a shower. Not so fast! If we didn't take showers, how else would be get rid of all the dirt and grime we project ourselves to on a daily basis?   Find a shampoo and conditioner that works best with your hair type. Do you find your hair is constantly frizzy, or does it break really easy? Maybe it gets very oily during the day, or maybe there isn't much wrong with it at all! There are plenty of conditioners for different hair types on the market, so read the bottle before you buy to see if it is best suited to your hair. This also requires a bit of trial and error. If you aren't really sure what brand or what type of shampoo/conditioner works best for your hair, shop around a bit and try different kinds until you find one which you find works for you. Ask your hairdresser for assistance. Don't forget, it is there profession! However, if they suggest you buy one of their upper-market brands, be careful. These people are also sales persons! Plus, expensive brands do not necessarily work the best. Plenty of drugstore hair shampoos and conditioners work a lot better for some people than expensive salon types. Once you have found your ideal shampoo and conditioner, Try to wash your hair every other day. Do not wash your hair every night as it will dry it out. Always wash your hair after participating in any activities such as swimming in the ocean or in a swimming pool and remember to always use both shampoo and conditioner every time you wash your hair, not just one of the two. Find a good body wash which smells good and works well for you! Even just looking for one in your chemist or drugstore will suffice. You don't need to go and spend a fortune on this! Just find something which you like the smell of. Invest in a good razor! If you are a girl over the age of 14 or so, you should definitely consider either shaving or waxing your legs! Getting a good razor and spending a little more is probably better in the long run than buying a cheap disposable razor and getting cut seven times by it!  , Acne or pimples are no fun to have around, and can make your skin red and irritated. But before you Try to pop your zits (and end up with big scars on your face), try getting a good face wash. Like shampoo and conditioners, not everyone will suit the same face wash. It all depends on your skin type. Just because your friend finds a certain brand of face wash works well for them, doesn't necessarily mean it will work the same for you. However, it doesn't hurt to try. Shop around a bit until you find something your face (and your wallet!) is happy with.   Wash your face every morning after you wake up. Not only will it create a stable face washing routine, it will also help you to feel more awake and alert. Just think of it as an alternative to coffee! Make sure to tie your hair out of your face when washing it. You don't want your hair falling into the water! This includes pinning back your bangs and any other wisps of hair which might fall out. Wash your face with warm water. This will open up your pores and flush out all the dirt in them which causes zits. Careful! Don't rub your face too hard, otherwise your skin and acne will become even more irritated, making the zits redder!  , This is extremely important as nobody wants to smell bad. Let's face it, sitting next to someone who's sweating isn't exactly everybody's cup of tea. There are many different scents of deodorants you can use. Most deodorants (or antiperspirants) come in either a roll-on or spray bottle. The only difference between the two is how they are applied. Apply antiperspirant in the underarms only. If using a spray bottle, spray approximately 15 centimeters (5.9 in) away from your underarm.   Find one that smells good! There's no point of using a deodorant if it smells disgusting. Whilst it may seem slightly odd to go to your friends and ask them what kind of deodorant they use, you can quietly find out what brands of deodorant they like by seeing what they keep in their bags after working out at the gym etc. Try to keep a deodorant with you if you know you'll be participating in any type of physical activity or something that you know will cause you to work up a sweat! Keep a bottle in your school locker or your gym bag just to be on the safe side. Don't use too much of it! There's no need to drench yourself in it. Don't get deodorant mixed up with perfume.  Using makeup frequently clogs up your pores, which is the cause of zits and pimples! Try to stick with the fresh-faced beauty look where possible. Love the skin you're in and you will be truly beautiful!   If you need to use makeup, try to avoid sticky kinds! This will double the chances of getting pimples as it is oily and will sink into your pores easier, and that is not cleanly! Keep a simple look when using makeup. Try to stick to neutral colors. They give you a more clean look! Either do something dramatic with your eyes or lips, NOT BOTH! Your goal is to look clean and simple, not transform into a clown! Always remove makeup before you go to bed to avoid it from clogging up your pores overnight.  Keep a rubbish bin in any room you might do any eating or craft-type activities in so whenever you need to throw away rubbish you have a bin to use and you're not tempted to throw it on the ground.  

maintain good oral hygiene.  this one may seem obvious, but take showers daily!,  find a face wash which works for you.  use a good antiperspirant!,  remember, when it comes to makeup, less is more!,  be sure to clean your bedroom and house often! 

 Knowing if you have oily, normal, dry, or sensitive skin will determine what kind of product you should look for when buying a cleansing product from your local store or pharmacy. The main two categories of treatment are those with benzoyl peroxide, and those with salicylic acid.   Products with these active ingredients can cause allergic reactions. If your skin reacts badly, stop using it.You can actually have more than one type, which is "combination". For example, your nose and forehead may be oily, but you may have dryness on your cheeks. Most acne-prone skin is actually "sensitive", as acne tends to react to products such as harsh soap, makeup, or fragrances. If in doubt, go with products designed for sensitive skin.; , If you have sensitive skin that can dry out and be irritable it is best to go for a product with salicylic acid. Just check the ingredients on the package in the store to know which is which. Salicylic acid is more gentle to the skin, rarely causes redness and peeling, and works more slowly than the stronger alternatives.Look out particularly for products that combine salicylic acid with glycolic acid., If you don’t have particularly sensitive skin that is not prone to drying out, seek out products that have benzoyl peroxide. This key ingredient breaks up the waxy clog so it loosens and comes out of the pore. This is the fastest working store-bought option, but it can be a little harsh on your skin.The strength of the benzoyl peroxide usually ranges between 2.5 and 10%. This, combined with how long you leave the product on your skin, can influence any irritation you may experience. If your skin is sensitive, you can try a product at the lowest percentage and don't leave it on your skin too long. Benzoyl peroxide can be harsh on your skin, but it is also more effective than salicylic acid.  Alpha hydroxy acids (AHA) include glycolic acid and can be very effective at exfoliating your skin.You will find glycolic acid in daily exfoliators as well as chemical face peels. It dissolves and releases dead skin cells, which is an excellent way to tackle your blackheads.   Use it in the same way you would a benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid product, and always read the instructions. AHAs can increase sensitivity to the sun, so be careful if you are going out in bright sunlight after using this treatment., Skin products are usually sold as either face washes or topical creams. A topical cream is usually left on longer, which means it has more time to work, but it is also more likely to irritate your skin. Follow the guidelines for the given product, and be especially careful if you have sensitive skin.  

figure out your skin type.  for more sensitive skin, choose a product with salicylic acid.  use benzoyl peroxide.  consider an alpha hydroxy acid product.  decide if you want to use a topical cream or face wash. 

 It's best to go with a pair that fits you snugly around the hips. Stretchy denims works well.          Wear them inside-out. Take a crayon or marker, and draw a line on both legs to show how tight you want them to be. Remember to make the line on the inside so when you wear them you can't see the seams on the outside of the leg. Make sure you draw the line on the opposite side of the manufacturer's original seam. You can use pins to tack, but you might end up poking yourself or the pins might end up coming out when you take the jeans off. As an alternative, take a pair of skinny jeans you already own as a guide. Spread out the pair you want to reconstruct inside-out and lay the skinny jeans on top (lining up the crotch). Make sure the seam is evenly on the edge (of both pairs) and take your chalk down the side of your pants, starting about mid-thigh, mirroring the line of the skinnies.  Iron your jeans first to make everything easier. Flat, unwrinkled jeans are easier to work with.  ; , Choose thread that is preferably dark and blends in with the color of your jeans. Jean thread is best as it can withstand the wear and tear your jeans will go through. Thread your needle after slipping off your jeans, and begin to sew. Trace over the line you drew with the running stitch.          Start on the seam that is already there, backstitch a few times, and carefully follow your line all the way down making sure the edge of the denim remains flat. (Pins work for that.)If you're using a sewing machine and concerned the first go-round may not be ideal, set your machine to the loosest stitch in case you have to take it out.  Walk around in them to see that the legs fit well, or you may want to jog a little -- sometimes jeans can come loose if you start moving around, in which case you'll need to tighten them.          If you're unhappy, remove the stitches. But if they're tight, short, and spaced closely so that there are no bumps in your jeans and the stitches won't be pulled out in the wash, you're good to go. Work over each stitch as perfectly and as carefully as you can -- there's nothing worse than having a brand new pair of skinny jeans for one day and then having the stitches all pulled out the next. This will be hard work, but it is essential.  Cut any excess fabric if necessary (use a zigzag stitch beforehand) or go over it with a serger, which will seal off the edge and cut off the fabric at the same time.          However, you might want to wear and wash your jeans at least once before you start cutting them up, in case you want to go back and fix something later on.  

put on your jeans to get an idea of the shape you want.  grab a needle and thread.  try on your jeans to see if they fit.  go over the seam again with a much shorter stitch. 

 Generally, synthetic fabrics such as nylon or rayon trap heat and moisture close to your skin. Bacteria develops rapidly in this environment, and can lead to exercise-related acne.Choose light, breathable garments for exercising. You may have to experiment to find the right combination or fabric blend that works best for you. If you're prone to acne, lightweight cotton garments that fit loosely may be your best option to avoid exercise-related acne. There are active fabrics that are specifically designed to wick moisture away from the body. Since clothing made from these fabrics may be more expensive, try them first and see if you notice any benefit from them. For example, you might buy a moisture-wicking shirt and monitor your skin over the course of a week.  If your skin has repeated contact with surfaces that haven't been cleaned or sanitized, you could be introducing bacteria that can seep into your pores and cause exercise-related acne.This is particularly true in gyms, where there are many different people using the machines and other equipment. Make sure you wipe down any surface your skin will touch, including handles, before you start exercising. The same applies to your own equipment in your home. You may want to bring along inexpensive anti-bacterial wipes with you in case the gym doesn't have any available. Don't just use a towel – especially not one that you later use to blot sweat from your skin. You also want to wipe down any equipment or accessories that you wear on your body, such as headphones or a helmet you wear while cycling. When these materials get sweaty, they can become a breeding ground for bacteria and cause breakouts.  If you have towels to blot sweat, don't use the same towel for your face as you use for other parts of your body. Gym towels typically are white, but finding a colored one for your face can help you keep them separate.If you're a member of a gym that supplies towels, you may want to bring your own facial towel so that you don't mix them up, and you can be sure that it's clean. Don't use the same gym towel for more than one exercise session. That sweaty towel from yesterday is growing bacteria and yeast while it sits in your gym bag, which could lead to breakouts if you use it again. If you're exercising outdoors during a hot day, or doing particularly high-intensity exercise, you may want several towels so you can swap them out when one gets too damp.  Bacteria and yeast will grow on your dirty, sweaty clothing. Wearing the same clothes for more than one exercise session without washing them can cause exercise-related acne.There may be some items, such as an exercise bra, that you routinely wear for several sessions before washing. Bacteria may build up, especially with the friction of the garment rubbing against your sweaty body, leading to breakouts. The sooner you can wash your clothes after your workout, the better. Wash in cool water with a strong detergent that will kill the bacteria. If you don't want to run the washing machine or go to the laundromat after every session, you can wash the garments in the sink if you need to wear them the next day.  

wear natural fabrics.  keep your equipment and accessories clean.  bring more than one towel.  wash workout clothes after every session. 

 This recipe is slightly more complex but is extra tasty, so give these a go if your dog is a picky eater.Ingredients should be available at your local natural food store.

buy ingredients.  gather and prepare your supplies.  make the dough.  form and bake the treats. 

 If you have been drinking, have someone else drive you, take a taxi, or just walk. Don’t put yourself in the position of getting into serious trouble and possible injuring other people. You can also minimize the possibility of getting stopped by making sure that your car is in good operating order, that all your headlights and taillights are working properly, and by obeying all the rules of the road., If a police officer does pull you over while you are driving, you may be able to avoid a DUI arrest if you are respectful and cooperative. You may not know why the officer stopped you, and it could be for something unrelated to drinking. If you can address the officer’s initial concerns, you may avoid further problems., As with any other criminal charge, you are presumed innocent until proven guilty, and you have the right not to incriminate yourself. If the officer asks whether you have been drinking or where you are coming from, you should politely decline to answer. Answering these questions is not likely to help you, but your answers could get you into further trouble.Understand that the familiar Miranda warnings do not generally apply to a DUI traffic stop because you are not deemed to be "in custody" at the time.Know that whatever you say may be used against you in court, whether or not the officer recites the Miranda warnings.  It will be important for your defense later to try to recall as many details as possible from your traffic stop. Pay attention to what the police officer says and directs you to do.  There are a few different tests that the police officer may instruct you to take at the time of the stop. If you participate in these, you should pay attention to as many details as possible about their administration. If the officer does not administer the tests properly, you may be able to challenge the results later in court. There are three primary tests that are likely to be administered:Nystagmus gaze test. The officer will position an object, usually a pen or a finger, about a foot in front of the driver’s face and move the object from side to side while watching the eye movement. This is generally a reliable test, although some people may successfully challenge it in court because the police officers are not medically trained. The walk and turn test. This test is about 68% accurate in determining whether a driver is under the influence of alcohol. The officer will ask the driver to walk in a straight line and then turn around and return. The test can be challenged in court if the officer fails to administer the test on solid, level ground, or if the driver had some other condition that would interfere, such as leg or back pain. The one-leg stand. The officer will ask the driver to lift one leg and stand still on the other, usually while counting. Drivers may be able to challenge this test if the ground was not level, if the driver was wearing high heels, or if the driver has leg or back problems.  If the officer administers either a breathalyzer or blood or urine test, you should try to note the type of test, as well as the time that it is administered. Some states have certain requirements about when these tests must be administered in relation to the traffic stop. If too much time goes by, the test may not be valid. In some states, you also have the right to request an independent test of your own, and if this does not happen, you may challenge the test as well., Depending on your familiarity with the law of your jurisdiction, you may wish to refuse a breathalyzer or blood or urine test. However, be aware that many states have enacted “implied consent” laws, which basically say that when you get your license and operate a motor vehicle, you are giving your consent to a chemical test. If you are stopped in a state with implied consent laws, then refusing to undergo the test could result in suspension or loss of your license, regardless of the result. It is important for you to understand your local laws before making this decision.In many states with implied consent laws, simply refusing to take a breathalyzer test is treated as an indication of guilt, or is a crime by itself. Whether you are ultimately found guilty of DUI, you could have your license suspended just for refusing the test., As soon as possible after your traffic stop, write down your observations. Keep thorough notes of what the officer did and said, and how any tests were administered. These notes may provide you or your attorney with details that could help your case at trial and minimize an suspension of your license., A good attorney who is experienced in the field of criminal defense work, and particularly working with DUI charges, will be able to help you challenge your stop and may be able to reduce the charges against you.   If you have the resources to hire your own attorney, look for someone with experience in your area, in working with DUI cases. Try to get a referral from someone you know, or contact the bar association in your area for possible referrals. If you cannot afford an attorney, the court is required to appoint you a public defender. If you are in police custody, ask for an attorney right there. If not, contact either the police station or district attorney’s office to find out how to have a public defender appointed to you.  In most states, a police officer must have a valid reason for stopping you in the first place. If you were driving safely and there was no supportable reason for stopping you, then everything else that came from the stop may be inadmissible in court., Very often, a DUI conviction rests on the police officer’s own conclusion that you “appeared” to be under the influence. Usually, this will be based on such factors as slurred speech, watery or bloodshot eyes, or the smell of alcohol. You may be able to challenge these conclusions by providing alternative reasons. If you were ill, had been using mouthwash recently, or were overtired, you may be able to explain the officer’s observations., As noted above, the field sobriety tests have only about a 65% reliability level when administered properly.While this statistic alone is not likely to help you, you can question whether the officer administered the tests properly, or raise alternate explanations for your ability to perform well. If you had a recent injury, if you were overly tired at the time, or if you believe the officer did not explain the instructions adequately, you may be able to minimize the value of the officer’s testimony.  If there was anyone else with you in the car, or if you were with other people before driving, those witnesses may be able to testify that you were not drinking or that there was some other explanation for the police officer’s observations.For example, if the officer stopped you because you went through a stop sign, a witness might testify that you went through the stop sign because you were distracted by the conversation in the car. (This doesn’t make running the traffic light acceptable, but the penalty is much less severe than DUI.)  , Share with your attorney all your notes and impressions of the traffic stop and answer any questions he or she may have about the incident. The attorney will be able to inform you of the legal proceedings that you can expect.  Whether or not you are represented by an attorney, you will help yourself if you are familiar with the courtroom expectations. You may want to visit a courtroom and simply observe a trial in progress.  After reviewing all of the evidence, you may wish to meet with the prosecuting attorney and enter into an agreement, called a plea bargain, for a lesser charge. By doing this, you may be able to avoid the harshest penalties and could prevent a suspension of your license. By avoiding trial, you avoid the uncertainty of whatever outcome a judge or jury may impose, and you gain a level of control. Depending on the evidence against you, the prosecutor may or may not be willing to offer a deal of this sort, but it is worth considering., If there is no plea bargain, then you will need to present your case at a hearing or trial. Whether you do this on your own or with an attorney, you will need to be organized and appear professional. You need to show the court that you are a responsible individual and raise doubts regarding the charges against you. You will have the opportunity to challenge any witnesses that the prosecution presents, and then to present your own witnesses or explanations for the incident., If this was a first offense, you may be able to convince the judge to assign some alternative punishment, rather than suspending your license. This could include having your vehicle fitted with an ignition interlock device, which prevents your car from starting if your blood alcohol level exceeds a certain minimum.Understand that many jurisdictions have harsh DUI laws, and the prosecutor and/or judge may have limited leeway in assigning the punishment.  If you were successful in reducing the charge against you to avoid a suspension of your license, there may very likely be certain restrictions. You may be required to seek counseling or attend a program like Alcoholics Anonymous. Whatever the requirements, be sure to meet them in a timely fashion and report back to the court or prosecutor as ordered, in order to save your license., The original trial does not have to be the final word. If you are convinced that you are innocent of the charges, and if you believe that there were some irregularities that prevented you from having a fair trial, you can file an appeal. Understand that appeals can be costly, and time consuming, and that if the trial judge ordered a suspension of your license, then your license will likely be suspended pending the outcome of any appeal. However, in the end, if you succeed, then your record would be cleared., If your license is suspended, and if you choose not to appeal, then you should take steps to minimize the time that you are without it. In some states, in order to drive again, you need to file a special application to reinstate your license, and pay a fee.Make yourself aware of these procedures and take care of the reinstatement as soon as you can.  

avoid getting stopped at all, if possible.  be courteous and respectful if you are stopped.  invoke your fifth amendment privilege.  be alert and try to remember everything that happens.  perform the field sobriety tests as accurately as you can.  pay attention to any chemical test that is administered.  consider refusing the chemical test.  keep written notes.  hire an experienced dui attorney.  challenge the police officer’s probable cause for stopping you.  question the officer’s conclusion that you were under the influence.  challenge the validity of the field sobriety tests.  gather witnesses to help you present your case.  meet with your attorney.  familiarize yourself with trial procedures.  consider a plea bargain.  attend the trial or hearing.  suggest alternative punishments to avoid suspension of your license.  comply with any orders of the court or prosecutor related to a plea bargain.  file an appeal, if you are convicted.  apply to have your license reinstated as soon as possible.

 When visiting your doctor; he will first need to know some information on your life style, job nature and if you perform any kind of sports, tough types of sports that may involve strong or stressful sudden moves can over stretch the plantar ligaments leading to their irritation.   In addition to any history of previous injuries that may affect your feet, your medical profile and any chronic medical condition or medicines that you may have or take would be discussed too, before carrying physical examination.  While physical examination; doctor will search for any signs of heel swelling, tenderness point under the heel, pain and inflammation that can be manifested while gentle foot moving.   When asking the patient to take few steps, the doctor will also ask the patient to describe his pain onsets, when does he feel it usually and its severity, having strong pain first at the morning, when climbing stairs and after strong activities are positive signs of plantar fasciitis. He may ask the patient to make some flexes to his affected foot, pain can also arise while doctor exerts a kind of pressure with his fingers on the weakened plantar fascia ligaments. 

provide your doctor with your medical history.  allow the doctor to perform a physical examination.  go for an x-ray or mri.the doctor may ask the patient to perform x-rays or mri (magnetic resonance imaging) on his affected foot, these imaging tests are not for confirming the diagnosis, but they can exclude other optional medical cases that can trigger similar kinds of symptoms like bone fractures. 

 Taking unnecessary breaks will only eat up your limited exam time; make sure you use the washroom, fill your water bottle, and so on, before you enter the examination room or hall. Do your best to focus, and avoid letting your mind wander. If you are finished or convinced that you can’t answer anymore questions, stay and review your exam instead of leaving. Attempting to address questions you don’t know the answer to may leave you with extra marks, while leaving them blank will guarantee you get nothing.  Check your watch or the nearest clock periodically to keep track of how much of the exam remains; to avoid looking up too often, check only when you finish a question or turn a page. If this is too distracting, take off your watch (or pull out your cellphone, if allowed) and place it directly in front of you. Note how long you are spending on each question and try to stick to the number of minutes you budgeted for each question; if you are taking too long on a question, flag it for later and move on.  Worry is normal during an exam, but letting panic get the best of you can waste a lot of precious time. If you start to feel overwhelmed, give yourself a moment to collect yourself and calm your mind. To do this effectively, put down your pen or pencil, close your eyes, and focus on your breathing; try to think positive thoughts. Once you feel stronger, resume the exam., Ensure that you stay comfortable during the exam by bringing a bottle of water with you, and a sweater that you can easily put on or remove. Anxiety is linked to temperature changes in the body, meaning that your exam worry can cause symptoms that might distract you and impede your work. Some physical manifestations of anxiety that affect temperature are:   Vasoconstriction: when blood vessels tense up and cause the body to overheatSweating: the body's response to vasoconstriction (to cool your body down)Over-sensitivity: discomfort caused by heightened sensitivity to the hot or cold, Take a final opportunity to complete any questions that you don’t know the answer to, which may at least earn you a few extra points. Have a strategy in mind for completing these questions before you get to them. When “guessing”, remember that:   multiple choice answers that feel familiar are likely to be correct. choosing longer multiple choice answers over shorter ones is usually the best bet.the answers to difficult questions may be found in prior questions. 

avoid taking breaks and leaving early.  keep a close watch on the time.  avoid letting exam anxiety get the best of you.  keep yourself comfortable.  make one last attempt at answering difficult questions.

Underneath this are the manga chapters! They start from the most recently updated, so you will need to scroll down to the bottom of the page for the very first chapter. Once you've chosen a chapter, just click through the pages and read!  , If you still couldn't find what you were looking for, go to http://www.mangafox.com/directory/ by clicking on the "Manga Directory" link from the bar at the top. Once you're there, a list of all the manga they have on file should pop up. Clicking on the headers for each column will order the list by that particular field, so you can order the list by title alphabetically, by overall rating, by number of views, by number of chapters and by how recently it was last updated.  Clicking the "Option" button on the Manga Directory page will open up a plethora of ways you can narrow down your manga selection.   Choose from Japanese Manga, Korean Manwha, Chinese Manhua or Any. They generally have different drawing styles, and manwha and manhua are read left to right as opposed to right to left. Do you have a favourite author or artist? Here you can filter down the selection to include only works by them, if you want. Narrow down by genre. Hovering your mouse over the name of a genre will display a quick description of it if you're not completely sure what it is. If you click once on the genre name it will include it in your search; twice and it will exclude it from your search and clicking three times will just deselect it again. So, for example: Clicking twice on Drama will completely exclude all manga tagged with the drama genre from your search results. Filter by year. Different years will have different content and different styles of drawing, on the whole. You can specify that the manga is from a particular year, or that it originates before or after a particular year, e.g. all manga first published after 1995. Pick your rating. You can do this to choose manga of a particular rating to show up in your search, however instead you could just order the results you do get by rating. Specify whether you want a completed series or not. Series that aren't completed may have stopped in the middle of the story and will not be updated again. Also with incomplete series, you might have to wait a while before the ending is published. However, the incomplete series are mostly a lot more recent, and it is easy to check for updates using the bookmarks feature or something like the All Mangas extension for Google Chrome. It's your choice.  Just click the "Register" button at the top right of every page. Read and agree to the forum rules, choose a username and password, enter your email address, do a quick captcha and you're good to go! You will also need to enter your date of birth, but if you choose to hide it only the administrator will be able to see it. There are a couple of other bits of information you can enter at this stage: your time zone, etc. but these are not essential.  At the top of the central page for each individual manga there will be a bookmark option (as shown in the picture). If you are signed in you can click this and the manga will be added to your bookmarks.   You can access your bookmarks via the green "Bookmark" tab at the top right of every page when you are signed in. This will show a list all of the manga you have bookmarked.

 Brushing your teeth after every meal is the absolute best way to get a glistening smile. And if you have braces that gives you an even better reason to brush your teeth because think of the plaque and bacteria that is building up behind those wires! Also, never forget to floss. It may be hard, but when you get older, you're going to be glad that you did.; , There is no excuse for not taking a shower. Try to take at least one shower a day. Not only will you smell good, but you will also be super clean and healthy.  If you want to be glamorously thin and healthy then exercise! Don't just sit on the couch all day. You want to be active and outgoing. Exercising is a great way to burn those calories that you gained from eating that bowl of ice cream or from that bag of candy. But do not over exercise because that will wear out your muscles. Try about 30 minutes a day.  Washing your face in the morning and at night everyday is a great way to dry out your skin- wash your face once daily, with luke-warm water. Brand names aren't necessarily the best.  Let's make this simple, don't eat more than three candies a week OR two bowls of ice cream in a week. And especially hamburgers, too many of those can cause health problems. So try to eat at least 3 servings of fruits and vegetables, 8 glasses of water, 2 cups of milk, a 1 serving of meat everyday, and maybe a small candy for desert.  Try not to show too much skin because you don't want to give the wrong impression about yourself.  Styling your hair will make you and your outfit look fabulous.  You may think that studying is boring and a waste of time, but it really works. At least re-read the section in the textbook and take some notes,then take about ten minutes to study the notes, just to store all the information in your head until test time.  Doing homework will raise your grade big time. Even if you have to stay up until midnight( which should not happen)just get it done. Homework is excellent practice for tests, and will keep your grades higher than ever.  Paying attention in class will give you an understanding of what your homework is, help you extremely for tests, and will fill your head will knowledge and big words that you talk to your friends with. Listening will make you look and be smart.  Cursing makes you look dirty. As in what you say very much affects what people think of you as a person. So if you curse, try to stop because no one wants to hear a dirty mouth that gives bad examples for kids in a lower grade than you. I don't care if your friends do it or if it's 'cool' because it's not.  Smoking and doing drugs are just plain stupid choices to make. It's extremely bad for your health and not to mention just terrible. Also, don't ever listen to commercials or your friends that say 'do it because it's cool' or 'just try a little it won't hurt' those are ALL lies, it's not cool and it will affect your life big time.  Just try to go a week without watching it and see how much better you feel. Pick up a book or exercise instead.  

brush your teeth regularly.  shower daily.  exercise and keep fit.  wash your face.  eat a healthy diet.  don't wear revealing clothing.  style your hair.  study.  do all of your homework.  pay close attention.  don't swear.  do not smoke or do drugs.  try not to watch too much tv; it is addictive. 

 Lyra is clever and canny. Learn as many things as you can and answer every question thrown at you. Don't think that Lyra is loud-mouthed, she is quite quiet but is a little louder around adults. Be cheeky, lie about things that you have done. Try to make people laugh, smile as much as possible but glare at people who are boring/annoying/insulting you. Be rebellious and do the opposite of what others ask of you. Don't follow orders that you don't see sense in.; , She can read the alethiometer, so study symbols from the book and from other sources (of course, if you learn them off by heart then even better!). Remember that the alethiometer has a millions- or in fact infinitive- meaning. If you know all of them then perhaps consider getting a real alethiometer. Lyra lived at Jordan College for a very long time and was taught many things, while with Mrs Coulter so know a lot on subjects like science (particularly atoms and electrons), Greek mythology, history, and mathematics. Lyra knows how to sew, so practice sewing, embroidery, or knitting. Try reading books on a lot of facts (useless and can be used facts).  Obviously it would be silly to run around in long brown dresses, aprons and furs. Instead, ask yourself what you think Lyra would wear. She's a tomboy, so comfortable clothing and not too decorative clothing is a good idea. Come up with new ideas and play around with styles until you find something you like. (In fact don't wear any makeup, unless you need to.) It is against Lyra's world for girls to wear trousers so try wearing skirts, dresses even better. If you hate dresses and skirts do not be afraid to wear what you think Lyra would wear if she was in this world.  Lyra does experiment with makeup whilst living with Mrs. Coulter, but she wouldn't have time for it on an everyday basis, especially when rescuing Roger from Bolvangar! Keep your look natural. Wear brown eyeliner instead of black, apply blusher, blend light brown and lilac eyeshadow on your eyelid, and use a small amount of light pink or clear gloss. Use a foundation with moisturizer or sunscreen.  It's best if your hair is naturally wavy or curly, but if it's not, curl it with an iron if you really want to. In the books, Lyra's hair is blonde, but in the movies, it's a brownish-reddish color. Of course it isn't really what you look like, it is more how you act that makes you like Lyra. But practice looking innocent and slightly rude and rebellious.  Pantalaimon is Lyra's daemon, who takes the form of an ermine most often. However, you must be very careful about doing this. Don't buy a real pet and carry it around with you! Instead, either find a small stuffed animal you really like or make an imaginary daemon, and name it something exotic. The latter might be the best to opt for, as this type of daemon will seem much more real than a simple stuffed toy, and you can decide what animal it is! Remember the forms that Pantalaimon is, which are mainly: ermine, wildcat, moth, forms of birds, even a dragon and a lion!  , How she acts to what other people say, watch the film or read the books and write down things you could say in real life to similar situations.  

change your attitude first.  develop the skills that lyra has.  dress as lyra would if she were in this world.  apply makeup sparingly.  keep your hair long.  get a daemon.  study the way she acts, note what she says in certain situations. 

 You should be checking and adjusting the chemical levels in your spa 1-2 times a week. You can buy spa test strips from most department stores or from a spa store. Packages of these strips cost around 7 dollars, and some test strips provide 6-in-1 readings, including total alkalinity, calcium hardness, chlorine, pH, bromine, and total hardness. Put these strips in your spa for as little as 15 seconds and then view the results.; , When adjusting hot tub chemical levels, add one chemical to the water, and then wait a full two hours before adding another chemical. This will allow the chemicals to disperse naturally and will help to maximize their effectiveness. Waiting also minimizes the risk of a chemical reactions between the additives that can cause problems.   Keep your spa cover off for at least 15 minutes after you have added your chemicals. Keep your spa water running when you add the chemicals. This is important because you want the jets to mix the chemicals in the water well. Pre-measure your chemicals before you add them to your tub. Be careful not to heap the chemicals into your tub, you want to make sure you are achieving the right balance by measuring the chemicals before adding them.  Depending on the test reading, add sodium bicarbonate (spa up) or sodium bisulfate (spa down) as needed. Use your test strips- a well balanced spa should be between 80-120 PPM in total alkalinity. If the total alkalinity goes above 120, you should add sodium bisulfate (spa down). If the test strip reads below 80, add sodium bicarbonate (spa up). Add these fast-dissolving spa products to your spa, and then recheck your alkalinity in a couple of hours. It is important to maintain your alkalinity first because it affects your pH., Make sure to use test strips to maintain the correct chemical levels. Chlorine is the old standard for sanitizing your spa; however, it has been largely replaced by bromine because bromine is less harsh and has a less potent smell. chlorine can be purchased in granular form or in 1-inch tablets. You can only buy bromine in 1-inch tablets.   If you are using chlorine, put 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) directly into your spa water every other day or as recommended so that the chlorine level stays between 1.5-3 PPM.If you are using bromine ,the read on the test strips should stay between 3.0-5.0. Buy a floater for bromine or chlorine tablets. You will load 4-6 tabs into the floater, and they will dissolve in your spa over time. Using the floater, you won’t have to add bromine or chlorine to your spa as often; however, continue using the test strips to check the chemical and mineral levels in your spa once a week. Do not over sanitize your spa with chlorine. Make sure you put the appropriate level of chlorine in your spa, but do not add more than the recommended amount, because it could damage the spa's equipment and cover. Consider adding a mineral based purifier to reduce the amount of chlorine or bromine you have to use. Nature2 makes a product called Zodiac that reduces the amount of chlorine you have to use to maintain your spa.  The best way to keep the calcium hardness in your spa in check is to use soft water in your spa. If your spa has too much calcium hardness, it will cause scales to form in your spa. You can use a spa defender product to protect against these scales. On the other hand, if your spa does not have enough calcium hardness, the water will start to draw minerals from other sources, like the aluminium or iron in your equipment. In this case, use a calcium booster to balance the calcium hardness in your spa. Calcium hardness should stay between 100-250 PPM if the spa has an acrylic finish and 250-450 if the spa has a plaster finish.  Add sodium bicarbonate (spa up) or sodium bisulfate (spa down) as necessary.Your pH should stay between 7.2-7.8. If the pH is off, first work to stabilize the total alkalinity. Then make sure you have added the proper amounts of chlorine/bromine to your spa. And then if the pH is still off, add spa up/spa down or a pH balance product to your spa pH level.   Your pH levels may be adjusted if: the sanitizer you use is not working well, your spa has cloudy water, scales have developed on your filter, or the water is causing skin and eye irritations.  Put an odorizer into the water once a week, especially when there have been a lot of bathers using the spa. Odorizers kill the bather waste in your spa and keep the water clear and clean. Use Ozone as a shock treatment if you use mineral sanitizers. Use chlorine or bromine shock treatments, depending on which sanitizer you are using in your water, to shock your water once a week as well.  

use test strips to check the chemical and mineral levels in your spa.  add one chemical to your spa at a time.  check total alkalinity first.  use chlorine or bromine to sanitize your hot tub.  check for calcium hardness.  check the ph levels last.  shock your spa. 

 Many myths explain why an event occurs, how something was first created, or why people should act a certain way. Here are some examples from real myths:   Why does the moon wax and wane? Why do vultures have bald heads? Why do people prepare and eat foods in certain ways, or on certain holidays?; , Some myths explain why people should or shouldn't behave in certain ways. This can be a straightforward lesson with a moral at the end, but more often, the reader picks up on the lesson by seeing good actions rewarded, and evil or foolish actions punished. Here are a few ideas that you could use as the main focus of your work, if you like this approach:   The hero succeeds only when he follows the advice of elders or gods — or alternatively, only when he is self-reliant. The hero must be clever to succeed, solving problems in creative ways. Some myths even teach that luck can be more important than skill. It can be fun to hear about an "ordinary" person who gets rewarded, or entertaining to hear about a complete fool who somehow becomes king., Your myth can be silly or serious, but it should involve something that doesn't happen in the real world. For example, a volcano might erupt because giants underground left the barbecue on. A hero might be forced to learn to care about people after an evil serpent turns his family into trees.   If you're having trouble coming up with a mythological explanation for the topic you chose, write down a list of words that remind you of snow.If you want to explain how snowstorms happen, write down "cold, wet, white, snowman, ice cream, clouds." Maybe snowmen live in the sky and sneeze snow down to earth, or maybe the clouds try to give us ice cream that melts on the way down.  The hero of the story is usually someone impressive and admirable, although as mentioned above, you can write about an ordinary person instead. Think about these questions as you write down ideas for your hero:   Is the hero super-strong, super-intelligent, or incredibly talented in one area? Some heroes have "superpowers" such as shooting a bow with perfect aim, or the ability to knock people over with the wind from their breath. Why does your hero have these special talents, if any? Did the gods bless the hero, did the hero train hard, or was the hero just born that way? Which kind of person would you admire, or which do you think matches the real world best?  , For the sake of a good story, the hero should make mistakes sometimes. Here are some flaws you could choose from, that would cause this to happen:   The hero is overconfident, and ignores advice or turns down an offer of help. The hero is greedy or lustful, and tries to steal or take something that doesn't belong to her. The hero is arrogant, and thinks he's better than everyone else, or even better than the gods.  Witches, gods, monsters, magical items, and imaginary places all make a myth entertaining and larger than life. You could set your myth in ancient Greece, and use characters like Hades or the Chimera, or you can invent your own.   If you're out of ideas, try reading collections of actual myths, or modern books that use mythological characters. Percy Jackson and the Olympians is a good example , Myths tell a story directly, as though it were relating fact. Avoid long, wandering sentences and detailed descriptions. Don't include your own, personal opinion, and present everything as fact.   This tends to make the plot move pretty quickly. In one version of the Herakles myth, the hydra is introduced, tracked down, and killed in just eight sentences., This is easiest to do by imitating the style of real myths, but you can easily use these following writing tricks to make your myth sound traditional:   Use iconic symbols. These vary between traditions, but often include the numbers 3 and 7, animals like the raven or the seal, or characters like the prince or the trapped faerie. Use the same structure for several sentences in a row. For example: "Seven days he went up into the sky, and seven days he walked down to go to Xibalbá; seven days he was transformed into a snake ...; seven days he was transformed into an eagle."Give people a short, descriptive epithet. This is especially popular in Greek epics, which often use epithets that refer to other stories, such as "Dionysus the wolf-repeller" or "Apollo, carrier of the bay branches.", People usually know they're listening to a myth even before the first couple sentences are finished. Here are some ways you can accomplish this:   Set the myth in the distant past, or a distant land. Think of all the stories you know that begin "Once upon a time," "Far, far away," or even "A long, long time ago." Describe the kind of hero people expect in myths. For instance, a youngest brother, a king, or a woodcutter are all common heroes in folk tales. For more epic myths, start with a famous hero or a goddess instead.  You could start out describing the point of your story, explaining for instance that Coyote decided to steal fire to give to people. It's a more interesting story, however, if the character has a reason for behaving the way he does. Here are a few examples:   Coyote notices people shivering in winter, and they plead for a way to warm themselves. A queen ignores her suffering subjects. The gods send a plague to her daughter, and the queen must learn to help people in exchange for their assistance to cure her daughter.  The middle of the myth is up to you, and there are no rules you have to follow. Keep writing the story, keeping in mind the phenomenon or moral lesson you're trying to explain. If you get stuck, move the story along with one of the following:   Introduce a new character. This can be a god, a spirit, a talking animal, or an elder. The character might describe the next challenge to come and how to overcome it, or give the hero a magical item that he can use later. Create a new challenge. Just when everything is looking good again, have the hero make a mistake, or send a monster to undo the hero's good work. This is useful if you want the story to go on longer.  Continue writing until you've finished your explanation, or until the hero has defeated all the challenges and learned her lesson. Often, a myth ends with a sentence explaining why the story is related to the present day. Here are some invented examples:   "And that's why the sun gets hotter and bright every summer." "And ever since then, people brush their teeth to a shine every night, so the tooth-stealing goblins are scared by their own hideous reflection."  , Once you think your myth is almost finished, read it aloud to yourself or to a friend. Some phrases might sound better on paper than they do out loud, and myths are usually written to be shared as a spoken story. Go through it and correct spelling and grammar mistakes as well, then have a friend take a second look in case you missed something.  

decide what your myth explains.  think about including a lesson.  turn your idea into something fantastical.  create a hero.  add flaws to your hero.  brainstorm magical ideas.  write in simple, straightforward language.  write in mythological style.  introduce the setting and main character.  create a reason for the main character to do something.  continue the story.  finish the myth.  read it aloud while editing. 

 You should also analyze your collection problems first to identify whether late payments are systemic or limited to a few customers. If 80% of customers pay within 10 days before offering a discount, providing a discount would be unwise and just result in lower revenues. However, if late payments are prevalent among customers, a discount might be advantageous.  If you have ongoing needs for cash in order to make payroll and purchase raw materials, getting paid in 10 days rather than waiting 30 days will be worth offering the discount. If you have to borrow money in order to meet day-to-day expenses before you are paid, then it is definitely to your advantage to offer the discount.Some clients such as the government have rules that require paying in no less than 30 days.Set fixed policies and provide to all customers based upon the volume of business.  The customer might take the discount and still pay you at 30 days. Then you will have to make a collections call. The customer could also pay you within 10 days some months but 30 days in other months, which makes it difficult to plan your cash flow. Also if you are offering the discount every month to a number of different customers, the amount of revenue you are losing can really add up.Consider the relative strength between the vendor and the buyer. Large, national customers regularly take discounts, especially where the product or service is readily available elsewhere, and still pay late, knowing the vendor doesn't want to chase off a big client.  Factoring means selling your accounts receivable to a company in order to get immediate payment at a discounted amount. Then your customer would pay the factoring company.For example, you might have $20,000 due from one of your customers. You could sell this receivable to a factoring company for $18,000. Most factors have recourse, so the risk of non-collection remains with vendor.  

analyze cash flow and cash collection cycle.  consider the advantages of offering early payment discounts.  consider the disadvantages of offering early payment discounts.  consider factoring instead of customer discounts. 

 Although you can't increase the size of your lungs with aerobic activity or breathing exercises, you can improve their efficiency. Improved cardio-respiratory function increases the levels of oxygen that are pumped into your bloodstream, where it is transferred to your muscles to provide energy.Create additional space in your lungs by pulling up your shoulders towards the ears, while at the end of inhalation phase. Always be gentle when taking a breath, so you don't strain or injure yourself. Add weight for resistance. When lying on your back, you can increase the effort level of the an exercise by placing a book on your abdomen. Remove the book immediately if you experience any discomfort., Breathing exercises can help you gain control in stressful situations, but the best place to practice the techniques is in a safe, calm environment. As with other forms of meditation, you will be able to focus best when you are not distracted.   Practice in a dark or dimly lit room. Light candles, if you wish, to create a warm and peaceful ambience. Turn off the TV and silence the ringer on your phone. It will be easier to focus on your breathing if you are not distracted.  Breathing exercises are often more effective when you are not full. Although it can take up to four hours for food to completely pass out of the stomach, you don't need to wait for it to be completely empty. Whenever possible, wait an hour or two after the end of a meal to begin your breathing exercises., Always try to adopt a relaxed posture when doing breathing exercises, and be careful not to strain yourself. Practice at a comfortable pace – if you are struggling to hold a breath for a certain count, hold it for a lower count at first and gradually work up to it.   If you begin to hyperventilate or become light-headed, slow your breathing until you feel better and stand up slowly. If you have arthritis of the neck or any other spinal condition, check with your doctor before trying any exercises that involve moving or bending the neck or back. Never experiment with holding your breath as long as you can - this can be extremely dangerous, even fatal.  

increase your lung capacity.  create a peaceful environment.  wait an hour or two after eating.  avoid injury. 

 One of the benefits of looking for caves by digging is that you can decide where to put the entrance, picking somewhere that is convenient for you.   When choosing a location, it’s probably best to pick somewhere near your base so that you won’t have very far to travel when you’re going between your cave and your base. You can put your cave entrance inside your base if you want, and then you don’t have to go outside when you’re trying to return, which could be dangerous, particularly if you’re exiting the cave at night. If you plan on putting your cave entrance inside your base, you might want to either seal it off or mark it so that you don’t just have an open hole that you could risk falling into.  Preparing yourself to tunnel down into a cave is a little bit different than just looking for a cave. If you’re digging into one, your entrance is somewhere that you picked and is probably a lot easier to find than a naturally exposed cave entrance. This means that it will be a lot more convenient to get supplies. Instead of preparing yourself for what you’ll find in the cave, you just need to have the supplies needed to make the entrance.   Torches: Since you’ll be digging down, you’re going to run out of natural light very quickly, so it’s important that you have lots of torches so you can see what you’re doing. It’s not going to be very easy to get lost this way, but if it’s too dark you won’t be able to see if you come across any valuable materials that would be worth mining. Ladders: Ladders are made from sticks, and while they’re not the only method of getting back up once you’ve dug this hole, they are definitely the most efficient. Pickaxes: Since you’ll be coming across a lot of stone as you dig, it’s important that you have at least a couple pickaxes with you. They’ll also be important to have if you find anything to mine along your way. Shovels: While you don’t technically need shovels, there’s a good chance you’ll come across either dirt or gravel on your descent, and shovels will really speed up the process for moving those blocks.  Simply begin your descent by making sure your pickax is highlighted (or shovel if the blocks your mining are dirt) and left-clicking on the block you want to remove and holding down the left mouse button until the block is gone.   Keep in mind: you never ever want to dig straight down from the block that you’re standing on. Although it’s one of the quickest ways to tunnel downward, it’s also the most dangerous and can result in the death of your character.  If you happen to be tunneling toward a cave ceiling and you remove the block you’re standing on, you would fall and could take a lot of damage. You could also tunnel yourself into lava.   Instead of digging straight down, you’ll need to make your entrance two blocks wide. Stand on one of the blocks as you dig the other and switch back and forth. That way if you remove a block that is directly above either nothing or lava, you can stop, climb out of the hole, and find another place to dig. Put down ladders as you dig. To do this, you simply make sure that the ladder section in your toolbar is highlighted and right-click on the block where you’d like to place it. You can highlight the slot that an item is in either by scrolling to it with your mouse wheel, or pressing the number that corresponds to that slot. (If your ladders are in your third item slot for instance, you’ll want to press the 3 on your keyboard to highlight that item.)  Since you’re going to have to use ladders to get out of the hole and back to your base, it’s important that you put them down as you dig deeper and deeper. It’s easier to put them down as you’re dig than as you’re climbing, and this will also make sure you don’t run short on ladders. If you run out of ladders at any point, you should resurface and make some more before continuing your descent, as running out of ladders could get you stuck.   In addition to putting down ladders, you should also be putting down torches. It’s a good idea to put torches on the opposite wall of your ladder as this will offer the best visibility.  You won’t need to put a torch on every block, just put them down when you feel that your surroundings are getting too dark. You need to be able to see as it will help you avoid falling should you find a cave. You can easily put torches on the wall just like you would with a ladder, making sure that your torches are highlighted from your toolbar and then right-clicking where you’d like to place it.  Digging straight down like this will only lead you directly into a cave about 50% of the time. If you keep digging down all the way until you hit bedrock (which is the bottom layer and impossible to dig past) and you still haven’t found a cave, don’t worry. You haven’t wasted your time, and you can still find what you’re looking for.  Keep listening. If you hear anything as you’re climbing up and down on your ladder, it could be a sign that you’re near a cave. You can often hear monsters, water, lava, and ambiance music to let you know when you’re close. If you hear anything, you can start tunneling in the direction that it’s coming from, which should lead you to a cave. If you don’t hear any cave sounds, then the best tactic is to tunnel straight in any direction from 10–12 layers above the bedrock. Go all the way to the bottom of the hole you dug and place down 9 blocks directly beneath you. Start tunneling from there.  The reason for this is that the most valuable resources usually spawn in the layers 10–12 blocks above bedrock, so searching for a tunnel from this point will not only lead you to a cave, but it also has the best chance of leading you to a cave with gold and diamonds.    

pick a location.  gear up.  dig down.  don’t get discouraged. 

 Find your why. Everybody has one. What's yours? Are you trying to be sexy or healthy? Do you want to see your grandkids through their 20s? Do you want to fit into those jeans you wore 5 years ago? Do you have a crush on that babe at work? What is it? Isolate it. Focus on it.   You know how it goes -- "out of sight, out of mind." So if you keep this reason on the forefront of your conscious (that is, you're thinking about it all the time) you won't be able to ignore the logic behind working out. It'll be the simplest solution to getting what you want. Humans are pretty good at doing what they want -- so lining these two things up (the motivation and the action) will become easy as pie.; , You're probably telling yourself something like "I should exercise right now. If I don't work out, I'm never going to get fit." This statement has many hidden obstacles. For one thing, feeling like you should do something makes it seem like work, or an obligation. That's no fun! You're also thinking about what will happen if you don't exercise -- in other words, you're threatening yourself with punishment (the image of being unfit). Subconsciously, you're flooding your mind with negativity. Instead of thinking about how you'll look if you don't work out, think about how great you'd look if you did!   It's very important to think in the positive. Instead of, "God, I feel terrible for not working out," think "I'd feel better if I worked out -- so tomorrow I will." If you think in "nots" and "nevers" and "didn'ts," you're just bogging yourself down, making it even harder to get motivated!  , This can be at any point -- it doesn't have to be your end goal! If you want to work out twice a week, have a goal of two times a week -- simple. Then you can reward yourself after! If you want to run 10 miles (16 km) a week, have that be your goal. Smaller goals (rather than losing 50 pounds, say) bring the light at the end of the tunnel a bit nearer, making it more achievable.   Sign up for a charity walk or run that will encourage you to train. Once you have a set date to work towards, you'll have a goal in mind while you're working out. The feeling of accomplishment after you're done will encourage you to sign up for another or to just continue being fit.  What's the point in having goals if nothing is going to come from it? You gotta reward yourself! And again -- the rewards don't have to be dangled in front of you until the very end (that's just cruel); give yourself teeny rewards from time to time for sticking with it.   Make a reward for every session, every week, every pound, or every task you do/exercise/lose/complete -- whichever speaks to you. This is all about training your brain. When you see the good stuff behind all the work, it'll give you the strength to keep going and to stick with it. The other side of the coin is to make the alternatives worse. Tell yourself if you don't work out, you have to organize the attic, or call that cousin you haven't spoken to since that awkward family reunion. Now that's one threatening motivation.  You're not lazy -- this stuff is just hard. A person that runs 5 miles (8.0 km) a day doesn't get that the energy they exert is a lot less than the energy someone uses that hasn't worked out in years. So don't label yourself -- you're just starting out, that's all.   When you stumble and fall, you have to understand that that's normal. It happens to everyone. It's unimportant that you have a setback -- it's only important that you get back up. These tiny failures will happen (you'll miss a day, you'll get sick, whatever), so when they do, relax. You'll get back at it. Keep your chin up.  Hypnosis is a state of intense concentration, when your mind is extremely receptive. The "Best Me Technique" is a form of hyperempiria, or suggestion-enhanced experience, which encourages you to pre-experience the accomplishment of a goal. See the video below for more insights as to how self-hypnosis can help you get motivated to exercise.   This will only really be effective if you believe it'll be effective. If you're a skeptic, don't waste your time. Stick to more concrete endeavors.  

find your reason.  talk yourself into it.  set a goal for yourself.  set up rewards.  don't be so hard on yourself.  hypnotize yourself. 

 The first step to waking up well in the morning is getting to bed the night before. Experts say adults should aim for between six to eight hours nightly, so organize your evening activities around getting a full night sleep. Additionally, experts also recommend finishing the use of electronic devices at least an hour before bedtime to give your brain time to shut down and prepare for sleep., Other than making it difficult to attain sleep, research indicates that when we sleep or dream in mild to moderate light, we rest less and wake up feeling more depressed than we ordinarily would. This includes sleeping in light generated by TVs, computers, nightlights and streetlights, which have all have been shown to negatively impact mood of sleepers.Try a sleeping mask or blackout curtains to block out light while you sleep. Exposure to light interferes with our body's production of melatonin, which is a hormone that helps control your sleep and wake cycle.Dimming your lighting as you're preparing for bed and making your room as dark as possible can help keep your melatonin production on track., Meditation, deep breathing, or progressive muscle relaxation are ways to help calm anxiety, tension, or troublesome thoughts that might keep you awake. Try incorporating one or more of these practices into your nighttime routine.  Want to enjoy peaceful dreams and wake up in a good mood? Researchers have discovered that sleeping on your right side increases the chance that you will have positive dreams and also decreases the likelihood of mood dysfunction throughout the day. Having trouble keeping your sleep posture on the right side? Consider purchasing a body pillow. Having it on your left side will shape your sleep posture and prevent you from rolling to the left., Do you live near a busy intersection with lots of noise? Does your bedroom window face the sunrise or street lights? Purchasing light-blocking curtains and getting a white-noise device are only a few of the ways you can create a better environment for deep sleep.Install a ceiling fan. These can create white noise and also circulate air in a stuffy room. Decorate with soothing colors. Repaint if necessary. Use ambient lighting, as opposed to overhead lighting, when possible. Lamps are a good source for this, but recessed lighting inside wall molding is also an option. Dimmer switches can also create the right light level. Choose the right alarm clock. To ensure waking without shock or grogginess, consider an alarm specially designed to wake you gradually. Install an air purifier. For allergy sufferers, this is an essential and will result in vastly improved sleep quality. Consider a foam mattress. Especially if you sleep with another person, foam mattresses are great at isolating movement so it doesn't wake the other person.  Research has shown that using your bed for activities like reading or watching movies can prevent sleep and create an association with stimulation rather than rest., If you find yourself having difficulty sleeping due to worries about your day, consider keeping a journal. Earlier in the day, ask yourself "What keeps me awake at night?" and write down the things that are on your mind.Keep a notepad by your bed to record intrusive thoughts that wake you up during the night. Take stock of accomplishments. One way of helping gain closure and foster reassurance is to write down what you've accomplished during the day. Create a to-do list for the next day. Instead of lying awake, trying to remember what needs to happen tomorrow, create a list before going to bed. This helps you get closure on the current day while dialing back on the pressure to remember everything at once. Try preparing for the next day before you go to bed. Lay out your clothes, pack a lunch, and assemble everything you'll need for work or school the next morning. This can help ease stress in the morning, and you'll feel better getting into bed know it's already been done.  When your body wakes up suddenly and goes back to sleep, only to wake up again a few minutes later, it creates a kind of dissonance called "sleep inertia," which makes you feel lazy, groggy, and can persist for up to two hours after waking.Select an alarm tone that will ensure that you wake up less grumpy. To ensure that you aren't tempted to snag a few more minutes of sleep after the alarm goes off, put your alarm on a shelf or table across the room from your bed, forcing you to get up in order to turn it off.  Studies have shown that morning light between the hours of six and ten am triggers melatonin release in our brain and has an antidepressant effect, more so than later day or evening light. To ensure you get your daily dose, take a half hour to sit outside in the morning., Not only are flowers pretty to look at throughout the day, but Harvard psychologist Nancy Etcoff has discovered that women who wake up to the sight of flowers reported substantially improved mood, less anxiety, and more energy throughout the day. A nightstand arrangement of fresh or artificial flowers will brighten up your bedroom and, more importantly, serve as something positive and refreshing to wake up to., The thermogenic hypothesis argues that raising core body temperature relaxes muscles, which relieves tension, promoting an increased sense of well-being. Showering in warm water also increases circulation. Psychologists also argue that finishing your shower with a cool, five-minute rinse can duplicate some of the positive antidepressant effects of electroshock therapy, increasing brain function and the release of serotonin., Adding a few poses to your morning routine can help you feel energized and increase your ability to deal with stress throughout the day., While getting a few extra minutes of sleep is tempting, the rush required to make up for it can increase stress, lead to muscle tension, and cause us to be more forgetful than we ordinarily would. All these things have a negative impact on mood and create a negative association related to morning activities. So be sure to wake up early and tackle your morning in a well-paced, thoughtful way.  Everyone has a meaningful impact. What is yours?   Think deeply about your day—conversations with friends, favors you've done, actions taken. Think about the outcome of these actions. Do they have positive effects? If not, how could they? Change your behavior when needed so as to confidently bring a positive influence to the lives of others.  Are you good at a certain hobby or task? Do you have a good sense of humor and make other people laugh? Are you a fantastic problem-solver? Take the time to remind yourself of what you are good at and why that makes you a worthy person., Studies have shown that thinking on a "big-picture" level about your job and its meaning leads to greater overall job satisfaction and increased ability to take pleasure from the work you do., It could be something as simple as a phone call with a loved one or lunch with your coworkers. Finding daily milestones of gratification is an important way to improve overall life satisfaction and put less enjoyable tasks in perspective.  PMA is life-coach shorthand for "positive mental attitude," and it is an essential part of creating personal happiness. Having a PMA means being able to believe in good times to come despite challenges in the present. It also means remaining confident that you will surmount challenges as they present themselves. Research has shown that this is not only a means of facilitating good mental and emotional health, but a PMA can actually have a positive influence on physical health as well. Below are seven steps to develop your PMA:Focus on the present. The past can remind us of episodes of fear or regret. Use positive language. Don't gossip or put other people down. Use praise whenever possible for others and yourself.  Don't expect perfection. When we make the perfect the enemy of the good, we are never satisfied. Accept when things are not ideal and make them work anyway. Interact with positive people. Find friends who share your desire for positivity. Support each other. Do good deeds when and where you can. Something as small as paying for a stranger's coffee can make an impact. Be a learner. Don't assume you know everything. Always keep an open mind and welcome new experiences and ideas.  Be thankful. Take stock of the things in your life that matter and bring you joy. Remind yourself of your good fortune.  It is understandably difficult to tackle life's challenges when we feel that we are unworthy and lack the ability to succeed. Therefore, the first step to happiness is learning to love yourself and being able to have a positive perception of your unique qualities.Stick to the "1:1 Ratio:" Self-criticism is an important part of self-improvement. That being said, it's easy to tear down yourself esteem if you get too focused on the negative. To combat this tendency, for every negative thought you have about yourself, try to balance it with a positive observation. Give yourself the ability to succeed at something. Everyone looks for tasks that will validate their self-worth, and it is important to provide opportunities for regular success. For example, if you are having a hard week at work, find a hobby or project at home that will let you derive satisfaction from your skills and abilities.  

go to bed at a reasonable time.  don't sleep with the lights on.  clear your mind with relaxation techniques.  sleep on your right side.  design your room to be conducive to sleep.  remember that beds are for sleeping.  let go of your worries.  don't hit the snooze button.  take in morning light.  get flowers.  take a warm shower and finish with a cooling rinse.  start off with yoga or stretching.  don't rush.  find the positive.  remind yourself of the aspects of your life where you feel the most fulfilled.  view your work as meaningful.  find things to look forward to every day.  embrace pma.  build a positive self-image. 

 The home office deduction is one of the most common deductions for a filer to claim. It allows the filer to take the proportion of the house devoted to the office, subtract that portion from rent or mortgage payment, and deduct that from their income. So if your office took up half of your house, you could deduct half of your house payment from your income. But it easily raises suspicion, because it can call into question and cast doubt on many other aspects of a return. For example, say the house payment is $500/month and the filer has claimed four dependent children. On top of his children, he claims half of the house as an office. Since $500/month is a really low amount for a mortgage, an IRS agent will assume it’s a small house, and if it’s a small house, then where are all these kids staying—in the office? But then it isn’t an office, it’s a bedroom with file cabinets. If the filer needs that much office space, and he doesn’t he seem to make much money from office-related work, he could be underreporting that income.  It’s also common for people to claim mileage in a car as a business expense. It’s a permissible deduction, but also one that’s easily open to abuse, so it’s scrutinized pretty carefully. To satisfy any suspicions, put a mileage log in the car and update it every time you take a trip.For instance, if the “business vehicle” is the person’s only vehicle, it’s really hard to tell when business stops and pleasure begins, so they’ll want to investigate it—which can trigger an audit.  When travel, entertainment, and meals are for business purposes, they are deductible, but this is another area which is open to abuse, and therefore scrutinized heavily. If you claim more than $1000 per year in entertainment, you need to be very diligent about keeping track of the receipts and records. , The IRS actually has statistical models of charitable giving divided up into income brackets, so they would know about how much a typical single man making $40,000 per year would donate to charity. So if you donate much more than your usual amount, or much more than the amount a typical person of your situation would give, that’s going to invite a closer look.In order to protect yourself, make sure you make your charitable contributions via check and not cash.  If you claim more than a third of your income in itemized deductions, be prepared for an audit. It's an IRS red flag. Very few people could legitimately claim that amount of deductions, but even if they were all legitimate, it indicates a great degree of calculation on the part of the tax preparer. The level of calculation that allows a person to claim half of their income in itemized deductions invites suspicion. 

keep your home office in good working order.  buy a mileage log and keep it in your car.  be conservative about meal and entertainment deductions.  make your charitable contributions by check.  don’t go overboard with itemized deductions. 

 Sun exposure causes several skin problems like age spots and wrinkles. Try to minimize sun exposure so that your skin looks refreshed in the morning.   Use sunscreen religiously. SPF of 15 or more is recommended. Remember to reapply regularly, especially if you’re exercising.Find shade during the hottest points of the day. Try not to be in the sun during the middle of the day. Seek shelter and keep your skin looking young and healthy. Be delicate with your skin. Don’t use abrasive soaps or chemicals when cleaning. Be sure to shave with the grain rather than against it. Follow up cleaning by patting dry instead of rubbing harshly., Retinoids are in products like Renova, Retin-A, Tretinoin, and some over-the-counter items. They help fight acne, lines, spots, and freckles, as well as boosting the collagen., There are a variety of ways you can use makeup to either benefit or hurt your skin. Try a few of the tips below to make your skin look better while still using makeup.   Clean your makeup brushes regularly. Some studies have shown a majority of women don’t clean the bacteria-collecting brushes. Clean the brushes once a week with warm water and a bit of facial cleanser.Remove your makeup before you go to sleep. Keeping makeup on overnight can cause yeast growth, rashes, and bumps called milia cysts. Use an oil-free cleanser to wipe your skin clear of makeup.Stay free from oil-based makeup. Most people have some spots of oily skin, and adding an oil-based makeup can lead to multiple problems. Alleviate clogged pores, extra blemishes, and acne by staying away from products with extra oil., Unclean pores can get clogged and appear larger. Clear out the dirt and oil by exfoliating with a light brush and facial cleanser every night., They protect your skin and even it out, hiding blemishes in the process., Try a few of the following solutions: Tea bags, spoons, or cucumbers. Moist, cool tea bags possess tannin, which helps reduce puffiness. To use spoons or cucumbers, place them in the refrigerator for a few hours before using. The temperature difference will work like small ice packs, reducing inflammation and pain. Apply your preferred remedy for a few minutes.  

take care of your skin.  include a small amount of retinoids into your skin care routine.  change your makeup practices.  exfoliate your skin.  apply moisturizer after your nightly shower.moisturizers work on all types of skin: normal, dry, oily, and sensitive.  get rid of the dark circles under your eyes. 

 If your partner’s parents disrespect you, speak up and ask your partner to defend you. If your partner loves you, they should not allow their parents to act rudely or mean towards you. However, because it’s their parents, they may feel uncomfortable speaking up.   Although your spouse shouldn’t allow any talking behind your back, you should also avoid telling your partner to choose sides. Doing so puts them in an impossible position. Try to understand where your partner is coming from, but also ask that they don’t allow their parents to speak badly about you.Try to come up with some respectful but firm responses for your partner to use to defend you. These statements should be strong enough to defend you without insulting your partner’s parents.  You and your partner are a team, so talking about how to battle this together is ideal. Supporting each other is crucial during this hardship, and if you’re in it for the long haul, this may be something you have to deal with for a very long time. Come up with a plan and then do your best to implement it.   For instance, decide that you will both not hold what the parents do against each other. Also, agree to let go of anything negative the parents do as quickly as possible. This will allow you to move on with your lives and be happy without holding grudges. Lastly, decide to always be honest with each other about the things that upset you. Doing this can help the both of you understand where the other is coming from and possibly avoid bad situations., One of the biggest barriers to healthy communication is the way you and your partner listen to one another. Too often, people listen with the intention of replying; they don't listen to understand. When you follow some basic principles of active listening you and your partner can get on the same page and strengthen your bond in the process.   Make occasional eye contact. Use open body language with your body turned toward them and your arms and legs relaxed at your sides. Share your feelings using "I" statements like "It makes me feel very small when your mom acts like I'm trash because I don't come from a wealthy family like yours. I really wish you would stand up for me." By focusing on your feelings, you will be giving your partner a chance to come to their own conclusions regarding their parents’ behavior. Now, give your partner an opportunity to respond. They might say, "I'm sorry you feel that way, baby. My mom is very arrogant when it comes to money and status..." Give your partner the chance to fully express their message and provide a summary afterwards, like "It sounds like you're saying your mom does that with other people, too?" Make sure you have fully received their message before providing your own response., In-laws have the power to make or break your relationship, but only if you allow it. At the end of the day, you can't force your partner's parents to like you. However, you and your partner can make sure this doesn't negatively impact your relationship by presenting as a unified front. When you come off as a team, the in-laws are less likely to challenge you.   Stand together about your principles and don't fold when they apply pressure. For instance, if you have already expressed a boundary that you will be visiting one family for Thanksgiving and one family for Christmas, don't even consider it if one family tries to negotiate this boundary. Simply have your partner say, "Mom, Dad, we already told you our travel plans for the holidays. Please respect our decision." In addition, to being united when together, you should also maintain unity when apart. Both you and your partner should clarify what is shared with the family and what is kept between you. When you are in their presence, stand true to this in to send the message that both partners respect and value one another's privacy and decisions. 

tell your partner it’s important to defend you.  talk with your partner about what you can do together.  practice active listening.  stand as a unified front. 

 Heart attacks can produce similar symptoms to a mitral valve prolapse. Because untreated heart attacks can be fatal, you should call an ambulance at the first suspicion of a heart attack. Heart attack symptoms may include some or all of the following:Chest pain or pressure Pain that radiates to your neck, jaw, or back Nausea Abdominal discomfort Heartburn or indigestion Feeling out of breath, rapid or shallow breathing Sweating Exhaustion Lightheadedness or dizziness; , If you have symptoms, they may be slight at first and increase slowly. If the prolapse causes blood to leak back into the atrium (a condition called mitral valve regurgitation), you are more likely to have symptoms. This can increase in the amount of blood in the left atrium, create more pressure in the pulmonary veins, and cause the heart to become enlarged. If your condition is severe, you may have:Chest pain An arrhythmic heartbeat A racing heartbeat Difficulty breathing during exercise and when lying flat Exhaustion  , The doctor will use a stethoscope to listen to how the blood flows through your heart. When diagnosing a mitral valve prolapse, your doctor will consider:Whether there is a clicking sound as the valve shuts. If so, this suggests that the valve is bulging or prolapsing. Whether you have a heart murmur. If the valve is leaking, your doctor may hear a whooshing sound as the blood goes backwards into the atrium. Your medical history. If you or someone in your family has another condition that is associated with a mitral valve prolapse, you may be prone to it as well. These conditions include: Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Ebstein’s anomaly, muscular dystrophy, Graves’ disease, and scoliosis.  Your doctor may need additional information to diagnose you. There are several tests that he or she may do to measure and take images of your heart. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, nursing, or think you could be pregnant because that may influence which tests the doctor does.Echocardiogram. This exam uses sound waves to create a picture of your heart. The doctor can see if your heart is enlarged and examine the mitral valve. This test is likely to be done by putting a transducer through your mouth and into your esophagus. The esophagus is right near your heart so your doctor will be able to get high quality images. The doctor may also measure the blood flow and determine if you have leakage with a Doppler ultrasound at the same time. An electrocardiogram (ECG). This test measures the intensity and pacing of the electrical signals that control your heartbeat. The doctor will put electrodes on your skin. It is noninvasive and will not hurt. Stress test. If you do a stress test you will exercise on a treadmill or bike during an ECG. This lets your doctor examine how your heart performs under stress. If you cannot exercise, your doctor may give you a medication to make your heart beat faster, simulating exercise. If you have leakage through the mitral valve that makes it hard for you to be physically active, this test will show that. A chest X-ray. X-rays can show the doctor the size and shape of your heart. It is particularly useful in identifying areas that might be enlarged. You will not feel the X-rays, but you may need to wear a heavy lead apron to protect your reproductive organs during this procedure. Coronary angiogram and cardiac catheterization. The doctor puts a small catheter into a vein or artery, usually in your groin, and then moves the catheter through your body to your heart. The doctor then introduces dye into the blood vessels of your heart so they will show up on an X-ray. This test can be used to determine how much blood is leaking through the mitral valve.  Your doctor may not recommend treatment if you have no leakage through the mitral valve and no symptoms.If you have some leakage but no symptoms, your doctor may suggest monitoring your condition rather than using medications or surgery to treat it. If you chose this course of action, be sure to attend follow up appointments as advised by your doctor.  Most of the time dietary or exercise changes aren’t necessary. However, if the leakage through your mitral valve is significant, your doctor may recommend that you avoid activities that increase the blood pressure on the mitral valve. If the valve is weak, you may be at an increased risk of a rupture.Your doctor may suggest that you avoid weight lifting with heavy weights. Your doctor will probably have no objection to other activities such as running, biking and swimming.  Which medications your doctor recommends will depend on what symptoms you have, the severity, and your medical history. Medications will not prevent the prolapsed from happening, but they may reduce chest pain or stabilize a heart arrhythmia. Possible medications include:Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. These are common high blood pressure medications for mild mitral valve regurgitation.Anticoagulants such as aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), dabigatran (Pradaxa). Blood clots can cause strokes and heart attacks. The doctor is particularly likely to prescribe them if you have previously had either of these conditions. Diuretics. These medications can reduce the burden on the mitral valve by lowering your blood pressure.They will also help to remove fluid that may be building up in your lungs.Beta blockers. Beta blockers reduce the rate at which your heartbeats and lower the amount of force with which it beats. This reduces your blood pressure, decreases the strain on your mitral valve, and can help inhibit irregular heartbeats. Medications to control your heartbeat. If you have an irregular heartbeat, your doctor may recommend flecainide (Tambocor), procainamide (Procanbid), sotalol (Betapace), or amiodarone (Cordarone, Pacerone).  This procedure enables you to keep your valve instead of replacing it. Be sure to go to someone who is experienced and specializes in mitral valve repair. Depending upon the cause of your prolapse and / or leakage the doctor may do several things:Annuloplasty. If you have structural problems with the tissue around the valve, it can be reinforced by implanting a ring around the valve or tightening the tissue. Valvuloplasty. This involves doing surgery on the tissues of the valve. It might involve making the flaps, or leaflets, that close smaller so they close snugly. It could also involve modifying the attachments of the flaps.  This would be done if it isn’t possible to repair the valve you have. There are two options for replacing your valve and each have pros and cons:A bioprosthesis. This is a tissue valve, usually made of a valve from a cow or pig. The major advantage is that it does not require you to take anticoagulants for the rest of your life. However, the disadvantage is that it may wear out and have to be replaced. A mechanical valve. Mechanical valves have the advantage that they last longer. The disadvantage is that blood clots may form on the valve and then get dislodged. This means that people with mechanical valves have to take anticoagulants for the rest of their lives to reduce their risk of strokes.  

call an ambulance if you could be having a heart attack.  go to the doctor if you have symptoms of mitral valve prolapse.  let your doctor listen to your heart.  get additional tests if you doctor says it’s necessary.  ask your doctor if treatment is necessary.  avoid activities that may burden your mitral valve.  control your symptoms with medications.  have the mitral valve repaired.  replace a valve that is beyond repair. 

 When you're sad, avoid isolating yourself. Make sure to connect with your friends and family regularly. That doesn't mean you need to host big parties, but rather be with people who are supportive and caring, even in smaller ways.When you're feeling sad, reach out to a friend or family member by phone. Choose people who you think will be good listeners and provide reassurance. Ask friends to hang out after work or on the weekends. Invite a small group or just one good friend to do something fun. Visit with relatives more. There may be other family members who are going through a hard time too. Reach out to them.; , Spending time with people who have common interests can help you feel less sad or alone. Think about the things that interest you personally. There may be clubs, social groups, or sports leagues available that you can join for free or low cost.Check out Meetup.com for groups and activities. There is often a diverse collection of activities available, and new people to meet. Identify clubs that may relate to your interests or background. Search online or check out community centers in your area. There may be runner's clubs or mom's clubs out there.  There are many people who feel socially isolated or wish they could be connected more to others in their community. Consider meeting up with a neighbor or reaching out to community centers about activities in your area.Meet up with an elderly neighbor who may also be feeling isolated or sad. Offer to help them or invite them over for dinner. Connect with your local place of worship. Churches and synagogues, for example, are places where people can feel safe to express their joy and their sadness. There may be a bible study group or another group that appeals to you. Go to your neighborhood community center or a YMCA for information about programs and activities. There are often many activities for people of all ages--kids, teens, adults, and older adults.  Volunteering can be socially empowering and personally enriching. There are many organizations and non-profits that need volunteers. Identify places that may interest you, and connect with a volunteer coordinator for more information about how to help.When you decide you'd like to volunteer, don't over commit yourself. Start with possibly helping out a few hours after work or school, or for part of a weekend. Some volunteer opportunities request regular volunteers, while others just to need volunteers during the holidays or for occasional events throughout the year. Consider choosing activities where you can directly connect with others such as after-school tutoring programs, volunteering at a hospital or retirement facility, or delivering meals through Meals on Wheels.  

spend time with friends and family.  join an activity club.  connect with people in your community.  volunteer. 

 Whatever you choose to put in them, it is always a good idea to label the jars so you can remember what you repurposed them for. Labels can be purchased from an office supplies store, printed from a label maker, or you can simply make your own from paper and tape! If you intend to permanently label a jar, you can also use a stencil and paint your label on directly.  Each jar can be used to hold a different type of hardware. For example, they could be used to separate woodscrews from bolts and keep different types of wire distinct from one another. These jars could be kept in a tray to prevent them from rolling around, though you could also attach them to the underside of a shelf.   To do so, just sink a nail or screw through the lid into the underside of the shelf and tightly secure it. When you are done using the jar, simply tighten the jar back onto the designated lid.  Objects like pencils, pens, and paintbrushes can also be stored in jars, just without using the lid. The naturally heavy weight of glass jars makes them more ideal for this situation than a lighter container like a plastic cup. This method still runs the risk of tipping over and spilling the contents, but this can be avoided by either adding weight to the bottom of a jar or not storing too many items in it at a time.   Jars can also be used to store safety pins, thumbtacks, staples, paper clips, and similar supplies. The advantage to storing them in a jar is that, once sealed, they cannot spill or become mixed with other supplies.  The inside of the jar can be dedicated for housing your many spools of thread while the lid can be repurposed into a pincushion. Mason jars are ideal for the pin cushion lid because the main part of the lid pops out and leaves only the rim. To make a pin cushion lid, you’ll need a large circle of fabric, some stuffing, and a small circle of cardboard traced from the inside of the Mason jar.   Run a needle and thread through the edges of your fabric circle. Then pull the two ends of the string like a drawstring and tighten the cloth around your stuffing. Glue your cardboard circle over the opening of your cloth bundle and then push it through the Mason jar lid from the underside. Once sealed onto the jar, this will hold your pin cushion in place and you can stick your sewing needles into the top.  Instead of losing or throwing out your spare change, keep it in a jar instead. Dedicate the money saved to your date or movie fund and label the jar accordingly. It may take a while, but this idea will pay for itself.  Candle holders are easy to make. Just situate the candle upright in the bottom of the jar and light it. Leave the lid off so that the candle has enough oxygen to continue burning. When you want the candle to stop burning, you can either blow the candle out or seal the jar and wait a few moments for the flame to run out of oxygen.  Potpourri is made by combining dried flower petals, herbs, barks, spices, and fragrance oils. Combine the spices and oils together, then pour over the remaining ingredients in a bowl. After storing in a dark, dry place for 4-8 weeks, the potpourri is ready to be displayed. At that point, just pour the potpourri into a jar, arranging it in whatever fashion you find most appealing, then place wherever you want the scents to be strongest.  

label your jars.  keep hardware organized and separated.  organize office supplies on your desk.  store sewing needles and thread.  save your spare change.  make a candle holder.  make a potpourri holder. 

 While you may be able to use this article as a guide to help you figure out if you are injured, you still must go to the doctor to get a professional diagnosis. It would be bad to think that you are ok, only to put pressure on your knee and injure it further.   Schedule an appointment for as soon as possible after the injury. If you can, you may also go to the hospital to deal with the injury right away.  When your ACL gets injured, it is referred to as a sprain rather than a broken bone because it is a ligament (though it can feel as painful as breaking a bone). The term 'sprain' refers to more than just the stretching of the ligament, it is actually the classification the is used to refer to ligament injuries. There are three levels of ACL injury.   A grade 1 ACL sprain involves mild injury to the ligament. It has been slightly stretched but not torn. It can still sustain the knee joint and will help the leg remain stable. A grade 2 ACL sprain is when the ligament is stretched beyond its capacity to the point it becomes loose. This is when the technical term “partial tear of the ACL” is used. A grade 3 ACL sprain makes the knee joint unstable and the ligament is completely torn apart.  You must have a doctor do this test—do not try it yourself. This is the preferred test for figuring out if you have a partial ACL tear because it can show that you have a partial tear even when the rest of the ligaments and tendons in your knee are uninjured. A doctor will:   Have you lie down on a table. Your doctor will first look at your uninjured knee to see how far your shin moves forward when your knee is bent. Your ACL keeps your shin from moving very far forward. Your doctor will then look at your injured knee and see how far your shin moves forward when the knee is bent. If it moves forward further than normal but your doctor can still feel resistance, it means that you have a partial tear. If there is no resistance, your ACL has been fully torn.  This test is meant to determine how much pressure can be put on your injured knee before it becomes unstable. Your doctor will move your injured leg a little ways away from your body (this is called hip abduction).She will then:   Straighten your leg while simultaneously press inward against the outer part of your knee and twist your leg outward. Doing this will show how well your ACL is functioning because it is a movement that only involves the ACL. Your leg will be slowly bent while continuous pressure is put on it. When your knee is bent at a 20 to 40° angle, your doctor will look at your shin bone. If the bone slides forward a bit it means that your ACL has been partially torn.  While the ACL cannot be seen through an x-ray, your doctor can look for other evidence that you ACL has been partially torn. An x-ray of both knees is necessary to detect signs of injury such as fracture, improper alignment of the bony structures, and narrowing of the spaces between joints.All three of these injuries are associated with a partial ACL tear.  Unlike an x-ray, an MRI will help your doctor to examine your soft tissue structures in your knee, including your ACL. Your doctor will also look at your meniscus and other knee ligaments to make sure that they are not injured.   Your doctor might also request an oblique coronal image if he or she is still not sure about the extent of your injury. This image will give the doctor a better view of your knee in addition to the MRI.  

go to a doctor if you notice any of the symptoms listed in this article.  be aware that there are three grades of acl injury.  have a doctor perform the lachman test.  be prepared for the pivot shift test.  have an x-ray taken of your knee.  know that an mri might need to be done. 

 Doing a variety of exercises, from cardio to strength training, will help you get your body in shape to play volleyball effectively. Plan to exercise for an hour 4-5 times per week.   Consult with your physician before starting any exercise program.  Having a strong upper body is essential so that you are able to block and spike the ball with force. Do exercises that build muscle strength in your chest, shoulders, arms and core, such as rowing, bench pressing and push pressing. Doing core strengthening exercises, such as Pilates, will also help.  Training your leg muscles will help you jump higher with more force. Do squats, deadlift weight training, and other strength training for your legs 2-3 times a week., Your muscles will need breaks from intense training that you will do, so be sure to schedule days off to allow your body to recover. Have an intense training day on Friday, for example, and give yourself rest days on the weekend.  Being well rested will replenish your energy level every day so that you are ready to give it your all on the court. Get about 7-8 hours of sleep every night, and 1-2 additional hours per night if you are a teenager.  Feed your body with foods rich in nutrients and vitamins. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, along with protein and whole grains. Avoid refined sugars and refined carbohydrates.  Keep your body hydrated, especially when you are exercising rigorously every day. Before you exercise, drink an extra 25-30 ounces of water, and then drink 8 ounces of water for every 15 minutes you exercise.

 Cold or stormy weather can worsen conditions like arthritis. Just prior to the start of winter or a cooler season, take your dog to the vet, especially if your dog is older or has a history of arthritis or other joint issues. Ask the vet for any necessary medications or advice about your dog’s specific needs., When keeping your dog warm during extreme cold, think about how comfortable you’d be in a given temperature for a prolonged period of time. If you wouldn’t be comfortable outside, it’s probably too cold for your dog.Try to avoid long walks during extreme cold. Consider taking your dog out more frequently if it’s an active breed and requires a significant amount of exercise, but limit walks to around 15 minutes. If you do let your dog play in the yard during cold weather, make sure it can access a draft-free shelter. Provide an insulated doghouse, and cover its floor with wood shavings, hay, or a blanket., Avoid longer walks during extreme cold, especially if you have a short-haired dog. Clothe your short-haired dog before going outside in a breed-specific, snugly fitting garment. While being sure it fits well enough to provide warmth, make sure it doesn’t restrict your dog’s movement.It’s best to avoid sweaters or jackets with full sleeves, as these get in the way of a dog’s natural gait.  Cold temperatures can lead to cracked or irritated paws, so check them daily during cold spells. Use a wet towel to wipe your dog’s paws and belly after each walk to remove salt or chemical deicers, then dry these areas off using another towel.Consider applying petroleum jelly or using booties to keep your dog’s paws free from irritation and help prevent salt or chemical buildup.  Bathing a dog too frequently during periods of cold weather can remove oils necessary for keeping its skin and coat healthy. This can lead to dry, flaky, and irritated skin.Bathe your dog only when absolutely necessary during extreme cold. Consider investing in a moisturizing shampoo if you do need to give it a bath. Ask your dog’s vet if they recommend a moisturizing cream or rinse if you notice your dog scratching excessively or see flakes or red patches.  

take your dog to the vet for a cold weather wellness exam.  avoid leaving your dog outside in cold temperatures.  give your a short-haired dog a sweater for walks.  check your dog’s paws for injury and deicers.  bathe your dog less frequently during the cold. 

 These are relatively inexpensive and require a minimum time commitment. These are a good idea even if you don’t intend to become fully qualified as they will allow you to be given greater responsibly and show your commitment to your equine education. If you do intend to become fully qualified you may be able to take a lower qualification within the same route or get an exemption.  They offer internationally recognized progressive exams. Gaining the highest will often mean an exemption on a professional course.  If they are affiliated they may offer exams similar to those of the Pony Club.

 The fragrance will make your flower bed smell fresh and citrus-like, and has the added advantage that it will also repel cats.  This will help you to avoid a spillage of the lemons.  This will form the rigid body of the scarecrow. Squeeze some citrus fruits into a bucket (orange, lime, lemon) and paint the juices onto the board to repel cats; the juices will enhance the repellent effect.  Roughly three-quarters of the way up the body of the scarecrow, horizontally place another shorter plank. Repeat the previous step if you want to add more effect.  Leave old clothes in the bucket overnight so that the fabric can absorb the leftover juices, and dress the scarecrow in the morning.  It's a good idea to refresh the lemons and scent every few weeks.  

fill a sack with half-cut lemons.  tie the sack up with a rope.  stick a tall plank into the tied-up opening of the bag.  make the scarecrow's arms.  make the citrus clothes.  let the lemon scarecrow due its scaring off work. 

 Ask yourself what you like about your current style, and what needs work. Look at the letters that make up your name, and think about how you can best emphasize them: note the interesting letters (with a lot of loops, dots, and crosses, like G, X, or B) and the plain letters (especially those that look similar between uppercase and lowercase, like S or O). Look for any areas that could become focal points of your signature.; , A simple and clear signature will be easier for people to read, but a more complex signature might show more flair. The more flourish you put into your signature, the more flamboyant you may seem. Consider how your signature might speak to the luxury of time. Busy doctors often scrawl hasty, illegible signatures, whereas famous writers often take the time to orchestrate intricate designs.Signatures that include just your initials (with or without the middle initial) are usually considered more formal and businesslike than full-name signatures. If you’re worried about forgery, consider making your signature longer and more legible. Include your entire first and last name. Be sure to write clearly. It is easier to forge scribbled signatures than it is to copy the nuances of a practiced, legible signature.  Some people sign their full name, and some sign only their first or last name. Some just use their initials. If you are known only by your first or last name—like Beyonce or Ronaldo— then you might consider using just the first name. If you are a professor who typically goes by their last name, you may just sign your surname.  Look at the signatures of famous people, and consider whether you want to emulate anybody. Kurt Vonnegut, Walt Disney, Salvador Dali, Picasso, and John Hancock (among many others) are all known for their unique signature styles. Don't be afraid to borrow eye-catching elements and add them to your own signature., Rewrite your signature over and over to explore the possibilities. Have fun with it. Play with a variety of styles and flourishes. See what feels comfortable to write, looks good with your name, and isn’t too hard to copy repeatedly. Use a writing tool that feels right in your hand. Consider using pencil if you want to erase and rework your signature.  Make a letter larger so that it stands out, or make it very small so that it blends in. This can give your signature a bold look without slowing your signing time down to a crawl. Try exaggerating the first letter of your name, or the first letters of your first and last name.If your signature is messy or curly, you can emphasize one letter by making it sharp and clear. Likewise, make a single letter sloppy or fancy if you want it to stand out from an otherwise clean-cut signature.  This is a classic way to make your name look more ornate. Underlining can also take more time to write out than a simpler style – so consider whether it's worth it.   Turn one of your letters into an underline. This is commonly done with the last letter, but feel free to add a flourish to any letter that lends itself to the style. Letters with a long tail (y, g, j) are perfect. Drag the tail out beneath the signature. Underline your signature with loops. This is a very fluid, ornate way to spice up a signature.Underline your signature with zig-zags. These are similar to loops, but spikier and more angular.  Double up on your horizontal crosses, and end your looped letters in hooks and flourishes. Use a fountain pen, if possible. Draw inspiration from calligraphy, from old signatures, and from Gothic lettering. This adds flair to even a simple signature.  This can be a great way to make your style more unique. Look for letters that lend themselves to an exciting twist, and experiment with ways to make them look fancier. Try the following ideas:   Use repeating elements. The three large ovals in this signature create an echo effect and help tie the whole design together. Allow your capital letters to encircle the lowercase letters. This is a useful way to spice up a name that doesn’t have any lower loops (g, j, etc.) to play with. Encircle the signature with loops. This creates a very regal, official-looking signature. Enlarge the bottoms of your letters. This is one of the simplest and most common ways to spruce up a signature.  The symbols might include a team jersey number, a simple sketch, or a graduation year. If you associate a specific number or symbol with your identity (for instance, if you are well-known for your role on a sports team), this may be a good way to publicly distinguish yourself from people with similar names. If you want to go this route, it’s best to keep the rest of your signature straightforward to save time. Too many symbols can overwhelm the design and make for a long signing process.  Find pieces of signatures that you like. Consider what works, what doesn't, and what suits your personality. As you practice your signature, tweak small details and flourishes until you've come up with something that feels right.  Don't pick a signature only because it looks cool. Choose a signature that is stylistic, but also practical.   Your signature should be easy to write and reproduce. It should feel good coming off of your hand, and it should be simple enough that you can dash it off in a matter of seconds. Your signature should suit your purpose and personality. If you want to show your dramatic side, use a signature with flair. If you want to tell people that you are neat and ordered, your signature should reflect that. Your signature should be identifiable. It shouldn't just look like a scribble on the page – unless it's a recognizable scribble, and it comes out like that every time. Make your signature unique so that people know it's yours.  Remember that you can always change it, up to a point. If you use a certain signature on all of your legal documents (driver's license, passport, credit card, bank records) then it may be inconvenient to change it. In some cases, your signature actually serves to identify you, and you may arouse suspicion if you sign in a way that doesn't match the records.  The coolest, most complicated signature in the world is useless if you can't quickly sign it onto new documents. As you practice your signature, think about practicality: consider how fast you can sign it, whether you need any special writing tools, and whether you can make it look the same each time. If you can't easily reproduce your signature, you might want to simplify your design.   Bear in mind that this does not apply to digital signatures. Most digital document-signing applications will save your personalized signature for later use. Sign it right once, and you can copy it to any future document. However. it may be wise to keep your digital signature consistent with your analog signature. 

read over your current signature.  consider what you want your signature to say about you.  think about which parts of your name you want to include.  draw inspiration from other signatures.  experiment.  emphasize certain letters.  underline your signature for emphasis.  use "old-timey" lettering.  add flourishes to spice up your signature.  add numbers or symbols to your signature.  combine your favorite elements into one signature.  know when it feels right.  practice your new signature until writing it feels natural.  make sure that you can easily replicate the new signature. 

 Pour the liter of water through a carbon water filter. You can find filter pitchers at most grocery and specialty stores. The carbon filter takes out substances like chlorine, which are added to the water and could affect the salinity.       ; , You now have sterilized water. Let it cool down a little before using. You can also choose to buy distilled water from a supermarket.  of sea salt for every 1 l (4.2 cups) of warm water. This will be equivalent to about 1 heaping tsp. of salt. The warmth of the water will help it dissolve.          You want to make an isotonic solutions. This means that the solution you are making is similar to the salt levels in your body.

Maybe you can't get past the beginning or one particularly difficult part. If you've been hitting your against the problem for awhile now, try working on a different section. It may give you a chance to come up with a solution for the part you're having trouble with., Sometimes, when you've been working on a problem for hours, it's time to a take a break. If you can go do something else for awhile, it gives your brain a chance to work through the problem without actively beating against it.Try exercise for your break. It gets your body moving and gives your brain something to do, but it also doesn't overtax it, allowing it to still work on the problem in the background., You can't always just sit inside when you're trying to create. You have to refill yourself with things that make you curious or that interest you. When you spend time away from your project, make sure to observe what's going on around you., Freewriting or free-drawing can help you get over your creative slump. Basically, you just take out a piece of paper and start writing whatever comes into your head. For free drawing, just start doodling. While these techniques work best for writers and artists, they do have some crossover power, meaning anyone can use them to get your creative juices flowing.One way to jump start your creativity is to try a different kind of creative activity. For instance, you're a writer, try doing some painting to help get you out of your slump.  You can't finish a project if you don't keep working on it. Sometimes, persistence is more important than raw talent. Keep working at it until you finish what you want to do., Sometimes talking through a problem, even to yourself, can help you get past your creative slump. It can help if you record what you're saying, so you'll have notes for later. 

get your juices flowing early.  work on a different part.  give your brain some time to solve it.  find things that inspire you.  use a creative exercise.  keep going.  talk out loud. 

 To use heat to help open the coconut, it’s important to ensure that your oven is warm enough. Set the temperature to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat., Put the drained coconut on a baking sheet, and set it in the oven. Allow the coconut to bake for approximately 10 minutes or until you see a crack develop in the shell.If the coconut hasn't cracked after 10 minutes, continue to bake it until you notice that the shell is starting to split. Check the coconut every few minutes, though, to ensure that you don't heat it longer than necessary. If you’re in a hurry, you can also microwave the coconut. Place it on a microwave-safe plate, and heat it on medium-high power for three minutes., When the coconut has started to crack, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Allow it to cool for two to three minutes. Next, wrap the coconut in a small kitchen towel or rag., With the coconut still wrapped in the towel, set it inside a large plastic garbage bag. Twist the bag closed, and whack the coconut against a hard surface several times until you feel it break into pieces.The harder the surface that you hit the coconut against, the easier it will be to break. A concrete surface works especially well.  When the coconut is broken into pieces, remove it from the garbage bag and unwrap the towel. Take each piece, and wedge a knife between the shell and the white meat of the coconut to carefully separate the two.You don’t necessarily have to use a sharp knife to separate the coconut meat and shell. It’s best to start with a butter knife and only move onto a sharp knife if you’re having trouble. Steady the pieces of coconut as you’re separating the coconut shell and meat by bracing it against your table or counter.  After you’ve separated the coconut, there may still be some light brown fiber covering the white meat. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the fiber as you would the skin from a potato or other vegetable. Once you’ve removed the fiber from the meat, you’re ready to eat or cook with your coconut.If you don’t have a vegetable peeler, you can use a sharp knife to carefully peel away the fiber from the meat.  

preheat the oven.  place the coconut on a pan and bake it for 10 minutes.  remove the coconut and wrap it in a towel.  place the coconut in a garbage bag and hit it against a hard surface.  place a knife between the shell and meat to separate them.  peel the fiber away from the coconut meat. 

 Whip the cream well in a large bowl until stiff peaks form. Set aside.  Mix with an electric mixer until well-combined.  Blend once more until properly combined. , Scrape all of it out using a rubber spatula., Add it onto the mixture., Gently swirl the colors around using a kebab skewer or butter knife, giving the effect of the red and blue colors. Sprinkle over the white disco dust.  Don't stir the colors - this will mix them together and ruin the effect. You want to run the skewer or knife through the colors in a straight line, rather than in a circular motion.  Spread it around with a butter knife until smooth and even.,, Scoop the ice cream on an ice cream cone, a sundae glass, or serving bowl. Garnish with patriotic stars, extra disco dust, or whipped cream. Enjoy!

 Any cosmetic surgery has a number of things that can go wrong, and you should weigh those risks against the value of permanently reducing the size of your lip(s).Complications from anesthesia exist in most surgeries, ask your surgeon or anesthesiologist about them. There is a risk of infection in and around the operating site--and the lip/mouth area is already a high risk area. Excessive bleeding or internal damage resulting in more operations can result. Nerve damage, temporary or permanent, can result--necessitating more operations, leaving the area numb, or in pain. Scarring can occur in the operating area, resulting in more operations to remove the affected skin.  This procedure needs to be performed by a American Board of Plastic Surgery (ABPS) certified surgeon. This surgeon is also the doctor who will evaluate if you are a candidate for the procedure.The surgeon will review your medical history, make a clinical assessment of your lips, discuss concerns, and go over the procedure. If the surgeon recommends the procedure, they will explain its details, costs, risks, and recovery to you. During the 1-hour long procedure, the surgeon will give you local anesthetic or more complete oral sedation. Then they will make an incision along the length of the lip inside the mouth, remove a strip of tissue, and stitch the cut closed. The cost of lip reduction surgery can range from $1,500 to $4,000, and because it is considered entirely cosmetic, is usually not covered by insurance.  Soreness, tightness, and pain are common sensations to feel after lip reduction surgery. Your surgeon may provide recovery instructions and prescribe painkillers to help alleviate the discomfort.Avoid vigorous exercise. Sleep with your head elevated, perhaps with a couple of pillows under your head. Avoid highly acidic/citrus foods. Eat softer and pureed foods for the recovery period. Rinse with antiseptic mouthwash to fight infection at the incision site. The sutures should be removed within a week-to-ten days of the procedure if all goes well. Most of the irritation or swelling should have subsided by then. If there are any signs of excessive pain, bleeding, or unexpected side effects, report it to your surgeon or doctor immediately. 

familiarize yourself with the risks.  learn about the lip reduction procedure itself.  know the recovery procedure.  finished.  

 List the person's names, starting with the full proper name of the person. If the person goes by nicknames, write those down as well. If you know their birth names or married names, note those.   Record the person's age or approximate age. Write down the last known address that you have for the person. Add anything you have come across that may indicate that the person is now in another geographic location. For example, a former neighbor may provide information that the person left Massachusetts for a job in California.  This includes their telephone number, email address and any social network contacts.  If the person you are tracking has an ongoing career in a specific field, the person may be on a business or professional networking web site that may list their current contact information.  Ask them about the person’s interests or hobbies. These interests may place the person on a special interest website or blog.   Try to identify as many former friends and family members of the person as you can. The person may be traceable through them.  These search engines can be used to look for names and addresses.   Search engines also can link the person to social networks, blogs, professional networks and special interest networks. To search for someone on Google, type in the person’s name, and the state they currently live in, if you have this information, for example: “Jane Doe Idaho”. If they have a very common name, it helps to narrow down the search by searching their full name, their current resident state, and any other personal information you may have.You can also type the person’s phone number, if you have this information, into google to get their full name and address.  Links to those people may enable you to track the person through family, friends or business associates.  

make a list of information you have about the person you are tracking.  find the last known contact information that you have for the person.  note the person's last known employer.  get in touch with friends or mutual acquaintances of the person you are looking for.  search the person on internet search engines.  search online for family members, friends and known business associates of the person. 

 Kidney stones can become more severe and painful if left untreated. If you think that you may have kidney stones, then you should see a doctor as soon as possible. Your doctor can diagnose your kidney stones based on your symptoms, a blood or urine test, or by using imaging such as a CT scan.Getting a CT scan is the most accurate way to determine if you have kidney stones. Your doctor can also use the results of the kidney stones to determine where the stones are at and how big they are., If you are diagnosed with kidney stones, then your doctor will recommend the best course of treatment for your situation. This may include drinking plenty of water in order to help pass the kidney stones or administering special medications to help you pass the stones.   If you kidney stones are large, then your doctor may need to use something called “extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy” or ESWL. This procedure breaks large stones into smaller ones so that you can pass them more easily.Your doctor can also use a scope to break up a stone that is trapped in your ureter and make it easier for your body to pass.Be aware that surgery may be required for severe cases of kidney stones that do not respond to other forms of treatment., If your pain is severe, then your doctor may prescribe a prescription pain-killer. But in less severe cases of kidney stones, an over-the-counter pain killer will help to numb the pain.You may take ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or aspirin depending on your medical needs and personal preferences. Ask your doctor for a recommendation if you are not sure what to take. Read and follow the product instructions for any medicine that you take.

 A clean catch is also known as a mid-stream urine sample. This works best for older, toilet-trained boys who can pass urine when asked to do so. However, such boys may still need help. A clean catch involves placing a cup under the urine stream to collect the urine., Lay out a couple paper towels to provide a clean area to set the specimen cup, three sterile wipes, and the urine specimen cup. You should be able to reach the supplies easily., Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, and have your son wash his hands with soap and water. It is important that you keep everything clean in order to avoid contaminating the urine sample.Avoid touching anything unnecessary, such as the wall, your face, etc. until after you collect the urine. Put on rubber gloves if they are available.  It is best to pull underwear and pants down to at least his mid-thighs to avoid getting urine on them.  Place the lid with the flat side (outside) facing down on the paper towel. Do not touch the inside of the lid or inside of the specimen container. It is best to keep your fingers away from the rim when handling the container., You must clean your son's penis in order to prevent contamination of the urine sample.   If your son is uncircumcised, gently retract the foreskin. Ask a nurse or doctor how to do so if you are unsure. Wipe the entire surface with the sterile/alcohol towelettes provided by the doctor's office.Using the sterile wipe, stroke around the urethral opening (end of the penis) toward his stomach. Discard the wipes.Replace the foreskin once the area dries.Gently pat the tip of the penis dry with a sterile cotton swab or gauze pad.,, With the specimen cup ready, have him start urinating into the toilet. If he has difficulty, try turning on the water faucet., After your son has urinated a small amount into the toilet, position the cup under the stream.He should continue to urinate. Hold the cup close enough so that the urine doesn’t splash, but not so close that his penis touches the cup.Moving the cup into his stream while he is peeing is a bit messy, and your fingers may get wet.  Take the cup away when it's about 1/3 full. Do not allow the cup to overflow.   Your son should finish urinating into the toilet/urinal after you have removed the cup.If the cup is even a 1/4 full and force of his stream lets up, remove the cup before he stops peeing., Place the cover tightly on the specimen cup without touching the cup rim or inside of the lid. Once it is closed, you may wipe off any urine from the outside of the cup.   Set the cup in a safe place to give to the doctor/nurse, or place it inside the special door for urine samples if there is one in the bathroom.If you are taking the sample at home, refrigerate the sample until you take it to the doctor's office., If he is uncircumcised, gently pull the foreskin forward after he has finished urinating. Help him to pull up his underwear and pants, and have him wash his hands. Wash your hands, also. 

do a clean catch.  prepare the test supplies.  wash up.  help your son to pull down his pants and underwear.  open the specimen container.  clean your son's urinary area.  have your son stand facing the toilet or urinal.he may assist by aiming at the toilet/urinal or, if he is uncircumcised, by gently holding back his foreskin (it should remain retracted until the sample has been collected).  ,  ask him to pee.  collect the urine.  remove the cup.  close the specimen cup.  help your son dress and wash his hands.

 If you accidentally forget to make a couple of payments, you are not necessarily going to be in trouble. Ideally, you should never miss a payment. However, if you do, then call up your ex-spouse and tell him or her.   You can say, “Maureen, it’s Gary. You’re probably wondering where the alimony payment was this month. I’m sorry, but I forgot. I’ll send it to you right now.”; , You aren’t excused from making a payment simply because you forgot. Instead, you need to catch up on your late payments as soon as possible. Depending on your state, you may also have to pay an interest charge on each late payment.If you are having trouble paying alimony because you lost a job or are suffering other financial stress, then you need to ask the judge for a modification. You can’t simply stop making alimony payments.  You might not be good at remembering to make alimony payments. In this situation, you might benefit from having your wages garnished. With wage garnishment, a portion of your paycheck is withheld and then sent to your ex-spouse.   Wage garnishment is also called a “wage withholding order.”You or your ex-spouse can go to the court and ask how to set up wage garnishment. The court should have forms you can complete.  There is a difference between missing a few payments because you are forgetful and not paying because you know you don’t have the money. If you don’t have the money, then you need to work out a plan to change your alimony payments.   Your ex might agree to modification. You should call her or him and discuss what has happened so that you can no longer pay alimony. If your ex-spouse won’t agree, you can probably go into court and ask for a modification. However, coming to an agreement is usually easier. Check to see whether you can modify your alimony. Some alimony decrees are “non-modifiable.” This means they can’t be changed.You should read your divorce settlement agreement or divorce decree to see if you can modify the alimony.  Judges use civil contempt to enforce their orders.You may be held in contempt if you repeatedly refuse to make alimony payments. Your ex-spouse will file a contempt motion with the court and send you a copy. You will then have an opportunity to attend a hearing and explain to the judge why you haven’t been making payments.   If you have a valid reason for not making payments—such as you have lost your job—then the judge might have sympathy. However, you shouldn’t wait until a contempt proceeding to bring these issues to the judge’s attention. Instead, file a motion for modification.  One way a judge tries to get you to comply with their order is to fine you.The judge might fine you a certain amount for each day that you refuse to pay the alimony. These fines can add up, and they accrue on top of the unpaid alimony.   The purpose of the fines is to compel your compliance with the judge’s orders. Once you agree to make alimony payments—and actually do make payments—the judge will stop fining you.  A judge can also suspend your driver’s license as part of a civil contempt ruling.Losing your license will make it harder for you to work and harder to catch up on late alimony payments.   Nevertheless, the judge might threaten you with losing your license to induce you to promise to pay your alimony.  As part of contempt, judges can also issue a “writ of execution” on your bank and other financial accounts. This writ allows the court to seize your assets and turn them over to your ex-spouse.The judge can seize savings accounts, checking accounts, and other financial accounts (such as CDs). You should not try to hide assets. The judge will be able to subpoena financial records from your bank to try and trace where the money has gone.  The judge may also be able to put a lien on your property and foreclose on it. This means the judge forces a sale and takes the money you owe from the proceeds., A judge might also require that you pay your ex’s attorney’s fees for bringing the contempt proceeding.You will have to pay for his or her lawyer, as well as for court costs (like filing fees).  In Illinois, for example, a judge can actually extend the amount of time you need to pay alimony if the judge finds you in contempt of court.For example, the initial alimony award might have been for five years. However, your deliberate refusal to pay could mean that you pay alimony even longer.  A judge can also order that go to jail for refusing to pay alimony.However, jail is usually the last resort, and the judge will try to get your compliance by applying other penalties.In Virginia, for example, you can be imprisoned for up to a year. You may also be required to work while you are in prison., Alimony enforcement varies according to each state.Not all of the techniques mentioned in this section are available in every state. Only a qualified divorce lawyer can advise you about the consequences of deliberately refusing to pay.   If you had a lawyer help you with the divorce, then contact him or her. Ask what is likely to happen if you stop making alimony payments. You might not have used a lawyer for your divorce. If not, then contact your local or state bar association and ask for a referral., If you lost your job or suffered another financial setback, then you should get documentation. You want to show your ex-spouse and the judge that you can no longer pay your required alimony.   For example, get copies of your termination notice and proof that you are now on unemployment benefits. If you are self-employed, gather proof that you can’t work as much as you used to. For example, clients may no longer be hiring freelance help. Save emails where you contact former clients looking for work. You can’t simply refuse to work because you don’t want to pay alimony. If you are able to work (but choose not to), then the judge will “impute” a certain amount of income to you.This means that the judge will assume you can make a certain amount of money—and will treat you as if you already are making that amount of money.  In most states, you can only modify alimony if there has been a substantial change in circumstances.You should point out as many circumstances as you can that warrant reducing your alimony. Common changes include:   Illness. If you suffered a medical crisis, then you might have high medical bills and/or not be able to work as much as you used to. Financial loss. In addition to losing a job, you might also have seen a drop of income because of failed investments, a declining stock market, etc. Changes in your ex-spouse’s lifestyle. You can typically modify alimony if your ex-spouse has moved in or married someone else, or if they have had a change in their financial situation (e.g., got a job).  If you and your ex-spouse can agree to modify alimony, then you should draft a joint petition and submit it to the court for approval.Check with the court clerk to see what forms you need.File your forms with the court that issued the original alimony order. Typically, you can get the judge to sign off on your proposed joint petition without appearing in court. However, if the judge has questions, then she or he will schedule a hearing.  If you can’t pay alimony, you should file for a modification instead of waiting around for a contempt proceeding. Being proactive shows the court that you are serious and trying to meet your obligations.When your spouse won’t agree to a modification, you have to ask the court to give you one. Go to the court where you received your divorce decree. Tell the clerk you want to modify alimony.   You probably have to fill out several forms. For example, you may need to complete a “petition” or “complaint.” There may also be financial forms to complete, such as a “financial affidavit” or “financial statement.” Ask the clerk for all of the forms that you need.  Enter the information in the form neatly. Use a typewriter or print legibly using black ink. If you need to use extra space, then attach a blank sheet of paper and clearly indicate what part of the form your answer refers to.   Double check your information so that you know it is accurate. You will have to sign most forms under penalty of perjury, so you should double-check all information. You might also need to sign the forms in front of a notary public.You can find notaries in the courthouse. Show acceptable personal identification to the notary, such as a valid state-issued ID or a passport. You have to file your forms with the court. Make a copy of all forms and take them (along with the original) to the court clerk.Ask the clerk to file. The clerk can stamp your copies with the filing date. You will probably have to pay a filing fee. If you can’t afford the fee, then ask the clerk for a fee waiver form.  You will probably have to attend a hearing before the judge will modify your alimony. Each court handles the scheduling of hearings differently. You should check with the court clerk.   In some courts, you need to give the clerk a hearing date. You then have to notify your ex of the hearing date by completing a Notice of Hearing form, which you can get from the clerk. In other courts, the clerk will schedule the hearing and notify everyone.  You have to give your ex notice that you are filing for a modification. Generally, you can hire someone to hand deliver the paperwork to your ex. Check with the court for acceptable methods of service.   In some courts, you can pay the sheriff or constable to make hand delivery.You may also be able to hire a private process server. You can find process servers in the phone book or online. After making service, the server will fill out an affidavit or proof of service form. He or she will return the completed form to you. You must file it with the court clerk.  At the hearing, you should explain to the judge why you need to modify alimony. Be prepared to share any documentary evidence that backs up your claim. You should also have witnesses be prepared to testify on your behalf.   For example, you could have a former boss testify that he laid you off and can’t rehire you because the economy is too slow. Your ex also gets to argue why the alimony shouldn’t be modified. You should listen quietly to his or her argument. If your ex has witnesses testify, then you may be able to ask them questions.At the end of the hearing, the judge will make a decision and sign an order. In some courts, the clerk will fill out the order. However, in other courts, the winning party must complete it.  

notify your ex-spouse.  catch up on your late payments.  have your wages garnished, if necessary.  discuss modifying alimony with your ex.  understand contempt.  pay fines.  lose your driver’s license.  give up financial assets.  lose your property.  reimburse your ex-spouse’s attorney’s fees.  pay alimony longer.  spend some time in jail.  meet with a lawyer.  document that you can’t pay.  find other significant changes.  draft an agreement with your ex.  get the appropriate court forms.  complete the forms.  schedule a hearing.  serve a copy of your papers on your ex-spouse.  attend a hearing. 

 Stop for a moment and think about your current obligations and prioritize them. Take a piece of paper and write them all down in order of importance, then decide which ones you would give up to play.; , From the list of things you would give up, decide if there are any that you SHOULD give up. Next to each item, try to think of the consequences of giving it up. If you cannot think of any, try asking friends or relatives for insight. There are consequences to every action whether you can see them or not, so it is important to be able to see if they are damaging or not so damaging. Make an effort to only give up obligations that have insignificant consequences.  World of Warcraft displays the current time beneath the mini-map. Additionally, there is an alarm feature that you can set that makes a bright orange message pop up at the designated time. Before you begin to play, determine what time you need to stop and either pay attention to the clock, or set yourself a reminder.  When you determine the time you will stop playing, commit to it and do not adjust it on the fly. If you have told yourself you will log out at 9:00, do it. Even if there is a change in circumstance, for example a cancelled appointment, log out at your designated time. Step away from it for a few minutes and determine if you might need the time for something else. Give it a few minutes of thought and if you still feel you have the time to play, log in again and set a new stop time.  Feel confident in the knowledge that you will be able to enjoy a community of millions of gamers immersed in a fantasy realm without becoming one of the few, desperate people living only for the game. Be satisfied that you are able to balance a fulfilled life in the real world without sacrificing the marvels of Azeroth (or any other fantasy world.)  

prioritize.  determine the consequences.  manage your time.  commit to your log out time, and stay disciplined.  enjoy yourself. 

 Acetone is a chemical that reacts with the gel nail to loosen its adhesive and free it from your natural nail. Acetone is a common ingredient in nail polish remover, but in order to remove gels, you need a concentrated amount of pure acetone.          Cover the bowl of acetone with plastic wrap or foil. Use a rubber band to hold the cover in place. Place the acetone in a larger bowl of warm water, so the acetone warms up. Let it sit for 3 to 5 minutes. Then remove the acetone from the outer bowl to prevent overheating. Be careful with this process, because acetone is flammable. Keep the acetone away from any direct heat sources, and warm only gently and with care.; , Acetone can dry out and damage your skin, so its important to protect it with a layer of jelly. If you don't have plain petroleum jelly, use a lotion or balm that lists it as an ingredient.          Dip a cotton swab in the petroleum jelly and use it to apply the petroleum jelly around the edges of your nails. Cover the skin on your fingers down just below your top knuckles. Don't get too much jelly on your nails, since the acetone needs to be able to dissolve the gel.  Dip a cotton ball in acetone to completely saturate it, then hold it against your nail and wrap it in a strip of aluminum foil to fix it in place. Repeat with your remaining nails. Let your nails soak in acetone for 30 minutes.          If acetone doesn't irritate your skin, you can dip your nails straight into the bowl instead of using cotton balls and aluminum foil. Make sure not to soak them like this for more than 30 minutes.  Remove the foil and cotton ball from one nail first. The gel should come right off when you swipe it with the cotton ball. If it does, repeat the process with your remaining nails.          You may have to help the gel come off by peeling it back a bit. If the gel on your test nail is still firmly in place, replace the acetone-soaked cotton ball, wrap it up in foil, and let your nails sit for another 10 minutes before trying again, continuing until the adhesive is softened and the nails can be removed. If this method doesn't work within one hour, the adhesive is probably resistant to acetone and another method should be employed.  Rinse off the acetone and then shape your natural nails with a nail file. Buff them with a nail buffer to remove rough edges. Moisturize your nails and hands with lotion or cosmetic oil.          File only in one direction, so you don't damage your nails. Avoid using a sawing motion. The acetone may have dried out your nails. Treat them gently for the next few days. You might want to wait a week or so before applying another set of gels.  

fill a bowl with acetone.  protect the skin around your nails with petroleum jelly.  wrap your nails in acetone.  remove the foil and cotton balls.  condition your nails. 

 Wash 2 cups (340 g) of fresh strawberries and use a knife to carefully cut and discard the stems. Cut the strawberries into quarters and place them in a blender or food processor. Add 3 tablespoons of sugar and put the lid on the blender. Puree the strawberries until they're completely smooth.Blending the strawberries will also help the sugar dissolve.  Get out a small bowl and measure 2 tablespoons of agar flakes into it. Carefully pour 1/8 cup (30 ml) of hot water over the flakes. Stir the mixture to dissolve the flakes and set the bowl aside, so the agar cools. Avoid letting the mixture turn solid.Agar flakes are a vegetable gelatin made from sea vegetables. This makes them a safe vegan choice for making mousse.  Pour 1 1/4 cups (300 ml) of whipping cream into a large mixing bowl along with 2 tablespoons of powdered sugar. Add the cooled agar mixture to the bowl. Use a stand or hand mixer with whisk attachments to whisk the ingredients on high speed. Whisk the mixture for a few minutes, so the cream becomes stiff.If you can, chill the mixing bowl and whisk attachments for 5 to 15 minutes before you whisk the mixture. A cold bowl will help the cream whip up faster.  Transfer the strawberry puree to a serving bowl or mixing bowl and add the whipped cream mixture. Use a rubber spatula to gently fold the cream into the strawberry puree. You can chill the mousse or scoop it into individual serving dishes before you chill it. Refrigerate the mousse for 4 to 6 hours, so it sets up.Garnish the mousse with 2 to 3 fresh strawberries and fresh mint.  

puree the strawberries with the sugar.  dissolve the agar flakes in hot water.  whisk the whipping cream, powdered sugar, and agar mixture.  combine the gelatin-free strawberry mousse. 

 It is easy to go off on tangents if you do not clearly state the reason you are writing the letter. Be sure to note this reason in the very first line of your letter.; , Many times, a letter to the editor is written in response to other letters or news stories that have been published in the paper. If this is the case, make reference to the item to which you are responding. If your item is not a response to another piece the paper published, find a current national, international or local news story from another media outlet to which you can refer. This will help your letter to not appear outdated or baseless.  It is important to know how many readers your letter will reach, as well as what types of people will read it. Find out if the paper to which you are writing has a political affiliation, and if your letter is at odds with that affiliation, be prepared for backlash.  If you see a certain style of letter is printed often, emulate those. , 

decide on one or two main points.  do whatever you can to make your letter timely.  know pertinent information about the publication to which you are submitting your letter.  read letters that have been published recently in the newspaper to which you are submitting your letter.  be sure your letter includes several different methods by which personnel from the newspaper can contact you, such as your mailing address, home and cell phone numbers and an e-mail address.  ,  print your name under your signature.  

 For some people with paraphrenia, their delusions may be worsened by environmental factors. They may think they are hearing voices because the neighbor’s voice is floating through the walls, or they may hear their neighbors talking and believe they are talking about them. Once you are aware of the specifics of your loved one’s delusions, you can help make any modifications to their living environment that may trigger or exacerbate their delusions.For example, if your loved one believes people are living in the walls, you can remove mirrors from around the house so they cannot see their reflection. If they hear voices, then playing music may help block their auditory delusions.  People with paraphrenia may try drastic measures to get rid of the delusions. They may want to move to another home if the delusions are related to the neighbors. They may even avoid using their heater in the winter despite the cold. Help your loved one see that these drastic measures are unnecessary because they are only reacting to their delusions.You may need to stay with the person to help them through the psychotic episode, or your loved one may need to be admitted to the hospital. People can suffer from command hallucinations — auditory hallucinations in which a voice tells or commands them to do something or act a certain way — that can be harmful or cloud the person's judgement. Discuss how to handle these hallucinations with the person's healthcare provider.  One way to help your loved one if they are suffering from hallucinations is to distract them. This may help to get their mind focused on something other than their delusions. These distractions can be activities with family, other seniors, or hobbies. Try to find things your loved one is interested in so they will be more likely to participate.   You may try helping your loved one find a hobby, such as knitting, reading, or crafts. You may want to help create an activity schedule for your loved one so they have one activity planned each day. This helps keep them active, social, and distracted. Being alone and inactive too much can encourage delusions and worsen symptoms of depression or anxiety.  Since your loved one has paraphrenia, they will have odd and elaborate delusions. This may happen when you are with your loved one, or your loved one may tell you about a delusion when you see them the next time. Respond empathetically in a clam, kind, and controlled manner.   You should neither agree with the delusion nor directly challenge it. Instead, try to validate their feelings. For instance, if the person is hearing voices, don't say "Yes, I hear them, too," or "There's nothing there. You're hallucinating." Instead, try something like, "I don't hear those voices, but I can see that it's really upsetting you."Don’t get angry or annoyed at your loved one — remember that delusions are due to illness, not stubbornness or stupidity., Since your loved one has paraphrenia, they will more than likely have a psychotic episode while you are with them. Most psychotic episodes occur because a person stops taking their medication. When you notice the signs of a psychotic episode, you should call your loved one’s doctor immediately. The warning signs vary depending on the person’s paraphrenia, but common warning signs may include:Isolating themselves Increased insomnia An increase in paranoia, delusions, or hallucinations Disinterest in personal hygiene An increase in hostility toward you or others Unexplained disappearances Confusing or unintelligible speech Lack of judgement or impulsive behavior  , You should have a plan in place for psychotic episodes so you can help your loved one if one occurs. A psychotic episode is happening when your loved on has a sudden delusion or hallucination so severe that they detach from reality. The delusion may cause your loved one to be a threat to their personal or others’ well-being.Contact your loved one’s doctor or emergency services. Your loved one may need to be hospitalized. Make sure you know which hospital your loved one needs to go to. Eliminate any triggers, such as television, music, or anything with loud noises. Speak to your loved one in a calm voice to help diffuse the tension. Refrain from reasoning with them since they have broken with reality.  Being diagnosed late in life with paraphrenia is not easy for your loved one. Your loved one may feel depressed or confused. They may also want to give up and think they would be better off dead. If your loved one feels this way, make sure they know that you love them and that you are there for them. Help them realize they are not alone.Even when in the middle of a delusion, you should treat your loved one with compassion, understanding, and love. Help your loved one feel safe with you. Listen to what your loved one has to say and really hear what they’re saying. This will help your loved one feel like they can come to you when they need help. Remember, since paraphrenia is diagnosed later in life, your loved one may not know how to need someone to help take care of them or how to adapt to living with a mental illness.  Because paraphrenia occurs in older or elderly people, you may feel the urge to treat your loved one like a child or an invalid. You may want to do everything for them to make it easier on them or because you don’t think they can do it themselves. This is not healthy for your loved one. Despite the paraphrenia, they can still live a normal, healthy life. Help your loved one do things for themselves while you are together.   This causes less stress for you because you do not have to be responsible for every detail of your loved one’s life.  

remove any triggering items.  discourage drastic reactions to delusions.  create distractions.  react appropriately to delusions.  recognize the warning signs of a psychotic episode.  take action during psychotic episodes.  show understanding and love.  refrain from treating your loved one like a child.

 There are several different types of thrillers. Choosing a type can help you determine the plot of the novel. The most common types of thrillers are:Psychological thriller: This type of thriller focuses on the psychological motives of the characters in your novel. Psychological thrillers usually include a main character who is mentally disturbed. (Ex. Family problems, the death of relatives, etc. Mystery thriller: This type of thriller focuses on the solving of a mystery, but in a fast-paced, intense environment.(Theft, murder, suicide) Science Fiction thriller: This type of thriller uses a lot of the themes and ideas in the science fiction genre. (Ex. Mutation, zombies, monsters, etc.) Spy thriller: This type of thriller focuses on spies and espionage.(Ex: Assassination, elimination, kidnapping, etc. Military thriller: This type of thriller is based on wars, whether real or fictional.(Ex: Wars, nuclear projectiles, hacking, etc.; , A good thriller comes from a strong story idea. Most thrillers are built around a protagonist who falls victim to another character or has to fight against another character. Sit down and brainstorm story ideas for your novel that are specific to you and your perspective.For example, you may have a story idea about death and rebirth, where a character comes close to death and then reaffirms themselves. Or you may have a story with a hero who prevents a crime. Another option is a story idea where a character prevents a disaster and improves society by solving a problem or dilemma.  Good thrillers will also have interesting, engaging characters to carry the story forward. Your protagonist or main character should be complex and have a detailed backstory, which is the history of a character or their past. Avoid using stock characters in your novel, as this can take all the energy out of the story and make it feel predictable for the reader.Avoid stock characters often found in thriller novels, like the hard-boiled detective, the cold, button-downed FBI agent, or the eager young reporter. Make your characters more complex and specific. For example, you may have a detective that is blind and travels everywhere with a service dog, or an FBI agent who has a shady past and is eager to solve a difficult case. Think about different traits and qualities you can give your characters to make them unique and not a stereotype.  To get a better sense of the genre, read examples of thriller novels. Try to read a variety of different thrillers and different types of thrillers so you get a sense of what is being published. You may read:The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris  The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson  Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier  The Talented Mr. Ripley by Patricia Highsmith  The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson  , To make writing the novel much easier, plot out your novel. Use a plot diagram to plot out the novel, making sure you keep the stakes high and the conflict going in the plot. A plot diagram will have exposition, the inciting incident, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution.   You can also use the snowflake method to plot out the novel. The snowflake method consists of a one-sentence summary, a one paragraph summary, character synopses, and a spreadsheet of scenes.  Start the thriller novel with a scene right in the action. Starting with action will throw the reader into the scene right away and assure them they are in for some major thrills. Introduce the crime or describe the protagonist in a the middle of a dilemma or major issue.Avoid including backstory or exposition in the opening pages of the novel. You can do this later. Start with the most interesting or engaging moments first. For example, you may start a thriller with a description of a killer hunting down a victim. This will immerse the reader in the world of the story right away.  As the novel goes on, make sure the stakes are always high for the main character and for the reader. This means putting your main character in situations that are difficult or risky. Keep conflict going between characters. Create obstacles that get in the way of the character solving a crime or achieving what they want. Make the main character’s life full of complications or issues.For example, maybe you have a thriller where a young, eager FBI agent wants to solve a difficult case. You may make it difficult for the agent to achieve their goal by causing evidence to be lost in a fire or by having a witness go missing.  Do not include any unnecessary information or information that does not further the plot. Make sure the action moves forward continually in the novel and that the pace is always fast. Thriller are at their best when they are action packed and focus more on plot than anything else.For example, rather than include long sections of backstory for your main character, focus instead on getting the main character from scene to scene. Weave in backstory into a scene when necessary and keep the plot moving at all times.  Most good thrillers will have an exciting climax, often three-quarters of the way into the novel. The climax is the moment when the stakes are the highest and the story is at its highest point of suspense and tension. Your main character may confront the antagonist of the novel in the climax. They may solve the main problem or issue in the story. Or they may come to a realization that shifts or changes their world view.   For example, the climax of the novel may be the moment your main character unmasks the killer. Or it may be when the main character realizes the solution to a major issue or problem in the story.  Wrap up the novel on a high, suspenseful note. Rather than try to wrap up all the loose ends in the book, focus on ending on a scene that will keep the reader guessing. Show the main character making a decisive act in the last scene. Or have the main character come to a realization in the last scene that shows they have changed or shifted in the course of the novel.For example, you may have a long, elaborate foot chase at the end of the novel, with one last scene between the FBI agent and the killer.  Once you have completed the novel, read over the first draft. Read it out loud to yourself. Notice if the draft moves quickly and efficiently. Check if there are any plot holes. Look for any moments where you can sharpen or deepen your characters.  You can also get feedback from others on the draft to make it stronger. Show the draft to a writing group or to a writing mentor. Enroll in a thriller writing class and have the draft workshopped there.   You can also show the draft to friends and family for their perspective and advice. Be open to constructive criticism, as it will often make the novel stronger.  Once you have received feedback on the draft, revise it for action, suspense, and plot. Ask yourself, is this scene as suspenseful as it could be? Is there enough action in the novel as a whole? Does the plot make sense and keep readers on the edge of their seat? 

choose a thriller type.  brainstorm story ideas.  develop engaging characters.  read examples of thriller novels.  plot out the novel.  begin with a bang.  maintain high stakes.  keep the action moving.  build to an exciting climax.  end on a high note.  read over the first draft.  show the draft to others.  revise the draft for action, suspense, and plot. 

 Dissolve the spices' capsaicin with the casein protein found in milk.If you’re at home, fetch yourself a glass of milk pronto. If you're at a restaurant, flag the server down and order one right away. Or, if a yogurt dish has been served as a side to your meal, treat your mouth to a spoonful, since the dairy in that will work, too.Ice cream works even better, since the “ice” provides some blissful relief, while the “cream” provides something more or less solid to suck on for a while before it melts.; , Pour yourself an ounce of hard liquor. Knock your shot back without swallowing. Swish the liquid around in your mouth. Unless the liquor has been chilled beforehand, the heat-on-heat sensation may feel unpleasant at first, but rest assured that the alcohol is dissolving the capsaicin and ridding your nerves of the agitating agent.Use hard liquor rather than beer or wine. The alcohol itself is needed to actually get rid of the capsaicin, so pour yourself something with a high content. Most liquors average around 40% alcohol content, while beer is typically less than 10% with wine only reaching 20% at its highest.If you’re not a drinker, don’t worry. Go ahead and spit the liquor out once you’re done rinsing your mouth with it. There is no need to swallow.  If you’re at home, fetch the sugar bowl. If you’re at a restaurant, rip open a packet. Soak up the spice with the granules by either dumping the sugar right into your mouth,or by mixing a tablespoon with 8 ounces of water for sweet relief.Honey works just as well.  Suck on milk chocolate if you have it, since this will contain casein, the protein in milk that dissolves capsaicin. If all you have is dark chocolate with no dairy content, fall back on that. It will be less effective, but the fat content will absorb some of the spice., Grab a roll from the bread bowl or a couple slices from your bread box. It won’t break the capsaicin down, so don’t keep it in your mouth for too long. Chew it up as you’d normally eat a hunk of bread. Let it absorb the spice in your mouth, then swallow or spit it out.If you have olive oil on hand, dip the bread in that, since olive oil will dissolve the capsaicin. Peanut butter will as well, so you can also try making a sandwich. Other starchy foods, like french fries, may also do the trick. Just be sure they’re not spicy, too!  

coat your mouth with dairy products.  have a shot of alcohol.  try a spoonful of sugar.  eat chocolate.  use bread as a sponge.

 It is recommended by firefighters that you mount smoke detectors high on the wall, or on the ceiling away from windows and exterior doors. (This is not the case for carbon monoxide alarms, about which, see #2, below.) Smoke fills up a room from the ceiling down, so having the detectors high should alert you early on. It is also recommended that detectors be placed at least 10 centimeter (3.9 in) / 4" from the wall when installed on the ceiling, and 10 centimeter (3.9 in) / 4" from the ceiling for wall installation.; , When installing a carbon monoxide alarm, choose a location where the alarm will stay clean, and out of the way of children or pets.  It is important to install detectors near sleeping areas and on every level of your home. Also place a detector in hallways and a carbon monoxide detector near heating, such as gas furnaces. Avoid installing a smoke detector in the kitchen. Unless, of course, you want everyone to notice your lack of culinary skills! Also keep detectors one meter / 3.3 feet (1.0 m) from the doorways of steam emitting areas, such as the bathroom, laundry or kitchen.   Measure the distance between the mounting holes on the back of the mounting bracket.       Mark the same distance on your chosen location.       Drill small holes at the marks.       Attach the mounting bracket to the surface with the screws. See "Tips" for seeking professional assistance.       Mount the rest of the detector into the bracket.    Routinely test your detectors. Push the test button to elicit a loud noise. If there is no noise, or a faint noise, you should check or change the batteries. For smoke detectors, you can also test the detector using simulated smoke. See How to Test a Smoke Detector.  A good way to remember is: Every time you change the clocks, change the batteries. Always test the unit after a battery change, to confirm that the batteries are properly installed and working.  This needs to be replenished over time, so be sure to check this as well as the batteries.  It's simple but it's an important step to take to help protect your loved ones and your home. To provide additional certainty on top of the detector, take a moment to develop a safety escape plan. Make sure that all the members of the family know this plan, know how they can escape and where they can all reassemble again once outside the house. Include special needs such as infants and the elderly when developing your plan.  

choose your location.  the diffusion of carbon monoxide in air is relatively even, meaning that a source of carbon monoxide can distribute the gas evenly throughout the room and house.  place smoke detectors in the best places around the house.  install the hardware.  perform regular maintenance.  try to change the batteries at least twice a year.  note that carbon monoxide detectors have a chemical that helps in the detection process.  rest a little easier.

 This is probably the most vital part of the process. Believe it or not, no matter how bad you feel about yourself, you are not alone. So many girls, especially during, feel depressed or in competition with others. Take a look at yourself. What are your best personal features? Maybe you are the top in your class: Do people tease you about that? Just think that in ten years time, you will be in a successful, well-paid job! Maybe you're bigger than your friends: Don't feel you have to diet, just choose clothes that suit you, get enough exercise, and smile...anyway, most people first notice your smile before anything else.; , Don't allow other people to tell you what to feel. If you're happy, go ahead and smile. If you're angry, give 'em a scowl. And if you're sad, cry, weep, or just stay calm. Be yourself.  Do not chew gum in school/libraries/in interviews/at work. There is nothing worse than gum falling out of your mouth at an important moment.  You don't need to fork out on expensive gym memberships. You can run around the block, cycle to the local shop on errands, or get off the bus a stop early. Every little thing helps. Also, the fresh air works wonders on conditions such as acne! Bonus!  , Stand up. Place your left foot in a direct vertical line downwards from your shoulder. Place your right foot's heel at the arch of your left foot, and turn out about 20*. See? Easy elegance. This not only makes you appear more poised and glamorous, but it also makes your legs seem slimmer! When walking, look straight ahead, with your shoulders down and comfortably back. Imagine a wire coming from your head to the sky which you must not bend or move. There! The perfect posture. When sitting, try not to slouch. If you can, sit all the way back on your chair, with your feet on the floor, and your back on the back of the seat. If you often come home feeling tight and sore around your neck and shoulders, take time to lie flat on the floor and stretch. Then lie upside-down on the sofa with your head pointing towards the ground. This will help elongate the spine and help to relieve the aches. Keep in mind, though, that sometimes it's okay to relax, lean, or slouch. Good posture is generally good for your long term health, but do it because you want to and it fits the mood, not because you think other people want you to look that way.  What do you love doing? If you're a beach bum at heart, try to swim as much as possible, and get to the beach whenever you can. Just add mates and plenty of sun cream and you have a great day. Or perhaps you're an avid shopaholic. To avoid wasting all your money, feel free to go shopping and impulse buy -- but keep the receipts, leave all tags on, hang them up in your room. A week later, if you wish you hadn't bought them, then you can simply return them!  , If you like to dress up, go for it. If you just want to be comfortable, that's okay to. The ideal girl is the one who chooses clothes that are appropriate to a situation and her mood, and not to what others tell her.  Choose people who understand you, who listen to you, and who you connect with. Friends (and more than friends) are what make you happy and successful, not jewelry or other accessories.  The truth is that most skin issues are either genetic, are temporary (almost everyone has problems with their skin as a teenager), or are caused by things like the food you eat, where you live, and what you do.  Look however you want, and be proud of it. An ideal girl spends more time on her mind, her friendships, and her spirit than on her looks.  Whether you're at college, middle school or sixth form, getting grades is massively important. Working hard earlier on makes life easier later on when it comes to finding a job, paying the bills, or attracting the man of your dreams. Organize your schoolwork and get useful apps. If your school mates are giving you a hard time for being clever, tell them to shut up Being a well paid business woman is much cooler than working in McDonald's for your whole life.  Do not starve yourself to lose weight. Being healthy doesn't mean eating less, it just means eating more of the right foods and less of the wrong foods. Make sure you get a lot of protein in your diet - meat tends to have lots of protein. Your body also needs the vitamins and fibers from other foods such as fruit. An example of a healthy diet change is eating whole grain or black bean pasta instead of normal pasta. More protein, less carbs! Also, make sure that you drink enough water a day. If you begin to feel hungry, have a glass of water before eating. Often, you will feel hungry if you're actually thirsty!  , Try learning a musical instrument, like the saxophone. Join a local music group; not only are these a great way to improve your skill, but it's a great way to make like minded friends and guys! Or maybe you could learn a language; you can travel all over the world and communicate with locals, making your stay so much more fun. You can also meet lots of people that you wouldn't ordinarily meet through a language! You may be really good at sports so join a dance class or soccer class. Why not give it a go? It's easier than you may think! Just think of all the hot Italians/Spaniards/French guys you could meet!  , Don't ever change yourself to meet the pressures of your peers. If someone gives you criticism, just think: 'Do I trust the person?' 'Do I value their advice?' 'Do they have a point?'. After saying yes to all these questions, consider taking action on the criticism. If the answers are no, just brush them off...they're probably jealous anyway! Finally, never change for a guy. If he doesn't appreciate you for how you really are, he will never love you as truly as you want. Keep your eyes open for that perfect guy, you never know, he could be hiding in the least likely place!  , Your idea of "ideal" might be very different from somebody else's. So, you should try to be what you think is ideal -- not what somebody else tells you is ideal.  

learn to love yourself.  smile, but only if you want to.  exercise.  correct your posture.  have fun.  look however you want.  choose the right friends.  stop worrying about your skin.  tell anyone who says that you need to "look fantastic" to go back the 1950s where they belong.  work hard.  eat well.  find yourself a talent.  be yourself.  remember that what constitutes "ideal" is a matter of opinion. 

 Check if your address is handwritten or poorly typed and if it contains any misspellings of common words, such as your street name or your city. You should also note if your name is misspelled or not specified on the package, as this may indicate the sender may be suspicious.You should also note if there is no return address on the package or a strange return address that you do not recognize. A suspicious package may also be marked with certain restrictions like “Personal”, “Confidential” or “Do not x-ray”. You should also note if there is any threatening language on the package, such as “Beware of contents”.; , Examine the outside of the package for any powdery substances on the envelope or wrapping. Lightly hold the package and feel through the wrapping or the envelope for any powdery substances. You may also notice oily stains or discoloration on the outside of the package.Note if the package has a strange or strong odor, as this may indicate there is a suspicious substance in the package. Try to smell the package quickly and only once, as you do not want to inhale or come in contact with any substances in the package.  Hold the package in your hands and check if it is very heavy or has excessive weight to it. You should also check for any ticking noises or sounds coming from the package and any protruding wires or aluminum foil coming out of the package.Be cautious if the package has excessive packaging material like layers of masking tape, string, and/or glue, as this may indicate the sender did not want to make it easy for you to determine what is in the package.  If you believe the package may be suspicious, it is important that you do not shake, open, or empty the contents of the package. You should also avoid carrying the package or showing it to others to examine.If you determine it is suspicious, do not sniff, touch, taste, or look at any of the contents.  Let anyone else known in the residence, home, or area, that you believe you have received a suspicious package. Place the package on a stable surface and leave the area. Make sure anyone else in the area also evacuates and do not allow anyone to enter the area with the suspicious package.If you have a ventilation system, like an air conditioner system or a heating system, turn it off so the contents of the package cannot circulate in the area.  Give your hands a good wash with soap and water to prevent spreading any potentially dangerous substances to your face or skin. Once law enforcement officials arrive, they will be able to give you additional instructions on dealing with exposure to potentially dangerous substances., If you are at work, contact your supervisor or a security officer. Let them know you believe you have received a suspicious package and that they need to call local law enforcement.If you are at home, use your cellphone or a neighbor’s phone to call your local law enforcement and report the suspicious package. Try to make a list of the people who were in the room or area where the suspicious package was recognized and anyone who many have handled the suspicious package. You should provide this list to local law enforcement when they arrive on the scene.  

note the labeling and postage on the package.  look for any powdery substances or oily stains on the outside of the package.  check for excessive weight, ticking sounds, or protruding wires.  do not shake or open the package.  alert others in the area and leave the package on a stable surface.  wash your hands.  call your local law enforcement agency. 

 Standing with legs about shoulder-width apart and lean against the fitness ball for support.   Slowly bend the knees and lower your tailbone until you are almost in a sitting position. Hold the pose for several seconds and slowly return to a standing position.  Stand with your feet planted out past each side of your body, leaning with your back against the fitness ball on the wall.   Lower your body slowly, supporting your weight in your quadriceps, and hold the pose for several seconds. Stand up slowly and repeat.  Stand with your legs close together and with your back against the fitness ball on the wall.   Bend knees and lower your body to nearly a 90-degree angle.

 Make sure they know that you care.; , It's difficult being a teen. Studying at school all day and the constant pressure of peers always competing to be the best is exhausting. Everyone needs 'me' time.  Contribute to household chores and offer to take care of siblings. Parents need a break as well.  Give them something to keep them happy. Let them know what school's like for you, name a few friends and if you're interested in someone, let them know. Parents are happy knowing that you're happy, so acknowledge them in a small way. By doing this, parents will know that when you don't want to talk, it's fine. The parent should understand that you just simply want to be left with some privacy. , It's not fair and they were once kids as well. Let them know you will help them where you can. For your parents to understand you, you have to talk. No one is born with a set of instructions, so open up.  Even if you don't think your parents care, someone somewhere does. You can sort the problem out, and who knows? You might start helping others as well. 

ask your parents how their day went every day when they come in the house after work.  make sure your parents know that if you are locked in your room, it usually means you're tired, had a rough day, or just chilling.  allow parents to see you're a mature teen.  talk to your parents if they're interested.  if there is a problem in your life, promise to talk to your parents in your own time, but do talk to them if you can.  ,  sometimes both parents work and in some cases parents have more than one job.  if you're being bullied, talk to someone.  remember that communication goes both ways.  

 Indulge in a bath at the end of a long day, even if you don't feel especially sore. By relaxing your muscles, you send signals to your body letting it know that the time has come to rest and relax. Triggering your body's relaxation mode before you go to sleep can make your sleep more restful, leaving you feeling thoroughly recharged in the morning.   Alternatively, try taking a hot and cold shower. Hot-cold hydrotherapy is said to strengthen your body's immunity and improve its circulation. The improved circulation can make you feel refreshed. Take a hot shower like you usually do, then switch the temperature to cold and stay there for up to 30 seconds. Switch the water back to warm for another 30 seconds, then back to cold again for 30 more seconds before turning the water off.; , When you wake up in the morning, use a body scrub on your feet and hands. Use an exfoliating scrub for your face as well. Scrubs can scrape away dead skin cells and improve circulation throughout your body. As a result, your body will end up feeling more energized than before.  Eat lots of green, healthy vegetables, fruit, lean protein, good fats and whole grains. Filling your body with processed food, sugar, and alcohol can make you feel physically worn down. You do not need to cut out everything you enjoy from your diet, but limit unhealthy foods and focus on eating more nutritional meals and snacks.Eat breakfast. Skipping breakfast will leave you feeling drained by mid-morning, and if you compound the problem by eating a small lunch at the office, you will struggle to make up for the nutrients you lost by the time you get home. Your breakfast should contain a balance of complex carbohydrates, protein, and a little fat.  Stretch for at least five minutes every hour throughout the day. Stretching makes you feel less stiff and worn down.Moreover, it improves your circulation immediately, giving you a quick jolt of energy as a result.   Your stretches can be simple. For instance, try standing up, taking a deep breath and raising your arms above your head. Hold this pose for a few seconds before relaxing your arms and gradually bending forward at the waist. Then, gently roll your head forward and from side to side to loosen any stiffness in your neck.  The exercise you choose does not need to be vigorous or lengthy, but getting your body on the move for 10 to 30 minutes each day can cause your brain to release "happy" chemicals like serotonin,adrenaline and endorphins. As a result, your body and mind will both feel recharged.   For an added bonus, try exercising outside. A short walk on a sunny day gives your body plenty of vitamin-D enriched sunlight, and spending time outdoors—especially in nature—often recharges the mind as well as the body., Candles that contain essential oils are a good choice, or you can add a few drops of essential oil to your bathwater. Certain scents are believed to trigger a relaxation response in the body, while others may make your body feel more energized.   Lavender can help relax you.To recharge and revive your body, try scents like rosemary,juniper berry,peppermint,and citrus., Most adults only get five to six hours of sleep each night, while seven to nine hours are recommended for adults.The best thing to do for your body is simply to increase the amount of sleep you get each night and "repay" your sleep debt.Go to bed an hour early, if possible, for at least a week and notice the difference it makes.   If you are unable to get that much additional sleep, try taking a 20-minute nap.This amount of time prevents you from falling into a deep sleep but still treats your body to a little boost in energy.  Take a break for 10 minutes every 90 minutes throughout the day. During this time, do something that relaxes you. Meditate, listen to music, play with a pet or practice a hobby.   Make sure that the task you do during your break can be completed within that time period. Otherwise, you may find yourself feeling tense and distracted when you go back to work.  

take a warm bath.a long soak in a warm, relaxing bath can soothe the muscles in your body.  use a simple scrub.  improve your eating habits.  stretch.  get active.do an activity that you enjoy, such as taking a walk, running or swimming.  experiment with aromatherapy.  sleep more.  relax at regular intervals. 

 One aspect of caulking that can be confusing to first timers is the fact that multiple types of caulk exist for (seemingly) the same job. However, different types of caulk have different strengths and weaknesses which can make some varieties more appropriate for certain jobs than others. For instance, latex caulk is a type of caulk which is great for indoor projects. It has a low odor, which is important when ventilation is limited. It also has great expansion properties, can be easily cleaned up with water, and even comes in a variety of colors. Finally, latex caulk can be painted when it's dry, allowing you to make it practically invisible.   However, latex caulk doesn't quite have the durability of other varieties, which can be a problem if it's exposed to widely-varying temperatures, severe weather, and heavy wear.; , As you may expect from its name, acrylic latex caulk is a type of caulk that's made from latex combined with acrylic resins. This variety has all the strengths of latex caulk listed above. However, because of its acrylic properties, this caulk is more flexible and durable than ordinary latex caulk, making it a great choice for indoor situations in which it will be exposed to a high degree of wear and tear.  The sturdiest variety of caulk, which uses a silicone base, can be a pain to apply, but is suitable for the harshest conditions. Silicone caulk's toughness makes it great for situations in which it is exposed to widely-ranging temperatures, harsh weather conditions, and heavy wear. For durable all-weather protection, silicone chalk has no substitute.   However, silicone caulk has several disadvantages. It can't be painted, which means you may be stuck with its default clear appearance. It also is difficult to clean up with water, making spills and drips during the application process into serious headaches. Finally, it has a strong odor before drying, which makes good ventilation a must when applying the caulk.  Though it may seem like combining different varieties of caulk, like acrylic latex and silicone, for instance, might give you the strengths of each, in fact, doing so will simply give you a caulk that won't do its job. Each variety of caulk is specially formulated to work on its own. Mixing one type of caulk with another can leave you with a substance that may not bind to your surfaces, set, or provide proper protection. For baseboard caulking, where protection against water damage is a serious concern, you'll always want to use only one type of caulk at a time.  If you're tackling a relatively small, simple project, like, for instance, caulking your baseboards at the point that they meet a bathtub, you can usually get away with buying and using small "tubes" of caulk which allow you to squeeze caulk out like toothpaste for easy application. For larger projects, you'll want to use a caulking gun and compatible caulking cartridges, which are much quicker. Though it can take some time to get used to them, they're ultimately the more efficient option for large jobs.   Most caulking guns are quite cheap, costing around $10-$20 or less.  Caulk is tremendously sticky stuff — it's liable to bind to any "loose" object it touches. Because of this, it's very important to ensure that both your wall and your baseboard are clean before caulking. Dirt, dust, grease, and grime can mix with or stick to your caulk and make it look unappealing. More importantly, however, they can interfere with the ability of the caulk to bind to the surfaces you do want it to stick to. Since one of the uses of baseboard caulking is to prevent water damage, a tight seal is a must.   Use water or a household cleaner like Formula 409 to give your floor, baseboard, and wall a thorough cleaning. Try not to use soap with water, as this combination can leave a slick film on your surfaces, making it difficult for your caulk to stick. For floors that have accumulated lots of dust, vacuuming is one additional quick, efficient cleaning option. If you have the option, try using your vacuum's long, skinny "hard-to-reach-places" attachment to remove dust from corners.  While caulking is by no means a dangerous process, it is one that can be frustrating if you are forced to re-do work you've already done. To minimize the risk of avoidable mistakes, ensure that your work area is completely clear of furniture, rugs, and other potential obstructions before beginning. If you have children or pets, you'll also want to make sure they're kept out of your work area by setting up barriers or getting another person to monitor them. Nothing's worse than stopping your project to clean caulk out of a screaming toddler's hair.  When you caulk your baseboards, mistakes are inevitable. If it's your very first time, they'll be common. Luckily, when it comes to caulking, it's hard to make serious mistakes. For the vast majority of the errors you'll make, the old-fashioned combination of water and rags will suffice, though many household cleaners will also work well.   Additionally, since you'll be on your hands and knees for most of the caulking process, rags can be used as knee pads to provide comfort. Note that, as will be explained below, water alone is ineffective for cleaning up silicone-based caulks.  Perhaps the single most important thing you can do to ensure an easy, efficient caulking process is to lay down tape with great care. Taping beforehand allows you to protect against spills and ensures that your caulking job is smooth, clean, and uniform. No special tapes are required. Simply use ordinary masking tape (also called painter's tape), a thin, papery variety of tape which is usually tan or blue.   You'll want to lay two strips of tape along each area to be caulked. One should be on the floor, following along the length of the baseboard and almost touching it. The other should be on the wall roughly 1/16th of an inch above it, running parallel to it. A single, long length of tape is usually the easiest option in the long run, but using multiple manageable lengths is perfectly fine so long as they are all parallel to the the baseboard and aligned with each other.  Caulking guns use specially-designed cartridges to dispense caulk. These look like long cylindrical tubes with a skinny pointed cone or "nose" at one end. Before loading your cartridge, take a knife or a sharp pair of scissors and trim off the very end of this "nose" at about a 45 degree angle to create a small, slanted hole. This hole should be only about 1/8th of an inch in diameter — about the width of a matchstick.   Try to cut your cartridge's tip as conservatively as possible. It's easy to make a small hole bigger, but impossible to make a large hole smaller.  Next, use the gun's piercing rod (which is usually a stiff piece of wire attached to the gun) to poke a few holes in the cartridge's membrane through the hole you just cut in the tip. This allows caulk to flow easily out of the cartridge. The more holes you poke, the more easily the caulk will flow. About 4-5 holes is usually sufficient.   Note that some plastic cartridges don't have an internal membrane. If you don't feel any resistance when using the piercing rod, you'll know this is the case.  Most caulking guns can be loaded via the following steps:   Push the spring-loaded lever on the gun and hold it down. Pull the rod at rear of the gun (the "pushrod") all the way back while holding the lever down. Insert the cartridge into its slot butt-first, then drop the cartridge's point down into the space in the front of the gun. Make sure the angle of the cut in the point is facing downwards. You may need to turn the cartridge to do this. Finally, twist the pushrod so the notches are facing downward. Pull the trigger a few times until you feel resistance. You're now ready to caulk!  , To practice, spread out a large piece of newspaper on the floor and hold the point of your caulking gun against it. Pull lightly on the trigger until caulk begins to flow out of the nozzle. When caulk begins to flow out of the gun, move it slowly back while keeping constant pressure on the trigger. Try to make a long, thin, consistent line of caulk without any gaps or thick spots. When you're done, lift the nozzle from the work surface, then twist the pushrod so the notches are in the "up" position and depress the spring-loaded lever. This releases the pressure on the cartridge and stops the flow of caulk.   Don't squeeze too hard when you're applying caulk — this can rupture the cartridge, causing a mess and forcing you to start over.  When you're ready to caulk for real, hold the tip of your caulking gun against the space where the wall and the top of the baseboard meet. Keep the hole in the tip flat against the wall (this means you should hold the gun diagonally. Turn the notches in the pushrod downward. Squeeze on the trigger with steady pressure and begin moving the caulk gun along the length of the baseboard as the caulk flows out. Move at a slow, even pace. Continue along the entire length of the baseboard. Treat any spills with a damp rag.   Don't forget to repeat the process outlined in the practice step for stopping the flow of caulk when you're done with your run.  When you've caulked one edge of your baseboard, you'll want to smooth the caulk with your finger to ensure the caulk sits in its gap as securely as possible and also to ensure that the caulk has a uniform, smooth appearance. Drag the tip of one finger along the caulk lightly a few feet at a time. As soon as a significant amount of caulk accumulates on your finger, wipe it off with a clean, damp rag. Treat any spills with a separate damp rag.   Don't smooth with too much force. Apply only gentle pressure with your finger. Pressing too hard can scrape the caulk from the wall entirely.  Next, repeat the caulking process for the bottom length of the baseboard. Keep firm but steady pressure on the trigger of the caulking gun to dispense caulk along the bottom edge of the baseboard. Caulking the bottoms of the baseboards after you've finished smoothing the caulk on the top of the baseboard ensures that leftover caulk from the top won't spill onto your work below.   When finished, smooth over the caulk with your finger as described above.  When you've caulked and smoothed both edges of a length of baseboard to your satisfaction, it's time to pull your tape up. Be sure to do this while the caulk is still fresh. If the caulk dries before you pull up the tape, you'll end up pulling the caulk from the baseboard along with the tape and will have to repeat your work. Grab one end of your length of tape and pull it gently away from the surface at a forty five degree angle. Proceed slowly and delicately along the entire length of tape. Repeat for the second length of tape.   If you used multiple lengths of tape for a single surface, pull the tape from the wall in the same direction that you laid it. For instance, if you laid three overlapping pieces of tape from left to right, pull the tape from left to right as well. Handle the tape with care — the leftover caulk can stick to (and stain) clothing with ease.  For the most part, caulking isn't a terribly dangerous activity. You're unlikely to endanger yourself or others while caulking. This being said, there are things you can do to improve your (already very good) chances of finishing your caulking job unscathed. The first is to ensure that your work area is properly ventilated. Setting up a fan and/or opening windows improves the flow of air through your work area, which can disperse the odor and fumes that wet caulk can give off. This is especially important for silicone-based caulk, which has the strongest odor.   If you're working outside, you don't usually need to worry about this.  Caulk isn't dangerous or caustic like certain substances used for other home improvement projects — its very purpose is essentially to be as inert as possible. However, it is very sticky and hard to remove from skin and clothing (especially once it dries), so you may want to wear gloves when you work with caulk to keep it off of your fingers and sleeves. This also gives the benefit of making clean-up very quick and easy.   You may also want to wear goggles or protective eyewear, as caulk can be painful if splashed into the eyes (though this is unlikely).  The one time that you're most likely to hurt yourself while caulking is, ironically, before you're using caulk. As you cut the tip off of your caulk cartridge, take caution to ensure you don't cut yourself. If you're using a knife, be sure to hold the cartridge with your other hand away from the tip. Always cut away from your body — never towards it. When you're not using your knife or scissors, store it safely away from your work area.  Finally, it bears mentioning that, although caulk is fairly harmless, it is not meant to be consumed or inhaled and can cause serious health problems if it is. If you or someone you know accidentally consumes caulk, call a poison control center immediately for guidance.   Be sure to wash your hands after caulking to ensure you don't accidentally consume caulk while eating, drinking, coughing, and so on.  When you've caulked your baseboard and pulled your tape, all that's left to do is to allow it dry. Different types of caulk will have different drying times, so check your caulk's packaging for more information. Regardless of the amount of time it takes your caulk to dry, you'll want to ensure that no dirt or dust disturb it as it sets. You'll also want to ensure that young children and pets are kept away from the caulk as well.  When it comes to caulking, minor errors are all too common. Usually, fixing these errors by hand before the caulk sets by using your fingers is simpler and easier than fixing the errors after the caulk dries. To do this, just repeat the smoothing process with your finger, using extra caulk as needed. If you notice an error after your caulk has dried, re-apply tape to the offending area, apply caulk to your finger, and work it into the crack or gap until it's well-blended with the surrounding dry caulk. When your caulk dries, the repair should be barely-visible.   If you used a caulking gun for your main job but have a small caulk tube handy, you may find that it's much easier to use the tube for touch-up work than to have to assemble a caulk gun again, dispense caulk, and potentially clean up spills. Just be sure to use the same type of caulk as you used for the main job! As always, remember to remove the tape while the caulk is still fresh.  Congratulations! You're done. All that's left to do is to return your work area to the way it was before you began. Release the pressure on your caulking gun and remove the cartridge. Most cartridges come with a cap to preserve the leftover caulk. If yours does not, try using plastic wrap and a rubber band or tape. Wash your hands and your equipment with soap, water, and a washcloth. Remove any garbage or debris and replace any furniture, rugs, etc. you moved.   When using leftover caulk at a later date, note that you may need to use a nail or tack to remove dried caulk from the nozzle of the cartridge.  In general, caulking is a fairly cheap and easy home improvement project. However, it has its limitations. Caulk is useful for sealing small, thin gaps between baseboards and the floor or wall. It's not, however, appropriate for protecting the baseboard itself, which must be painted to provide protection from water damage and wear and tear. Additionally, while baseboard caulking is great for making the bottom edges of a room water-tight, it provides little protection against large sources of water damage, like burst pipes, leaky ceilings or walls, and so on. Thus, baseboard caulking is best used as just one part of a more extensive plan for water-proofing a room which should also include painting, finishing, tiling, and more.   It's also worth noting that baseboards should not be caulked when the floor or wall is unfinished wood. In this situation, caulk provides little protection from water and cannot form a tight seal against the surface it is applied to.  The time that it will take to caulk varies based on the size of your project as well as how long it takes you to become familiar with your tools. Most one-room jobs can be completed within an hour or two, while longer jobs can take days. Regardless of the size of your job, you won't want to rush, so leave yourself more time than you think you'll need. A thorough caulking job can take lots of time in the short term, but mistakes in your caulking that can result from rushing can cost you more time in the long run.  Generally, caulking is quite cheap. Caulking guns retail from about $5-$10 for cheap options up to about $20 for the highest-quality options. Cartridges of caulk usually cost no more than $5. In addition to these things, you may need to buy masking tape, a knife or scissors, and gloves. All in all, you usually won't need to spend more than $30-$40. If you own some of these materials already, your costs will be lower.   Your costs will vary based on how many cartridges of caulk you need to buy. As a point of reference, for a 10 x 10 foot bathroom, you'll need about 1 or 2 cartridges. It's usually smart to buy a little more caulk than you think you'll need — you can always save this left-over caulk for later.  

use latex caulk for delicate indoor jobs.  use acrylic latex caulk for long-term projects.  use silicone caulk for tough jobs and extreme temperatures.  don't mix different types of caulk.  use a caulking gun for large projects and tubes for small ones.  clean your floor and baseboards.  keep the area free of obstructions.  have water or a household cleaner and several rags handy.  lay down masking tape before beginning to caulk.  cut a hole into your caulk cartridge's point.  pierce the cartridge's inner membrane.  load a cartridge into your caulking gun.  if inexperienced with a caulk gun, practice first.  caulk the tops of the baseboards.  smooth the caulk with your finger.  caulk the bottoms of the baseboards.  pull your masking tape before the caulk dries.  ensure proper ventilation.  wear gloves if desired.  handle knives with care.  don't eat or inhale caulk.  protect the caulk while it "sets".  fix any minor errors by hand.  clean up.  understand where caulking is appropriate.  understand the time commitment of caulking.  understand the costs associated with caulking. 

 Using an A4, 8.5x11 inch letter size piece of paper, turn the paper vertically. Make a 1-inch fold horizontally along the top of the paper. Repeat this 8 times, folding each time on top of the previous fold, for eight folds. The paper will now be about half the size it was before.          Make sure the folds are lined up exactly on top of one another and tightly folded. The creases should be sharp and crisp. To achieve a sharp crease, use your thumb or a blunt-edged tool, like a wooden depressor or a butterknife.  Before you fold, flip the paper over. The folds should not be visible after you flip it over. Now, fold the paper in half along the vertical, matching the edges of the paper exactly. The folds will now be visible.  Leaving around 1/2 inch to an inch at the bottom, fold over the top of the paper. Repeat this on the other side, making sure the crease is even along the top of the plane.          The folds should be on the bottom of the plane. The kite plane is capable of great distance and accuracy. 

make a 1-inch fold.  fold the paper in half.  fold the wings. 

; , This is generally done by a coin toss and the winner will get preference over choosing the topic or the side. There are two government teams and two opposition teams. You will be versing not only your side's opposition, but also the other government team.  The topics are random and the sides are called "government" and "opposition" or "proposition" and "opposition". Government is supporting the topic given and opposition is opposing it. The topic will always request government to argue for a change (argue to change something that currently exists), while opposition will argue against the change. Another type of motion does not require a change. This motion will have the word "believe" in it. Here, the government defends a view or belief while the opposition opposes it., You have these few minutes to prepare your speeches. This is often very nerve-wracking,, This is in the form of a .question, and cannot last more than 15 seconds. Be careful not to offer them more than every 15 seconds as this is called "barracking" and is perceived as extremely rude  ,, There will be two opening teams - the Opening Government and the Opening Opposition.  They must define every important term in the topic. They must define them carefully, because should s/he introduce fail to do so, side opposition may define those terms in any way that best suits it. (i.e., define the house, define the meaning of the resolution, etc.) Next, the Prime Minister will introduce any contentions (points you wish to use to prove your case) s/he wishes to do. It is imperative that the Prime Minister sets a clear and narrow resolution so that the debate is focused and no too broad. The time limit is generally 5 minutes.  S/he must refute (prove incorrect) every contention the Prime Minister just made and introduce any contentions s/he wishes to do so. The time limit is generally 5 minutes.  S/he must refute every contention the Member of the Opposition just introduced, rebuild (re-prove) the Prime Minister's contentions and introduce any additional contentions s/he wishes to introduce. The time limit is generally 5 minutes.  S/he must refute every contention of side government, rebuild all of side opposition's contentions and introduce any additional contentions s/he wishes to add. Sometimes, it may be against the rules to introduce new contentions in this speech in the last minutes of the speech. It is also, generally, a good idea to summarize all the points of the opening opposition (the Leader of Opposition and his own points) in this speech, as the Leader of the Opposition is the last person of his side to speak. The time limit is generally 8 minutes. , S/he must present an extension to the debate that was done by the opening sides. That is to say, S/he must open a new side about the issue. This is 5 minutes.  S/he was to refute the points of the Member of Government, as well as bring in another extension. This is 5 minutes.  S/he is to refute the points of the Member of Opposition. Then, s/he has to sum up the debate and crystallize it to some main points. This speaker may not bring in ANY new points/extensions/case studies. This is 5 minutes. The whip speeches are very important, and it may seem that they have nothing to do during prep time, but they should always be thinking about their case as a whole.  S/he will refute, but may not introduce new contentions. Lastly, s/he should summarize all the contentions made by his/her side and possibly provide mention what the debate was mainly about. S/he was to do the same thing as the Government Whip. This is 5 minutes. Whip speeches are like a biased newspaper report; they lay out their arguments in a way that makes it look like their team has won the whole debate.  

organize four teams of two people.  decide which team gets to get to pick whether it will choose the topic first or the side to argue for.  there are generally 3 topics and 2 sides.  you and a partner receive your topic around 10 minutes before the debate begins.  points of information can be given to the opposing side when they are speaking.  for every debate, the first and last minute are protected time, where you cannot make any points of information.  ,  first the opening sides debate.  one person on side government, called the prime minister, speaks first.  one person on side opposition, called the leader of the opposition, speaks next.  one person on side government, called the deputy prime minister, speaks next.  one person on side opposition, called the deputy leader of the opposition, speaks next.  the closing sides now debate.  ,  the member of government now speaks.  the member of opposition now speaks.  the government whip speaks.  the opposition whip is the last speaker in the debate. 

 Plastic combs can be safely sanitized in either rubbing alcohol or apple cider vinegar. Fill a cup or bowl that's big enough to hold your comb with vinegar or rubbing alcohol. Let the comb soak for 10 minutes. Then, remove the brush or comb and rinse it out under running water., You only need to soak the head of a brush to disinfect it. Add a mixture of one part white vinegar to one part water to a bowl big enough to hold your brush's head. Then, soak the brush's head in the mixture for 20 minutes.Rinse the brush under running water when you're done.  Brushes and combs should be air dried on a towel. Times will vary depending on the type of brush or comb. Some will take a few hours to dry while others may need to dry out overnight., Handles of brushes and combs also come into contact with a lot of germs. You should clean them as well during the disinfecting process. Cleaning depends on the material of your brush or comb, but you can swab down most surfaces with rubbing alcohol to wipe away any residue. You can then rub down the handles with a damp cloth.It may be best to avoid harsh cleaners, like rubbing alcohol, on wooden brushes.  

submerge plastic combs in vinegar or rubbing alcohol.  soak the head of a brush in vinegar to disinfect.  let your brush or comb air-dry.  clean your handles. 

 Most clippers come with several snap-on plastic guards. The guards ensure an even trim at the length you want - no one wants to cut their beard too short.          If you're not sure which of two guards is best, start with the longer attachment first. You can always go back over the beard with a shorter guard afterward, but if you trim too short, you'll have to wait for the hair to grow back. Refer to your manufacturer's instructions for details about the various trim guards and speed settings on your trimmer. If you want to shave your beard completely, leave the guard off.           Maintain balance between each side of your face by always starting at the ears and working down. The guard should keep the trimmer from irritating your skin or cutting too much hair.  Start under your nose and move toward the corner of the mouth, then proceed down to your chin. Pay special attention to hard-to-reach areas directly under your nose.          Keep your mouth closed to avoid a mouthful of hair! Depending on the length of your beard, it may be easier to trim the mustache separately with scissors.  Remove the guard from the trimmer and trim along your neckline to remove the remaining hair on your neck. Use your jaw as a straight edge.   If you like, you can also lather and shave your neck, depending on how you like it styled. Some prefer a clean cutoff line for their beard, while others prefer subtle neck stubble.  

select a guard.  turn the trimmer on and with a gentle but firm pressure, trim each side of your face, working along the grain using long smooth strokes.  trim your mustache and chin.  finish the trim with a clean edge. 

 When you get a new dog you shouldn't feel like you need to introduce it to your neighbors right away. Instead, let it get used to its new surroundings and its new family first. Once the dog has a steady routine and has gotten comfortable around you, then you can introduce it to the neighbors.   Waiting to introduce your new dog around will also allow you the time to figure out how it feels about strangers. If it is super friendly and easy going, then introductions will not be an issue. If it is guarded and fearful or aggressive, then you will need to do more work around how to respond when meeting new people.; , Check to see if it knows commands and whether it will follow them reliably. Once you understand what your dog can and will do, then you will know better what to expect when introducing it to others.   If your dog doesn't know commands or will not respond to them reliably, then you will need to do some training with the dog. Many people use positive reinforcement and repetition to get a to reliably respond to commands such as sit, stay, and lay down.  You want to make sure that you have physical control over the dog before the introduction. Put a collar or harness on the dog and hook a leash to it. Make sure you can hold on to the dog even if it goes wild or gets overly energetic.Harnesses can be great to use on dogs that have a lot of energy and can pull a lot. If attached correctly they hold the dog very well and the dog cannot wiggle out of them like they can with a collar. Keeping the dog on leash also protects the dog from getting loose and lost in a new neighborhood., Before the meeting you can tell your neighbor how to interact with the dog for the first time. This may include highlighting the fact that calmness in them will promote calmness in the dog and that contact should be made gradually.Give the neighbor a treat for the dog ahead of time and tell them the commands you would like them to give the dog before giving it a treat. You may also want to tell the neighbor to avoid direct eye contact with the dog initially. Direct eye contact can be read as aggressive by a dog., If your new dog is agitated or temporarily ill behaved, then it is not the right time to have an introduction. Make sure your dog is in a good mood, fully fed, and tired out from exercise before introducing it to a new person.Instead of just meeting the neighbor by chance, make a plan to meet intentionally. This will allow you to make sure the time and place is right.  Dogs can get territorial in their own space, so it's best to have a meeting with someone new at a location that is neutral. This could be a park or backyard that the dog has never been in, or it could simply be on a the sidewalk away from its house.If you must have the meeting at your home, you will run a greater risk of having the dog exhibit territorial behavior towards the neighbor.  It is important to keep your dog on leash and keep a good hold of the leash while the dog is meeting someone new. Since the dog is new to you, you will not necessarily be able to identify the signs that it is going to misbehave before it does it. This means that you should keep a strong hold at all times in case the dog's mood or behavior changes suddenly.   Even if the dog is behaving well, keep a hold on its leash. Your dog should learn that you are in charge and you holding onto the leash will signal that.  If your dog has a hard time meeting new people, you will need to take the interaction slowly. You will also want to make it possible for the dog to approach the neighbor, not the other way around.   Your dog should first be given some time to see the neighbor from a distance.Then you should bring the dog close enough to smell the neighbor but not make contact. Then, if all is going well, you can allow physical contact. This usually includes the dog sniffing the neighbor. It can be a good idea to meet up with the neighbor while going for a walk. If the dog continues to move while the new person comes into their space, they are less likely to resist it., If your dog is aggressive towards the neighbor then you should delay the meeting until you can train the dog more. There is no use in exposing your neighbor to an aggressive dog. Instead, take it as a learning experience and focus your energy on dog training and behavior management.   There are some dogs that take a bit of time to warm up to new people. If you know this about your dog and you are sure that it will warm up to the neighbor, then you can continue the introduction. Just be sure to warn the neighbor about this beforehand and make sure that they are fine with doing a little bit of work to befriend the dog.  When introducing your new dog around, you want to be sure that it does not get overwhelmed. You also don't want to put it in a situation where it is likely to act badly or fearfully. With this in mind, introduce a new dog to only one or two neighbors at a time.   Slow and intentional introductions can set up lifelong quality relationships between your dog and its neighbors.  Make sure your dog doesn't have a biting or snapping fear response before introducing it to a child. New dogs that are scared may show fear by snapping or biting.   This fear response can injure a child that doesn't know to take caution with a new dog.  If your dog is well behaved and friendly to your neighbor then it should be rewarded with a treat or a fun activity for its behavior. Giving the dog positive reinforcement will help assure that it behaves the same way the next time it meets a new person., If your dog doesn't react to strangers in a way that you want it to, then you will need to spend some time training it. This is usually done with positive reinforcement and consistency. Specifically, you will need to get your dog to reliably respond to commands and you will need to introduce it to a wide range of people so that the experience becomes normalized.   If your dog is actually aggressive with strangers, as opposed to scared or hesitant, then you will need to go about this training more strategically. The dog may even require the expertise of a professional dog trainer.  Part of training will be making sure that your dog is comfortable with people, including strangers. This is called "socialization."In order to do this you should lead by example, showing over-the-top kindness and joy when meeting people and showing affection. If your dog sees you welcoming new people, it is more likely to exhibit this behavior as well.   Ideally, socialization should begin when a dog is a puppy. However, it is never too late to socialize a dog and make it comfortable meeting new people.Tell people that you are meeting up with or who are coming to your home about the situation. Make sure they model friendliness and joy with you and the dog. If you have a dog that has been trained to guard, then it will harder to get it to be friendly to strangers.  

let your dog settle in.  practice commands with the dog.  place a leash on the dog.  instruct the neighbor how to act.  pick the right time.  have the meeting in a neutral location.  keep a hold of the dog.  allow the dog contact slowly.  delay the meeting if aggressive behavior occurs.  take multiple neighbors into account.  use caution with your dog and neighbor children.  reward positive behavior.  give consistent training.  promote friendliness with people.

 There is no one way to process grief. Lots of people struggle, thinking they should be feeling some particular way that they're not feeling. This can cause a lot of guilt, making things worse. If you're not sure how to act, try not to worry about it as much. Do what feels natural.   Death is an inevitable part of life. Dealing with loss is never fun, but it doesn't have to be the sombre affair that many make it out to be. Find time to laugh in the face of death, if it's possible. Find the humor in a bleak situation.  Having a people around you can help bring your overall mood up, even if you're not doing anything in particular. Talk about what you're going through, or talk about other things that are on your mind.   Share memories of the person you've lost. Talk about the good times and share stories. Look at old pictures. Reminisce. Sometimes, it's better to avoid talking about the person or pet who died too much. It can be a good way to feel better for a while, but it can also just make it more depressing. Also take the time to talk sports, or movies, or anything else that comes up.  You may need time to yourself. It's great to stay social, to reminisce, and to go through the process. But it'll be different for everyone. Try to find a personal and particular way to grieve for the person you lost.   Think of the relationship you had with this person. What did you share? How can you commemorate that relationship? What could you do that would make you feel better?  , Let grief make you busy, and let your business make you happier. Spend your time focusing on an obsession or an interest. Get busy being productive, and let your grief turn into productivity.   If you love sports, practice your sport several times a week. Sweat out your grief. If you love fashion and beauty, start a blog and write about clothing or products. Explore new ways of enjoying your passion. If you enjoy playing instruments, learn a new song, or pick up a new technique that you've been meaning to practice. If you love learning and school, educate yourself further by devoting your time to your studies or watch the news. Head to the library.  Just being around people can be instructive while you're grieving. Go to public places as much as you can. Instead of making coffee at home, grab a cup at a local spot. Instead of reading the paper at home, read it at the library. Go to a movie instead of staying in and watching TV.   It gives you perspective to notice that everyone is able to just go about their day, even though someone you love has died. Life goes on and the world keeps spinning, even without that person.  

don't worry about doing it the "right" way.  surround yourself with people who care about you.  find your own way to grieve.  get invested in something you love.  get out of the house regularly.

 If you are experiencing pain or other side effects from ovarian cysts, then it is important to let your gynecologist know. Your gynecologist may advise a “wait and see” approach, also known as watchful waiting. Your gynecologist may also want to do an ultrasound a few weeks after you become aware of the cyst to see if it is still there., Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen can provide relief for painful ovarian cysts.Make sure that you read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions before use. Talk to your doctor if you are not sure what or how much to take.  Sipping a cup of herbal tea may also help to relieve some of the pain caused by ovarian cysts. The warmth of the tea can help to relax you muscles and serve as a nice relaxing distraction. Some good teas to try include:Chamomile Peppermint Raspberry leaf Decaffeinated green tea  , A heating pad applied to your lower abdomen may also help to relieve some of the pain caused by ovarian cysts.You can use either a hot water bottle or an electric heating pad. Place the heating pad on your lower abdomen for about 10 – 15 minutes at a time.   Take breaks in between uses to avoid overheating your skin.  A stressed state of mind may make pain seem worse, so try to take some time for yourself and relax as much as possible while you are dealing with an ovarian cyst. Some good stress relieving activities include:Playing with a pet Going for a walk Taking a bubble bath Writing in a journal Calling a friend Listening to music Watching a funny movie  , If cysts are large or if they are causing other symptoms, then surgery may be necessary to remove them. Surgery may also be necessary if there are concerns that a cyst may be cancerous. Surgery for ovarian cysts may be performed using:Laparoscopy — For smaller cysts, the surgeon can make a small incision and remove the cyst with the help of a laparoscopic camera.  Laparotomy — For larger cysts, it may be necessary to make a longer incision to remove the cyst.

 PST stands for Personal Storage Tables. When they get too big they often get corrupted, leading to errors. They can, however, be fixed. It isn't incredibly difficult, but you still want to make sure the other two methods didn't work first. They are simpler and less invasive. That said, using a PST repair program is not very difficult, and is generally safe. Even better, Microsoft bundles a repair program right with Outlook called Inbox Repair., For Windows Users, you may have a program called "Scanpst.exe" that will do this for you. For Mac users, you may not have the option to use Scanpst. In this case, you must go search online to download an "Outlook PST Repair" program.   Sites like CNET have Outlook PST Repair programs for free. Scanpst is sometimes hidden. To find it, copy the following into a search bar: Program Files\Microsoft Office\. Then click OFFICE and scroll to Scanpst., Head back to the Account Settings (either through Tools or File → Info) and click on the tab labeled "Data Files." You'll see a list of all your email address. Click the one with the issue and then select the button "Open File Location." This will open a window showing your .pst file on your computer.\   Remember this location on your computer -- you'll need it later.  Now that you know where it is, click on "Browse" or "Load PST" and cue up your Outlook file. On some programs, you may be able to just click and drag it over from your old file.  The first step is a scan of your PST files. More likely than not, it will then offer to repair them. Click "Repair" to fix up your old file, which should prevent any further issues.   Repair will automatically create a backup of the PST file, so don't worry about losing old data., Once you've repaired your old file, simply drop it next to the old one. Remove the broken file, putting it in a new, separate folder for safe keeping in case something went wrong. If you're having trouble syncing up the new file, simply return to the "Data Files" screen in Account Settings. From there, you'll find the button "Add File" on the left-hand side. Click it to add your new PST file.   Leave the folder containing your PST files open while working. This will make it much easier to find later on. 

try the previous two methods before attempting a pst fix.  open your pst repair program.  open outlook to find the location of your pst files.  return to your pst repair program and locate the .pst file you just found.  hit "start" and follow the on-screen instructions.  open outlook with the new pst file. 

 If you are trying to record gameplay from an older console without a capture card, your best bet may be using a video camera or your smartphone's camera app. You won't get perfect quality, but you'll still be able to record what you're playing.   If you're using a smartphone, you'll have trouble picking up the sound from your TV. If you can, consider purchasing a capture device instead. These are external devices that you simply plug into your computer, making them much easier to install than a capture card. You will be able to record at the best picture and sound quality if you use a capture device. If you're playing a much older system, such as an NES or Sega Genesis, you may want to record with a VCR. This will lead to a better quality recording, and with the right equipment you can transfer it to a computer.  The key to a good recording is to ensure that the entire frame is filled with the TV image. Try to position the camera in such as way that it is looking directly at the TV, and that the frame is filled by the TV image. Move the camera a little closer so that the edges of the TV are just barely cut off. This will ensure that the entire frame is full.   Make sure that you aren't pointed at an angle, or you'll likely pick up some glare.  If your video camera or smartphone uses digital zoom, avoid using it for filming your gameplay. Digital zoom will result in a blurry final video, and you need as much clarity as possible when filming this way.  If you're using a camcorder, you may be able to route the game audio through the camcorder's input. You'll need a converter for the console's audio cable so that it can plug into the input or line-in option on the camcorder. This isn't possible on most smartphones.   Another possibility with a camcorder is setting up a microphone next to your TV speaker to pick up the game audio more clearly.  Make sure that no lights are shining directly onto the TV screen. You don't want to make the room completely dark, or the TV image will glow too much. As long as lights aren't pointing directly at the TV screen or camera, you should be good.  The worst thing you can do for clarity is to try to hold the camera while the game plays. Your camera needs to be absolutely steady, or it will be very hard to see the gameplay. Use a tripod if possible. If you don't have a tripod, set the camera or phone on a level surface and stabilize it with books or other heavy objects.  When the screen is dark, you may appear in the TV reflection if you are sitting directly in front. Sit off to the side while recording so that you don't get caught in the reflection.  Once you're finished recording, transfer the video to your computer so that you can edit anything out that you don't want in the video. This is usually useful to cut out the setup process or to remove boring parts. Since the sound recording probably wasn't very good, you may want to replace the sound completely with a soundtrack. After you're finished making your edits, you can upload the video to YouTube or keep it on your computer  

know when to use this method.  frame the tv completely in the camera.  avoid using the zoom.  connect the audio to the camera (if possible).  dim the lights.  use a tripod or other stabilizer.  sit to the side while playing.  transfer the finished video to your computer for editing and uploading.

 You will need three cups, soil, tape, a marker, paper, a shoebox, seeds, aluminum foil, one straw, and water. Organize your materials on a table or desk for easy use. You can pick any seed. Some good options are corn, lima bean, or radish. You can substitute a shoebox for another medium size box.; , Use the marker to label each cup. You can use the labels “A, B, and C” or “1, 2, and 3”. These labels will help you identify the plants throughout your experiment., First, remove and discard the lid and one side of the shoebox. This will allow light to enter from an angle. Next, line the remainder of the shoebox with aluminum foil. This prevents it from getting wet when you water the plants. Place the shoebox on a windowsill or on a table in front of a window., Be sure to use the same kind of soil in each cup. Leave the soil loose. If you pack it too tightly, the seeds will not be able to grow well., Follow the planting instructions on the seed package. These instructions will differ depending on what plant you choose. For example, some plants might need to be an inch deep and others may need to be three inches deep., Turn a faucet or spigot on so that a small steady stream of water is flowing. Move the cup back and forth under the water until the soil looks wet. Do not overwater the soil. It should just be damp to the touch., The cups need to be side by side in the shoe box. This is how the light will be controlled for the experiment. Always keep the same cups in the same place. Moving them around will mess up your results.Once you place the cups in the box, you will not need to remove them. The seeds will sprout, and the plants will grow facing the direction they choose.  The shoot cap will prevent light from shining on the tip of the plant. The cap can be made by surrounding the top half of an inch of a straw with aluminum foil. The cap should be a cylinder that is half an inch tall and has a covered top.One half inch equals 1.77 centimeters.  Base caps will not cover the top of the plant, but will cover the stem instead. To make this kind of cap, you should wrap aluminum foil around a straw. Do not cover the top or bottom of the straw. The base cape should be a cylinder with no covered top or bottom, and should be roughly half an inch long., The plants will need to sprout before you cap them. This will take different amounts of time for different plants. Once the plants sprout, you should let them grow to be half an inch tall., Once the plants have grown about half an inch, you need to put the assigned caps on them. Place a shoot cap on plants in cup A (or 1). Use base caps for plants in cup B (or 2). Place no caps on plants in cup C (or 3). The third cup is a control group., As you monitor the plants over the next days and weeks, make note of which flowers lean toward the sun and which ones lean away from the sun. The flowers in cup A will likely grow straight up. The flowers in cups B and C will likely lean toward the sun. This happens because the light is detected at the top of the shoot, and the flower grows in the direction of the light. When you cover the top of the shoot with a shoot cap, the plant cannot detect the light and grows straight up. 

gather your materials.  label the side of each cup.  line your shoebox with foil.  fill each cup about ½ full of soil.  plant the seeds.  water each plant.  place the cups in the box by the window.  make a shoot cap.  make base caps.  let the plants grow.  cap the plants.  analyze the plant growth. 

 Decide on at least four different colors of embroidery floss. These should be left in their original six-strand form and cut to about 24 inches (61.0 cm) long each.  Tie all your strings in a small knot at the very end. Then, braid them for about three inches and tie them in a second knot. You have just created one of the ends that will be tied around your wrist. Tape or pin this knot to a tabletop or your pant leg.  Lay your strings out flat, leaving a bit of space between each piece. Start on the left side and tie basic knots across each string by laying your first string in an “L” shape over the string directly to the right. This should create a “4” shape. Take the end of this string and loop it underneath the string to the right, pulling the end through the center. This should create a loop around the 2nd string, which you should pull taut to the top of the strings. Repeat steps to finish the knot.  Using the same string that you started with, work your way to the right side of the strings by tying knots around each of the adjacent threads. When you get to the right side (after tying knots over all the strings), let the thread go and start again on the left side. Continue the same pattern you started by starting with the 2nd thread, working until you get to the right side. Eventually you will work your way across all the strings with all four of your threads, and start the pattern over again with the original 1st thread. Make sure to keep pulling the threads taut to the top of the bracelet, so that your finished product is sleek, smooth, and flat.  Stop your weaving pattern of the bracelet when the the striped section is long enough to wrap around your wrist. Tie a knot at the end, and then braid a 3” section of string past the knot. Knot the end of this braid to create the second tie for your bracelet.  Tie the bracelet around your wrist and show it off.         

choose your strings.  start your bracelet.  start your pattern.  continue your pattern.  finish your bracelet.  wear your bracelet.

 Before you begin skinning the chicken, it’s important to ensure that your work area is ready to go. Wash the cutting board or other surface that you plan to skin the chicken to ensure that you don’t contaminate the chicken. Once the surface is clean, set the chicken on the cutting board with the breast side down.When you’re working with chicken and other meats, a plastic cutting board is usually the best option because it’s easier to sanitize and doesn’t trap bacteria as easily.If you’re washing a plastic cutting board, a chlorine-based cleaner, such as a bleach and water solution, works best. Add a tablespoon of bleach per gallon of water to create a cleaner that you can use for up to two weeks. For washing a wooden cutting board, a quaternary ammonium-based disinfectant is usually the best option. Dilute a quaternary ammonium product, such as Mr. Clean, with water according to the directions to create a cleanser for your board. Make sure to dry your cutting board completely before setting the chicken on it.; , With a long, sharp knife, begin separating the skin from the other tissue at the neck of the chicken. You’ll need to slide the knife beneath the skin to separate it from the rest of the chicken. Continue working your way along until you reach one of the wings beneath the skin.It’s best to use short, precise cutting motions as you work to free the skin from the chicken, especially if you want to keep the skin intact.  When you reach the first joint of the wing, use your knife to slice it and free it completely from the skin. Remove the wing bone and its meat from inside the skin and continue cutting the rest of the wing free from the skin, turning it inside out to make it easier.Once you’ve freed the wing that you’re working on, repeat the entire process with the other one.  Once you’ve freed both wings, you can continue to loosen the skin from the breast of the chicken. If you don’t need the skin for another recipe and don’t care if it remains intact, you can use your knife to carefully slice it free along the breast, thigh, and back of the chicken.If you want to keep your chicken skin intact, use a tablespoon instead of a knife to separate the skin from the meat. Slip the handle of the spoon between the skin and the meat to split them, but work carefully. While the spoon handle is dull, it can still tear the skin if you’re not careful. Leave areas that won’t easily separate alone.  The area in the middle of the chicken’s back is usually especially tough, so you need to take time to carefully cut it free with your knife. Work slowly and carefully, pulling back the skin as you go to make the process easier. Make sure to go as high as the skin allows to fully separate it from the meat on the back.If you’ve used a spoon to help separate the skin from the breast area, you’ll need to switch back to a knife to cut away the skin at the middle of the back. The spoon just isn’t strong enough to free the skin in that spot. If you don’t want to damage the skin, keep your cuts small to avoid cutting it.  Once the skin is completely loose around the breast and back area, use your knife to cut the skin that covers the end of the bone in each thigh. Once you’ve cut the skin at the end, continue to use your knife to separate it from the thigh meat.Make sure to slice completely around the bone at the end of the thighs to ensure that the skin is free all the way around.  Once the skin is separated enough, you can remove the thighs. Slice each one at the hip joint to ensure that the thighs are loose enough. Using your hand, snap each thigh at the joint to completely sever it from the chicken. Next, pull the thighs free from the skin, and place them on the cutting board.It’s important to use a sharp enough knife to cut through the hip joints. You may want to sharpen yours just before this step to ensure that it’s capable of doing the job.  Once the thighs are removed, you’re ready to completely separate the skin from the chicken. As you’re working it free, pull on it back from the neck almost as you would pull up on sock. If you find any areas where the skin is still attached, use your knife to carefully separate it and then continue pulling.If you’re removing the skin simply to make your recipe healthier, discard it in the trash. If you need the skin for a certain recipe, follow the instructions for what to do next.  

place the chicken on a clean cutting board.  start cutting the chicken skin at the neck.  cut the wing free at the first joint.  separate the skin from the meat over the breast area of turkey.  slice the skin on the back free.  trim the skin around the ends of the thighs.  cut the hip joints and snap the thighs free.  pull the skin completely free from the chicken. 

 Your loved one may be fine in one area, but have difficulty in another area. Make a list of the specific areas that need attention. Most of the needs will fall into 5 major categories.Housekeeping- laundry, shopping (e.g. groceries, toiletries, household items), yard work and cleaning Meal preparation Healthcare Activities of Daily Living Social needs - transportation and interaction with other people  , Once you have made a list of the areas that need attention, write down who will be responsible for each area. Will it be you, a friend, family member, home health professional, or a community organization? If you are relying on a friend or family member, make sure you get a specific commitment from the person and the services they have agreed to help with.   Support will likely come from multiple sources. For example, you may come clean the house once a week, and another relative may grocery shop and prepare some quick meals. To find local community resources in your area, call 411 and say the specified business you're looking for.You can also ask their primary care physician for referrals to services in your area. Depending on the situation, the elderly can sometimes qualify for home services such as physical therapy or nursing visits.  Ask your loved one if they have organized their important documents and medical information. If they have not, encourage them to do so and offer your help. If they have already organized their documents, take a look to see if everything is complete. Important documents include:Health insurance and/or Medicare card Social Security card Birth certificate List of health conditions, medications, and allergies End-of-life care, will, living will, and power of attorney Insurance policies (e.g. life insurance, long-term care insurance, etc.) Financial information (tax documents, financial advisor, accountant, bank information, etc.) Name and contact information for physicians and pharmacies  , Your loved one's needs will change over time due to many different factors. Your loved one may have a health crisis that requires acute care. There may be changes in you or your loved one's financial status. You may experience changes that affect your availability as well.You may want to evaluate your plan at regular intervals (e.g. 3 months, 6 months, etc.). See what is working and what is not working. Do not forget to include your family members, care givers, and loved one in these evaluations. Make planned and unplanned visits to your loved one's residence to get a picture of how everything is going.  

identify the areas that need support.  determine who can provide support in each area.  organize important documents.  adjust the plan as needed. 

 Making sure that the corners are perfect, use a triangle ruler, measure and draw a rectangle that measures 16" x 36". You can add a seam allowance if you'd like. Cut along the lines and you have your pattern.; , Lay your fabric down and make sure it's smooth with no wrinkles. Put your pattern over top the fabric, and pin it down to keep it in place. Cut right along the edges of the pattern. You should have a perfect 16" x 36" rectangle of fabric.  Make markings 10" from the short ends of the fabric, on each side. If you don't have marking chalk, you can cut a small snip in the fabric to mark it.  Thread your sewing machine, making sure the needle is sharp. Set up your iron and ironing board for pressing the hems.  Measure and fold down 1/4" along the short ends of the fabric, folding the wrong sides together. Press with iron, and repeat so that the raw edge is enclosed.  Keep your stitches as close to the loose edges as possible. Repeat on both ends.  Fold the hemmed edge of the fabric in toward the center until you reach the mark you made 10" from the end. Make sure the fabric is folded with the right sides together. Repeat for the other side. The hems should overlap each other in the center. Pin the sides in place.  If your sewing machine has a zig zag setting, zig-zag the raw edges to keep them from fraying.  This sets the stitches into the fabric. Turn the pillow right side out and then press all around the edges.  Or you can buy a 16" x 16" pillow form to place inside!  

create your pattern.  cut your fabric.  mark your fabric.  get ready to sew.  press the hems.  sew the hems down.  fold your fabric.  sew seams in both edges, making sure to remove the pins as you reach them.  press the new seams.  use over your couch pillows, now that your pillow is complete. 

 All the fruit should be ripe (or even overripe)--ripened fruit is sweeter, so you won't need to add any extra sugar., Use a small, sharp knife to cut the core out of the strawberries.   Insert the tip of the knife into the top of the strawberry, right where it turns white. Cut out the white center of the strawberry. In doing so, you will remove the leaves as well.  The taste might not be as intense or fresh, but it will still be delicious!   Clean the blender after use, since you will be using it again for the peaches and the kiwi.  This should catch all the strawberry seeds so they don't end up in your frozen lolly.,   You can substitute another sweetener for simple syrup. Try honey, agave nectar, or maple syrup. Sample a little of the puree to make sure it's sweet enough. If not, add a little bit more sweetener, to taste.    If you don't have an ice pop mold, you can substitute a paper or disposable plastic cup. Don't try to substitute a glass for the pop mold--as the juice freezes, it expands, and it may break the glass. This will ruin your pop and make a dangerous, sharp mess in your freezer.  This should take 1 1/2 to 2 hours.Cover the mold with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. If the molds came with covers that double as a handle/popsicle stick, wait to use these. If the first layer of your ice lolly freezes around the stick, you won't be able to add the next two layers.  If you don't have fresh peaches, you can use canned peaches that are already peeled, stoned, and sliced. Just drain the water from the can.  Your blender won't have to work as hard to puree the fruit if it's cut into little slices. Using a paring knife, cut all the way through one side of the peach, until your knife hits the pit.Run the knife all the way around the peach, keeping the blade against the pit, cutting the peach in half.Hold the peach in your hands and twist each half in opposite directions until the come apart. The pit should still be stuck in one half of the peach.Remove the pit with your fingers or the tip of the knife., If it's not sweet enough, and a little simple syrup until it's to your liking.   Clean the blender so it will be ready for the kiwi puree.  Only fill the mold another 1/3 of the way to the top.Cover the mold with tinfoil or plastic wrap.   Make sure the strawberry puree is completely frozen before you add the peach puree, or they will mix together. This will probably taste good, but the effect of having 3 individual sections of flavors will be ruined.  This should take another 1 1/2 to 2 hours., Make sure you remove all the fuzzy skin and discard the top and bottom tips., Again, you may want to taste the puree to make sure it's sweet enough.  Don't let the kiwi spill out of the top of the mold, or your lollies will all freeze together. Leave a little room at the top so you can insert the handle and give the puree a little room to expand as it freezes.  Usually, molds come with a lid that also acts as the handle. You may have to push it into the already frozen part of the lollie.   If your mold didn't come with a lid, you lost the lid, or you're using cups instead of store-bought molds, cover the top tightly with aluminum foil. Insert a popsicle stick through the aluminum foil. Make sure it is straight. It's okay if you have to push it into the frozen peach layer to make sure it's secure.    Test that the juice is completely frozen by wiggling the handle of one of the pops. It should be firm in the juice and not move at all. You can run warm water over the sides and bottom mold to help release ice lollies in one piece--just don't loosen them from the handle!, After you've enjoyed these frozen treats, consider experimenting with other flavors. Try to stick with fruits that are all in season at the same time for the most harmonious flavors.Spring and summer fruits include blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, boysenberries, grapes, melons, nectarines, plums, peaches, and pluots.Blackberries, apples, kiwis, dates, kumquats, peaches, pomegranates, and raspberries are all in season during late summer and fall.Try grapefruit, kumquats, limes, mandarins, and pomelos in the winter.Oranges are in season all year long. 

ask an adult to help you prepare the fruit, since you'll need to peel and slice the fruit.  hull the strawberries.  puree the hulled strawberries in a blender.if you don't have fresh strawberries, it's ok to use frozen.  place the strainer or sieve over a bowl and pour the puree through the strainer.  add 1 1/2 tbsp simple syrup to the strawberry puree and mix.  pour the sweetened strawberry mixture into your ice pop molds, filling only 1/3 of the way to the top.  put the mold in the freezer until the strawberry mixture is frozen.  peel the skin off the peaches with a peeler or knife.  remove the pits from the peaches and slice into small pieces.  puree the peaches in the blender and add 1 1/4 tbsp simple syrup.taste the puree to make sure you like the flavor.  pour the sweetened peach puree into the ice lolly mold.  put the mold in the freezer until the peach mixture is frozen.  peel the kiwi with a knife or peeler and slice into smaller pieces.  puree the sliced kiwi and 1 1/4 tbsp simple syrup in the blender.blend out all the chunks for a smooth and thick mixture.  pour the sweetened kiwi mixture into the ice lolly mold.  top the mold with the lid.  put the mold in the freezer for another 2 hours, or until the kiwi mixture is frozen.  your finished ice lollies should be equal layers of pink, yellow, and green--just like a traffic light! 

 Extreme temperatures and temperature shifts can result in malfunctions.   Your iPhone might alter its functional behavior to regulate its internal temperature which can result in various glitches, from a reduced battery life to any number of issues. Being aware of this fact can help you improve your phone's responsiveness. Here are a few things to keep in mind:  Use your iPhone in acceptable temperatures: between 32 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit (or, between 0 and 32 degrees Celsius). Store your iPhone in temperatures between -4 and 113 degrees Fahrenheit (or, between -20 and 45 degrees Celsius). Don't leave your phone in a parked car when it's hot outside. Don't expose your phone to direct sunlight for an extended period of time.  ; , Try not to use up every last bit of memory your device has. Leaving your iPhone with a little breathing room can increase your phone's performance.   A good guideline is to leave your phone about 250MB of free memory space. To see how your iPhone's storage is being used, open Settings, tap General, tap Storage & iCloud, and then tap Manage Storage under the "STORAGE" section of the menu. Try deleting some application data to free up some of your iPhone's memory.  It's the gray app that contains an image of gears (⚙️) and is located on your home screen.  It's near the top of the Settings menu.   Backup requires a Wi-Fi connection.  It will turn green.  Select a network from the list that appears under the "Choose a Network" section of the menu.   Enter a password, if prompted to do so.  If you're still on the Wi-Fi settings screen, tap Settings in the upper-left corner to return to the main Settings screen.

It's near the top of the menu, next to a gear (⚙️) icon.  It's at the bottom of the menu.  It's near the top of the menu.  Enter the passcode you use to unlock your phone.   If prompted, enter your "Restrictions" passcode.  Doing so will reset all settings, as well as erase the media and data on your iPhone.   Your phone will show “Swipe to set up” after it’s done deleting your content, as it did when it was first purchased.  Your iPhone will be in same configuration that it was when it left the factory, so you will need to set it up as if it were new.   During setup, you will be asked if you want to restore your phone from an iCloud backup. If you want to add all your media, data, and apps back onto your phone, restore from the backup with the most recent date and time.  If your device goes completely black, and appears to be turned off, try the following tips.   Press the Home button. This will, in some cases, resolve the issue.

 Your passwords to access your accounts on apps or websites should consist of a combination of numbers, upper- and lower-case letters, and special characters that is difficult to guess.  Don't use the same password for more than one website or account. This limits the damage to you if a hacker happens to crack one of your passwords.; , Password managers store and auto-fill your credentials for different sites, allowing you to create a complex and unique password for each site without having to worry about entering the password itself more than once. While you should absolutely keep track of you passwords on your own as well, a password manager will help make your device much more secure.  Highly praised third-party password managers include "Dashlane 4", "LastPass 4.0 Premium", "Sticky Password Premium", and "LogMeOnce Ultimate". Most browsers have a built-in password manager that stores and encrypts your passwords.  This is an obvious piece of advice, but one that bears revisiting: with the exception of some school services, you shouldn't ever have to provide a site administrator with your password for them to access your account.This logic applies to IT workers and Microsoft or Apple representatives. Similarly, don't tell people your phone or tablet's PIN or passcode combination. Even your friends might accidentally tell someone your passcode. If you do have to give someone your password for some reason, change it as soon as they are done with whatever they needed to do on your account.  In addition to keeping your password a secret, you should change the passwords on your various accounts and devices at least once every six months.   Be sure not to use the same password twice (e.g., your Facebook password should be different than your bank password, etc.). When you do change your password, you should change it substantially. Don't simply replace one letter with a number.  Two-factor identification requires you to enter a code sent to you in a text message or another service to access your account after you enter your user name and password. This makes it more difficult for a hacker to access your information, even if they are able to crack your password.  Most major websites, including popular social media networks, have some form of two-factor authentication available. Check your account settings to learn how to enable this feature. You can set up two-step verification for your Google account. Popular app alternatives to receiving a text message include Google Authenticator and Microsoft Authenticator.  Any company that has information from you must have a privacy policy that details how they use that information and the extent to which they share it with others.Most people simply click through the privacy policy without reading it. Although the reading can be cumbersome, it's worth at least skimming it so you know how your data is being used. If you see something in the privacy policy that you disagree with, or that makes you uncomfortable, you may want to reconsider sharing information with that company.  Simply closing the browser window isn't always enough, so make sure you click (or tap) on your account name and select Log Out (or Sign Out in some cases) to manually sign out of your account and remove your login credentials from the site.  Phishing scams – instances in which a malicious page pretends to be a login page for a social media or bank account – are one of the easiest ways for you to get hacked. One way to spot phishing scams is to look at the site's URL: if it closely resembles (but doesn't exactly match) a reputable site's URL (e.g., "Faecbook" instead of "Facebook"), it's a fake site. For example, enter your Twitter login information on Twitter's official page only. Avoid doing so on a page that asks for the login information in order to share an article or something similar. An exception to this rule is when a university uses an existing service (e.g., Gmail) through their home page.  

create complex passwords.  use a password manager.  don't give out your password.  change your passwords often.  use two-factor authentication.  read privacy polices carefully.  log out of accounts when you're done with them.  make sure you're on an official website when entering passwords. 

 Inspect your shed’s entrance for gaps between the door and its frame. If any are present, seal the door using weatherstripping or a draft strip.Pay special attention to the entrance’s corners. If the shed is large enough, and if you’re brave enough, get inside, close the door, and see if any light is visible where the door meets its casing.; , If your shed has windows, apply a silicone or acrylic latex caulk to seal any gaps in the casing. Check the roof’s soffits and fascia boards, and use caulk to seal any cracks you find.Inspect the shed’s structure regularly to make sure no gaps or cracks have formed, and reapply caulk when needed.  Some sheds feature vents and other openings, such as entry points for utility wires. Use the finest wire mesh you can find to seal vents (preferably 1/16 inch or 1.5 millimeter). Plug any utility holes with caulk, expandable foam, or steel wool.Wear gloves when cutting and installing wire mesh, since the edges are razor sharp.  

install a draft strip and weatherstripping at the shed’s entrance.  caulk windows and any cracks or gaps.  seal any vents and utility holes.

Furthermore, do not post comments saying that the Angry German Kid has mental problems or needs help that "can't be acquired from the Help and Support Center". He is a very talented actor who simply wishes to entertain people. Also, it is not true that his father secretly videotaped him while he was on the computer to send the recording to a mental hospital. This was made up by the German media. Comments mentioning this will be deleted.  The message may take up more than one screen if necessary.  The Angry German Kid video starts off with the Angry German Kid arriving at his computer and shouting at it to turn on. For this part, it is best to write something along the lines of Come on computer! Load up!. Then, the Angry German Kid should say what he wants the computer to do (e.g Load up Internet Explorer! or Start up the Pinball game! so the viewer understands what the video is about., There should then be a screenshot of the program that he has launched if you were able to acquire one. Following this, the Angry German Kid is now excited and his excitement shows. The Angry German Kid should make progress in whatever task he is doing, building up to the climax., The Angry German Kid video contains two parts of keyboard smashing: a short part when the Angry German Kid encounters a minor error but fixes it with "positive thinking, and a major part in which the Angry German Kid severely damages his keyboard and leaves." For the former, you should create a minor error that the Angry German Kid quickly fixes., The second part of keyboard smashing occurs at the end of the video when the Angry German Kid leaves. A major error should take place here. The major error is commonly a Blue Screen of Death. The Angry German Kid should then make some comments about Bill Gates before leaving., Export your video and upload it to a video hosting website such as YouTube., The warning that you added to the actual video is not enough.

 Lie down on a fitness mat on one side of your body. Your legs should be stacked on top of each other.Bend your knees.  Place your upper arm’s hand (arm furthest from the mat) behind or at the side of your head. Place your lower arm’s hand either extended straight out from your body, or on your thigh or abdomen., Exhale and contract your abdominal oblique muscles to lift your upper body off the mat and crunch.Try to crunch to your side as high as possible, aiming to get your elbow as close to your thigh as you can.Pause and hold the crunch for a brief moment before inhaling and coming back down to your starting position.To make this exercise more challenging, lift up your knees simultaneously as you crunch. To make it even more challenging that that, you can straighten out your legs and simultaneously lift both of them up as you crunch., Once you have completed about one set of crunches (about 10–15 reps), flip over to lay on the other side of your body. Get into the same starting position you did before, with your knees bent and your arms in place, and complete a set on this side of your body.   Do 1–3 sets of 10–15 reps on each side of your body. Try to do these crunches about 2 or 3 times a week.  

lie down on the floor.  position your hands.  crunch to your side.  complete your crunches on the other side of your body. 

 Shut the slats.  Follow the instruction manual for the method of removal. Be sure to keep an eye on any loose pieces and not lose them.  Fold it back where it is too long. Ensure that the blind is fully covered by warm water. Add a simple cleaning solution, such as dish detergent or bleach.  Scrub gently with a soft cleaning brush. It the blind suffers from a deep build-up of grime, it may need to soak overnight.  Empty the cleaning water. Either use a bucket to slosh fresh water over the blind or run the shower over the blind until all soap residue is removed.  outdoors if the weather is fine. Allow to dry. If needed, a hairdryer set on cool can speed up the drying process.

 Whatever type of position you have available, there are probably military veterans with skills and experience that are directly relevant to your needs. During their service, veterans receive training and experience in teamwork and leadership, and many veterans build experience in non-combat jobs., The job you are offering may have a military equivalent. For example, computer programmers work in all military branches, while a sales manager position might be related to military recruiters and navy counselors.Visit the Civilian-to-Military Occupation Translator at http://www.careeronestop.org/businesscenter/civilian-to-military/civilian-to-military-translator.aspx.   When you search with the Civilian-to-Military Occupation Translator, you will notice that military jobs each have a military code. For example, 79R refers to an enlisted army recruiter.Refer to relevant codes when advertising for applicants.  Because veterans often face barriers when searching for employment, the federal government offers a federal tax credit to employers who hire military veterans. The maximum tax credit varies from $1,200 to $9,600, depending upon the employee.To apply for the tax credit, you must submit two forms to your state's workforce agency within 28 days of the employee's start date. The forms are IRS Form 8850 and ETA Form 9061 or 9062.You can find additional instructions at http://www.doleta.gov/business/incentives/opptax/wotcEmployers.cfm#HowDoIApply.  Transitioning veterans receive a "permanent change of station allowance" from the Department of Defense, and many are willing to use their allowance to move themselves and their families to the location of their next job. Therefore, you should not feel restricted to your local geographical area when searching for qualified applicants. You may find interested and well-qualified applicants who are willing to relocate over a considerable distance.  A good job description should inform potential applicants of the job title, the location of your business, the tasks to be performed, and any required education and experience.Specify also that veterans are encouraged to apply.   The U.S. Department of Labor sponsors an online job description creator at http://www.careeronestop.org/businesscenter/jdw/gettingstarted.aspx. Simply answer the questions, and the program will draft a job description for you. Also consider including the military code of any military job that is analogous or relevant to the position you are advertising.  You can speak to a Veterans Employment Representative by calling your local American Job Center. The representative can help find qualified veteran applicants to fill the position.

; , Put on gloves if desired.  Some models have a circular jack pad behind either of the front two tires attached to the chassis. Otherwise, find a solid member of the chassis to apply the jack. On an M3, there is a cross member running from left to right behind the front wheels that is a good place to apply the stand DO NOT jack up your car by applying the jack to a part of the suspension.  Apply the stand to a solid part of the chassis, then slowly release the jack allowing the car to rest on the stand. Repeat for the other side.  It will most likely be a 17 mm nut. Place the oil pan beneath the plug. Use a socket wrench to remove the plug and washer. It can help to apply inward pressure on the plug when removing it to avoid spilling hot oil.  Some people remove the jack stands and lower the car to ensure all of the oil drains as the car is leveled.  Clean the oil plug and place the new washer that came with the filter on it. Getting back under the car, replace the plug. Do not over tighten. It should be torqued to about 18 feet (5.5 m)-lb. Remove the oil pan and lower the car, removing the jack stands.  On these cars the filter is under the hood, making it easy to change. Usually it requires a 13-mm socket wrench, but double check to make sure this is the right size. As with any nut, you want to avoid stripping it.  Replace with your new filter. Apply new, clean oil to the new o-ring before replacing that as well. Torque to around 16 feet (4.9 m)-lb.  Check with your dealer to see how much oil your car requires depending on the size of the engine. Replace the cap, remove any tools, and start the car. After a few minutes check underneath to ensure that there are no leaks and turn the car off. Check the oil level on the dipstick. It should be between the two notches. If it is too low, add a small amount, run the car again, and shut it off to check the oil level until it is right.  Do not dump the oil.  

drive your car until it reaches running temperature to assist in the flow of the oil, which is less viscous when warm.  park your car on a flat surface and open the hood.  find a solid place to apply the force of the jack to lift the car.  jack the car up high enough to slide the jack stands beneath.  get under your car and locate the oil plug on the bottom side of the engine.  allow around 20+ minutes for the oil to drain completely.  open the new oil filter.  remove the cover of the oil filter housing.  using gloves and a towel, remove the filter from the canister.  using the funnel, fill the engine with new oil through the filler cap on top of the engine.  clean up and dispose of oil at an oil depository, such as an auto parts store, a garage, or a public depository. 

 A combination circuit has some components linked together in series (one after the other), and others in parallel (on different branches). Look for areas of your diagram that simplify to a single series or parallel section. Circle each one to help you keep track of them.  For example, a circuit has a 1 Ω resistor and a 1.5 Ω resistor connected in series. After the second resistor, the circuit splits into two parallel branches, one with a 5 Ω resistor and the other with a 3 Ω resistor.Circle the two parallel branches to separate them from the rest of the circuit.  Use the parallel resistance formula 1RT=1R1+1R2+1R3+...1Rn{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{R_{T}}}={\frac {1}{R_{1}}}+{\frac {1}{R_{2}}}+{\frac {1}{R_{3}}}+...{\frac {1}{R_{n}}}} to find the total resistance of a single parallel section of the circuit.  The example circuit has two branches with resistance R1 = 5 Ω and R2 = 3 Ω.1Rparallel=15+13{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{R_{parallel}}}={\frac {1}{5}}+{\frac {1}{3}}}1Rparallel=315+515=3+515=815{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{R_{parallel}}}={\frac {3}{15}}+{\frac {5}{15}}={\frac {3+5}{15}}={\frac {8}{15}}}Rparallel=158=1.875{\displaystyle R_{parallel}={\frac {15}{8}}=1.875}Ω   , Once you've found the total resistance of a parallel section, you can cross out that whole section on your diagram. Treat that area as a single wire with resistance equal to the value you found.  In the example above, you can ignore the two branches and treat them as one resistor with resistance 1.875Ω.  Once you've replaced each parallel section with a single resistance, your diagram should be a single loop: a series circuit. The total resistance of a series circuit is equal to the sum of all individual resistances, so just add them up to get your answer.  The simplified diagram has a 1 Ω resistor, 1.5 Ω resistor, and the section with 1.875 Ω you just calculated. These are all connected in series, so RT=1+1.5+1.875=4.375{\displaystyle R_{T}=1+1.5+1.875=4.375}Ω.  If you do not know the resistance in one component of your circuit, look for ways to calculate it. If you know the voltage V and current I across that component, find its resistance using Ohm's Law: R = V / I. 

break down your circuit into series sections and parallel sections.  find the resistance of each parallel section.  simplify your diagram.  add up resistances in series.  use ohm's law to find unknown values. 

 No one likes being next that guy at the gym - either on the treadmill or in the weight room - who seems to be over-exaggerated his breathing. Intense huffing and puffing can be distracting to others, so focus on how you're breathing to control and regulate your breath.   Focusing on your breath will help bring your attention to the sound, depth and rate of your breathing. This can help keep you a little more quiet, but may even improve your workouts.When you're lifting weights, fitness professionals suggest that you exhale as you contract a muscle or muscle group and inhale when you're relaxing from the contraction.For cardio, your breath should be steady and even-paced. Studies have actually shown improvements with running when the beginning of your exhale coincides with the strike of your heel on the pavement. Breathing during stretching and recovery may actually be the loudest type of "workout breathing." Breathe in deeply and fill your whole abdomen up with air. Avoid lifting your shoulders up and down - this is ineffective. Try to breathe slowly and deeply as this promotes more oxygen in your lungs.; , Your downstairs neighbors probably don't appreciate hearing you jumping up and down for your morning workouts. Focus on the proper, safe and quietest methods of jumping to decrease the overall noise coming from your workouts.   Landing softly and correctly not only helps quiet your workouts, but also decreases the risk for injuries. Landing incorrectly may lead to a blown out knee or a sprained ankle.One of the most important aspects of landing appropriately and softly is flexibility. As you land, bend your knees. At the end of your jump or landing, you should almost be in a full squat position. Also, always begin your landings on the ball of your feet, slowly rolling back towards distributing your weight on your entire foot. This method of landing also helps force you to flex your knees and encourage the squat-like position in your landing., Another time you might find yourself making a lot of noise is when you're jogging or running on a treadmill. The way your foot falls may sound like a very loud splatting or thudding noise. Proper running form is naturally more quieter and safer.When you run more naturally, fitness professionals say your stride and footsteps are much more quiet. In addition, you reduce your risk of overuse injuries caused by excessive impact.Many runners have been told to run "heel to toe." However, now fitness and running coaches are suggesting that you hit the ground midfoot instead of at the heel.The next time you're out for a jog or run, focus on where your foot naturally falls and aim to hit the ground midfoot and roll forward to your toe to push off again. Also make sure that your foot falls underneath your hip, not far out in front of you. This helps over striding (which can lead to injury) which makes running louder.  If you're a regular in the weight room or have invested in your own home gym or free weight sets, make sure you're mindful in how you're using them and setting them down. This is where a lot of noise can be made.   If you're using free weights, it's important to set them down gently on the rack, floor or bench. Letting them drop from your hands or pushing them off of you after completing a repetition makes for loud, banging sounds. This misuse of the weights can also lead to damage of the floors, the weights themselves and if they land on your foot, an injury for you. When you're using a weight machine at the gym or at home, aim for slow and controlled movements. It may be natural for you to finish a repetition and then release the weight and have it slam back to original position. Even when releasing a contraction or finishing an exercise, it's equally beneficial to your body, progress and the ears of other gym members to finish slowly. The release of an exercise works your muscles just as hard as the contraction, so there's a benefit to not letting the weights fly out of your hands., Some exercises require the use of a yoga or fitness mat (generally out of comfort). However, these thick, foam pads may also help dampen the noise of your workouts as well.   If you don't have one, consider purchasing a yoga mat or fitness mat. They come in a variety of thicknesses, so choose one that works best for your typical exercise routine. However, the thicker the mat, the more sound and shock they will absorb.These mats can be used for many, many exercises - not just a typical yoga routine. You can do cardio exercises on them - especially if you're at home doing a cardio DVD, walking video or doing at home HIIT (high intensity interval training) exercises. They're especially great for plyometric exercises like jumping jacks, squat jumps and burpees as they can help make for a softer landing, but also absorb more shock and sound when you land. However, be careful when putting your mat on a hard surface (like wood floors) because the mat can slip.  If you want to stick to a regular strength training routine, but are looking for a quieter method, consider doing yoga. This is a naturally quieter form of exercise but can be great for strength.   One of the reasons yoga is more quiet is that there are no explosive movements, no plyometric jumping or use of any free weights or weight machines. In addition, yoga requires the use of a mat (or at least a carpeted floor) which also absorbs the shock and sound from exercise.Yoga helps strengthen, lengthen and tone muscles. It requires you to control and focus on your breathing and uses very slow and controlled movements. All reasons why this is a more quiet form of exercise., Running or jogging, especially on the treadmill, is going to be a little noisy. There's only so much you can do to dampen the sound of your feet. However, think about doing other forms of cardio instead.   If you're interested in doing some at home cardio or are looking to purchase a cardio machine for your apartment consider a stair master, elliptical or stationary bike. These machines make some noise as they are being used, but its very minimal. In addition, these machines are more low-impact and there are not hard landings when you're using them. This also makes them a better choice for those with joint or knee pain.  Another option for strength training is using free weights or calisthenics. As long as you control how you're doing these exercises (especially free weights), its much quieter than using a home gym or weight machines.   When using free weights, make sure you set them down quietly, instead of dropping them on the floor. Otherwise, these are incredibly quiet and won't disturb neighbors or others at the gym. Calisthenics are exercises that use your own body weight for resistance (often known as body weight exercises). They require little to no equipment and are very, very quiet.Examples of strengthening exercises you can do include: push-ups, crunches, planks, tricep push-ups and squats.  Although there are a variety of exercises that do not make much noise, there are some types of exercises or programs that you should avoid due to noise.   Many HIIT (high intensity interval training) workouts contain a lot of plyometric exercises - which makes them great at burning a lot of calories and building muscle. However, if you're jumping around a lot for a workout, your neighbors or roommates might not appreciate all the noise. If you use a treadmill in your apartment or home as well, you might want to consider limiting its use early in the mornings or in the evenings when others around you may be sleeping.  Even though you're aiming to keep your workouts on the quieter side, still aim for the required 150 minutes of cardiovascular exercises each week.Even quiet aerobic exercises still provide a vast array of health benefits. These types of exercises work your heart and lungs and can help reduce the risk of high blood pressure and diabetes, improve your mood, help maintain a healthy weight and reduce your risk for developing heart disease.150 minutes or about 2 1/2 hours is the minimum you need to do each week. You can split this up into small bouts. For example, a 10 minute workout or walk 3 times a day Monday through Friday will help you reach this goal. Choose quieter activities like: using the elliptical, walking on the treadmill, using a spin bike or walking DVD's. Also consider asking your neighbors or roommates when a good time for you to do louder exercises would be. You can do a plyometrics routine or longer run on the treadmill if no one is around.  In addition to cardiovascular exercises, it's also important to stay regular with strength training. Most professionals recommend to do these types of exercises about 1 or 2 times per week.This minimum guideline helps provide additional health benefits to the ones provided by cardio. Strength training specifically helps strengthen bones, builds muscle mass and supports your metabolism.Things like yoga, calisthenics and free weights are great options to include if you're looking for a quieter routine.  Another great way to add in physical activity to your normal routine is to increase your lifestyle activity. Most of these are done away from the home so you don't necessarily have to worry about making much noise.   Lifestyle activities are those that you do on a typical day. It might be walking to the mail box, sweeping the floor or taking the stairs to your office. Although some of these activities do cause noise, they're part of daily living and don't last a long time. Some studies have shown that lifestyle activity, when increased, has similar health benefits to more structured cardio (like going for a jog).Try to increase the amount of movement or steps you take in a day. Focus on activities outside the home so you can continue to keep a quieter environment where you live. For example, take the stairs to your office, park farther away, use a bathroom on another floor, take a walk break over lunch or even skip emails and deliver messages to co-workers in person.  Rest days are also important to your physical activity routine. They not only help your body recover and rest, but may be a great way to give your roommates or neighbors some quiet time.   Studies have shown that its actually during rest that your muscles grow in size and strength. Without rest days you won't make very much progress with your exercise routine.Most fitness professionals recommend at least one, maybe two rest days per week. You should still be active - maybe going for a walk instead of a run - but need to avoid more high impact or higher intensity workouts. Try to schedule rest days when your roommates or neighbors are around or home more often. For example, if people sleep in later on Sundays and want to enjoy a quieter day, schedule a rest day for Sunday so it coincides with other's schedules.  

focus on your breathing.  land softly when jumping.  run and walk more quietly.  be mindful with weights.  use a fitness or yoga mat.  try yoga for strength and flexibility training.  use the elliptical, stationary bike or stair master for cardio.  go for free weights and calisthenics.  limit high impact exercises.  aim for 150 minutes of cardio exercises per week.  include 1-2 days of strength training.  increase your lifestyle activity.  take active rest days. 

 Garnet's hair post-Jailbreak is a bit smaller than it was before. A large wig will still do the job, though.  Sewing will be pretty much unavoidable with this version of Garnet. Buying a cosplay online might be your best bet if you can't sew and really want to cosplay this version.  Cut them both exactly down the middle and sew them together as one, with blue on the right and purple on the left. If you can, use the remaining fabric to sew the bottom half of Garnet's shirt; that way you won't have to worry about matching colors.  You'll need a pale pink or dark blue top as a base, then hot pink and red to create the star, which is at the lower left of the chest. The sleeves could be recreated with styrofoam.  Garnet has deep purple gloves, which stop at the wrist save for her third finger. Get a cheap pair of long gloves and cut them out in this pattern.  Shoes could be a bit of a challenge. You might want to buy shoes specifically for this cosplay or get subtly colored shoes that blend in with the leggings.  As always, Garnet has a great pair of shades in this incarnation. They cover her whole forehead along with her eyes and appear to have a pink and blue tint, but normal sunglasses are good nonetheless.  

get a wig.  prepare to sew.  get deep blue and deep purple leggings.  recreate the shirt.  get the gloves.  get the shoes.  get the shades. 

 When you are walking with your dog around bodies of water, keep them on a leash. This protects them from running off into potentially dangerous water, especially before you have a chance to make sure it is safe.A leash also protects them from other dangers, like predators and getting lost or separated from you.  Taking your dog with you on my your boat, kayak, or canoe can be fun for you and your dog. However, your dog may be at risk if the kayak or canoe flips, or if your boat capsizes. To help protect your dog, even if they are a good swimmer, put a life jacket on your dog any time they are in a boat.You can find pet life jackets at pet stores.  Before you let your dog free in the lake, river, or ocean, you should figure out if they can swim. If they cannot, then don’t force them into the water. You and your dog can have fun splashing around.If your dog is new to water and swimming, get them used to water slowly. You may consider swimming lessons from a professional dog trainer.  If you have your dog in your boat, consider putting a pet ramp on the boat. This helps your dog be able to get in and out of the water easily so you can keep them safe while still letting them have fun swimming.Always help your dog in and out of the boat, even if you have a pet ramp. Always watch to make sure they’re safe.  

keep your dog on a leash.  place a lifejacket on your dog.  make sure your dog can swim.  put a pet ramp on your boat. 

 Do research into the type of laptop you need or want. Ask yourself questions like, What will I mostly be using this for? What programs will I use? How much storage space do I need? With these needs in mind, compare prices on laptops with the features you want.Try looking at the refurbished or used laptops that brands and retailers sell for very reduced prices.Create your own comparison chart of prices and features of several possible laptops, or find and print one from online to show your parents that you’ve given this a lot of thought and research.; , Consider what you can do in exchange for your parents buying you a laptop. Promise good grades on your next report card, a certain amount of chores per week or month, or another goal you know your parents would like to see you achieve.   Try coming up with a specific goal that you can stick with and achieve. When you talk to your parents, you can say, “I’ll get a better grade in English next semester,” or something that you know could use improvement and that you think you can achieve., Think of all the ways that a laptop would make your life easier or more successful. When the time comes to talk to your parents, point out to them your practical reasons to have one, as well as the benefits of a laptop over a desktop, like portability, convenience, and that it doesn’t take up space.   For school, think of how you could use a laptop to take notes (if allowed), to bring to study groups or tutoring, or to access online libraries and other reference resources. If you’re off to college in the near future, you can point out to your parents that you will need a laptop for notes, research, and to make video calls home!Some students actually do better in school with laptops if they have a very slow handwriting speed or other difficulty taking notes. If you struggle with this, use this in the argument you bring to your parents., Think of an argument for how you can use a laptop to cultivate useful talents and beneficial hobbies. Want to get into graphic design? Computer coding? Writing? You need a laptop to learn and practice these skills that could later become jobs.   Show your parents that there are lots of educational resources for free online that you would be able access on a laptop and have more time and freedom to use than on a school or family computer., Display to your parents that you don’t use your current family or personal computer too often, so you won’t be on your own laptop all the time. Commit to cutting down on your screen time, if necessary, in advance of talking to your parents, so that you can point out to them your good habits when you sit down to talk.   Try getting on the computer for only a half an hour at a time, or only when all your homework is done at the end of the day.  Compile all your research, reasoning, and offers for a laptop and write them down neatly or type them up into a document to print out for your parents. Show them you are responsible, have given this a lot of thought, and are willing to stick to your goals to own your own laptop.   You can even create your own “contract” or agreement for whatever you offer in exchange for a laptop, so you can track your progress and let your parents hold you to your goals., Talk to your parents in a calm, patient, and respectful manner when you bring up the subject of wanting a laptop. Make sure to explain why you want one, what you’re willing to do to get it, and how much you would appreciate their help in buying it.   Try asking like this: “Hey Mom and Dad, I’d really like to get a laptop of my own. I know I don’t have enough to pay for all of it right now, and I was hoping you could help me out and give me your permission to get one. I really appreciate the things you’ve bought or helped me buy in the past, and I think this will be something that’s useful to me and worth the money."  , Offer your parents the research and reasoning you’ve written out. Give them time to look it over and discuss any questions or comments they have about it.   If you’ve created a contract or agreement, you can have them make edits or additions and tell them you can all sign it when you’re in agreement, to make it official.  Listen carefully to the reasons they might have for hesitating or being unwilling to buy you a laptop. Avoid reacting with anger, whining, or impatience, because they will be even less likely to agree or even talk about it with you.   If their concern is the cost, talk to them about paying for part of it or paying them back over time. If they think you’re not old enough to have your own laptop, mention a friend your age who has one.  Show that you understand that a laptop is an expensive investment, and you’re willing to pay for part of it, if you have the money, or pay them back for all or part of it over time. Use money from an allowance or job, or discuss other ways that you could earn money and pay your parents back if possible.   Try offering to match funds with your parents if you have some money saved. You can say, “I only have . If I contributed that, would you be willing to pay the rest?”, Discuss with your parents any limits they may want to put in place if you do have your own laptop, like where you can use it, how long you can be on it, and what you can do on it. Consider giving in to them setting parental controls on the laptop or other measures they feel they need to take.   You might agree to only use the laptop in your living room while at home, only use it for schoolwork and internet instead of games, or another similar compromise. Also discuss any consequences there would or should be for losing or damaging a laptop. You could offer to pay for a durable case or cover to ensure it doesn’t get broken, or even chip in on insurance for it if your parents want to help you look into that option.  After laying out your whole argument and discussing options with your parents, give them time to consider it. Wait patiently for them if they need more time to think it over or do their own research on the best laptops and prices.   You can even say to them, “I just wanted to tell you all this now, but I don’t need a yes or no right away. Come back to me once you’ve had time to think it over.”If your parents do say no, accept their answer and don’t fight it. Show your maturity and let the subject drop for now. You can bring it up with them in a few weeks or months with a new angle or argument, or agree with them on a time that they might be more willing to consider your offer.  

research and compare laptop costs.  come up with an offer or bargain.  come up with practical reasons for a laptop.  plan to use the laptop for hobbies and skills.  show moderation in your computer usage.  put your offer in writing.  ask nicely and show gratitude.  show them your written argument or contract.  talk through their concerns.  discuss the cost and consider a payment plan.  agree on limits.  be willing to wait.

 Find the items in the supermarket, along with the following information for each one:   Weight of item Serving size Calories Total fat Saturated fat Carbohydrates  , Ask which one is cheaper, per unit price.  Many supermarkets have sections with pet food, laundry and trash items, personal care, and baby diapers.    List five of the most favorite vegetables and check the prices of each category. List five vegetables that was eaten fresh, but not canned or frozen. List three vegetables they would prefer eating in each category over another category (for example, eating russet potatoes over canned potatoes or frozen corn over corn on the cob). 

name one favorite food from each food pyramid section.  compare two fruit juice brands with the same weight.  name 20 non-food and non-drinks.  compare fresh, frozen, and canned vegetables.  find a kid's breakfast cereal with the least amount of sugar.  

 Try different things; any number of things. You may accidentally find your own niche, just that way. Some suggestions are:    Macro shots of parts of the trees Lying on the ground, looking up Interjecting yourself someway into the photo Landscape shots Photographing the root system if they are showing Photographing the ground cover. You would be amazed at what is in the undergrowth (in a forest, anyway).; ,, Then start moving around the tree getting different angles.  That will really help your photography grow, just watching the changes. How you shoot will change from time of day to time of year.  If you are going to be taking photographs and you want them to be good ones, know something about the tree. What is its optimum point for photography or wildlife, or anything else. Knowing the tree will help you to know what time of the year and what time of the day will be best.  Otherwise, it's just a picture of trees somewhere. No sense in size, location, etc. If you can make the tree the focal point, by all means, do so.  

experiment.  start by photographing the trees far enough away that you see the view that is around the tree or trees.  ,  start getting closer.  come back at various times of the day, and different times of the year to get more photographs.  know your trees.  be sure that you have a focal point: something to which the eye is led. 

 You can get condoms without a prescription at your local drugstore. Often they are located in the medical supplies aisle or the personal health aisle of the drugstore. You do not need to provide ID to buy the condoms and they are often not very expensive to purchase.You can also find condoms for sale at your local gas station or at the supermarket. There are usually a variety of condoms at these outlets in a variety of condom sizes. While it can be embarrassing, if you have questions you can ask your doctor or pharmacist.; , Though you can easily pop out to the nearest gas station or supermarket for condoms, you may want to buy them more discreetly. Buying condoms online will allow you to access a wider variety of condoms and be able to purchase them from the comfort of your home. Many vendors will ship condoms directly to you in the mail.Before you order male condoms online, you should make sure you are buying condoms in the right size. Measure yourself and have your friends measure themselves to ensure the condoms will fit properly. Most regular condoms fit all sizes even if you are well endowed; however, it is a good idea to know your size. Some people like their condoms to fit a little tighter than others. Try different types of condoms and see which is most enjoyable for you.  You should also be able to get condoms from your school nurse. Often, your school nurse will have condoms available for free in their office. Condoms should be readily available to you at school, especially if they are promoting safe sex for teens.If you cannot get condoms from your school nurse, you can go to a sexual health clinic in your area, such as Planned Parenthood. You can also get condoms from your primary care doctor, often for free.  You can also find male and female condoms in vending machines in public washrooms. Condoms are be purchased from these vending machines for a few dollars. The condoms will be wrapped in protective plastic that you will then remove before using the condom.Before you buy condoms from the vending machine, you should check the service date on the machine to ensure the condoms are not expired. Never use expired condoms, as they may not be effective. At Pride Festivals there are always volunteers handing out condoms, and in some LGBT establishments they have free condoms available. Grab a handful!  , Condoms come in male and female versions. Male condoms are more commonly used and easier to find. Both male and female condoms work to protect both partners during sex.A male condom covers the penis and catches the sperm as the man ejaculates. A female condom is a thin plastic pouch that lines the vagina to prevent the sperm from entering the uterus. The pouch has two flexible rings, one that fits inside your vagina and one that sits outside your vagina.  You should opt for condoms that do not have any scents or flavors as these types can cause irritation or infections. You should also look for condoms that are durable and well made. You can check the label on the condoms to make sure they are made of durable materials that protect against the condom breaking during sex.Keep in mind condoms that are old or expired may be prone to breakage. You should always go for a durable, high quality option that are not expired.  Before you pick up condoms for friends, or for yourself, you should confirm that there are no allergies to latex. Latex is a material that is used in male condoms and it can cause an allergic reaction for men and women. If you are allergic to latex, you can opt for condoms made out of polyisoprene or polyurethane. Keep in mind latex allergies are pretty rare, affecting about 1% of the general population.You should also check to see if your friends are allergic to spermicide. Often, individuals with sensitive skin can react badly to spermicide. Avoid condoms that contain spermicide and go for non-lubricated condoms to prevent an allergic reaction., If you are buying male condoms, or using them yourself, you may want to go for condoms in regular size to start. Regular sized condoms are good option, unless your friends specify they would like a specific size.   If you want to be sure the condoms will fit properly, you may want to have your friends measure themselves to determine their condom size. Using condoms that are the right size will make sex more enjoyable and help to prevent the condom from slipping off during sex.Condoms usually come in small, regular, large, and extra large sizes. The sizing is based on the length and width of your penis.  Small is 1.75” width x 6.3” long (4.45 cm x 16 cm) Regular is 2.0” width x 7.9” long (5.08 cm x 20 cm) Large is 2.12” width x 7.9” long (5.38 cm x 20 cm) Extra large is 2.25” width x 8.1” long (5.71 cm x 21 cm)    , You should put a condom on your penis before you have sex. Do this once your penis is erect. Tear the packet of the condom and take it out carefully. Do not tear or rip the condom itself.Check that the condom is unrolling the right side out. If you have foreskin, pull it back. Place the condom on the top of your penis. If there is a teat on the end of the condom, squeeze the air out of it using your thumb and forefinger. Carefully unroll the condom all the way to the base of your penis. Once the condom is secure on your penis, you can enter your partner. If the condom won’t roll down, it is probably inside out. You should take it off, throw it away, and try again with a new condom. This will ensure there is no sperm on the condom when you use it.  If you are using a female condom, you should insert it into your vagina or your anus before you have sex. The condom will be tube-shaped, with a flexible ring on each end. You will place the inner ring at the closed end into your vagina or anus and let the outer ring at the open end sit outside your vagina or anus.Your partner’s penis will then be inserted into the open end of the condom, creating a barrier between your vagina or anus and their sperm. You should only use a male condom or a female condom when having sex. Using both condoms at the same time can lead to friction and rubbing, which could then cause the condoms to break. Female condoms are not as readily available and are used less often, but they are a viable option.  Lubricant can help to prevent condoms from breaking during sex. It can also prevent irritation caused by skin-on-skin friction during sex. Only use water-based lubricants that are advertised for use during sex. Often, you can find these lubricants in the same aisle or area as condoms.Do not use oil-based lubricants like Vaseline, baby oil, body lotion, or vegetable oils. These oils will weaken the condom and can lead to breakage. The pharmacy may be the best place to buy lubrication, but adult bookstores have a variety of lubricants, and some of these lubricants are more enjoyable.  Once you have had sex, you should remove the condom right away. Only use the condom once and use a new condom when/if you have sex again.If you are using a male condom, withdraw the penis while it is still erect. Hold the condom at the base of your penis and then carefully pull the condom off. Do not to spill any of the semen or allow your penis to touch your partner’s genital area. If you are using a female condom, you should carefully slide out the inner ring of the condom from your vagina. Remove the condom from your genital area, making sure none of the semen spills out on you or your partner.Always throw condoms away in the garbage. Do not flush condoms down the toilet.  You should always store condoms in a spot away from heat or moisture. Make sure the condoms are properly sealed and wrapped in the box. You may place the condoms in an easy to reach place so you can locate them before having sex, such as in a drawer by your bed.Make sure you check the expiration date on the condoms before you use them, as you should not use expired condoms.  Sometimes a condom breaks, it slips off, or it does not work properly. If this happens, you should take steps to protect yourself and your partner from STDs and from an unwanted pregnancy.The female partner can take the Plan B pill, a progestin hormone that you can get over-the-counter. This pill can act as emergency contraception and help to prevent unwanted pregnancy. It should be taken as soon as you realize the condom did not work properly or up to five days after having sex.You and your partner should also be tested for STDs. Make sure you have a clean bill of health before you have sex again to prevent the spread of STDs. Talk to your doctor about Plan B and about STD’s. Condoms do not protect from all STD’s, but they are the best option.  

go to your local drugstore.  buy condoms online.  talk to your school nurse.  look in public washrooms.  determine if you need male condoms or female condoms.  look for condoms that are unscented and unflavored.  check for a latex allergy.  go for regular sized condoms.  put the male condom on the penis.  insert the female condom.  use water-based lubricant, if necessary.  remove the condom and dispose of it once you have had sex.  store the condoms in a cool, dry place.  get emergency contraception if the condom breaks.

 If your pet has long or thick fur, check daily for any debris stuck in the coat, tangles, or mats and remove these carefully. If your pet has shorter hair, you’re likely to see these items and be able to easily pluck them from the coat. Take a few minutes to run your hands through your dog's coat from head to tail. You're looking for burs, matted hair, sticks or debris, bugs and ticks, or any other foreign item your dog's coat has acquired.  You should do this for dogs of any coat length at least once each week. While this may not seem like a significant way to improve your dog’s health and longevity, foreign debris caught in the fur can lead to a number of health concerns. For instance, an irritating substance in the fur like a bur can rub against the skin, causing rashes or sores that may lead to more serious issues, infections, or skin conditions.   Use a slicker brush that has numerous, close together bristles to detangle long dog hair. These bristles are able to slip between hairs, detangling without pulling. Use detangling solution or mineral oil to soften stubborn tangles., Cleaning dogs about once a month or every other month will help you keep their fur and skin clean and free of irritants. Dogs are susceptible to illness that can occur due to the presence of bugs, mites, ticks, and other irritants that access your pup through their skin. Bathing helps to prevent these issues, and gives you the opportunity to check your pup’s fur and skin for potential issues., When they’re too long, nails may get stuck, chip, or break. This can be extremely painful for your pup. There’s also a large vein in pet nails called the quick, and when this vein is accessed, the result could be heavy bleeding, which can be very dangerous for your dog.   To trim the nails, use baby nail clippers or clippers that are made for animals. If your pup has white nails, you’ll be able to see the quick. It is the dark pink part of the nail. If your dog has darker nails, you will need to remove a small sliver of nail at a time. After each snip, look at the newly revealed part of the nail checking for a gray-colored area. This is the quick. Stop clipping when you can see the quick.Apply styptic powder to stop the bleeding if you nick the quick.  Brushing your dog's teeth is very important. Many dog breeds suffer from oral health issues just like humans. Taking a few minutes a day or at least once a week to remove plaque is an important way to avoid these health risks. Simply apply pet toothpaste to a dog toothbrush. Then, lift your dog's lip to reveal the teeth. Carefully brush the outside and inside of each tooth.   Purchase toothpaste that is made for pets. Rather than mint, these pastes are typically flavored like foods your pet enjoys. Do not use human toothpaste, as it may be harmful to your dog. Allow your pet to get used to the toothbrush and toothpaste. Let them smell or taste the paste. Start by simply brushing one or two teeth, and seeing how your pup reacts. Start brushing when your dog is young, so they're used to the activity when they reach adult maturity. 

detangle pet fur.  brush your dog.  bathe your dog regularly.  keep nails trimmed.  care for your dog's teeth and gums.

 In order to invest in real estate successfully, you should research the subject thoroughly and be well-versed in how the market functions. There are multiple ways to invest in real estate, and you will need to evaluate your goals and finances to decide which option is best for you.   Real estate is "an interest in land" (and anything permanently attached to land). This means that the real estate market is essentially about buying and selling land and buildings. There are two types of "interest" at work in real estate: ownership and leasehold. "Ownership interest" is taking full control of and responsibility for land and buildings, and "leasehold interest" is the granting of certain rights to a tenant in exchange for rent payment. The most common form of real estate investing is purchasing ownership interest in a property and then earning money from rent paid by tenants.; , There are two main markets when dealing in real estate. These are the private and public markets. Any investing is risky to some extent, but each market has its own level of risk.    Private real estate involves the purchase of an ownership interest in "real" (as opposed to "personal") property. You or a property manager would then operate that property and you would earn money on rent paid by tenants. This is a very direct way of investing in real estate because you, as the owner, are responsible for the property.  Public real estate involves purchasing shares of a publicly traded real estate company. Often these companies take the form of investment trusts. You buy shares on the market and are paid dividends as the trust collects rent and value from the multiple properties it owns. Because you only own shares in the company, you are not responsible for the real estate. This is a less direct approach to investing.  Both the public and private markets operate on equity and debt. As an investor you pick which of those you would like to invest in.   If you are investing in debt, you lend money to someone so that they can buy interest in a property. You earn money in the form of interest payments on a mortgage. If you are investing in equity, then you are investing in ownership of the property. This means you are assuming all responsibilities for the operation of the land and buildings.  The four sectors are public equity, public debt, private equity, and private debt.   If you choose public equity, you will want to look at investment trusts. If you choose public debt, you should investigate mortgage securities, which are the debt equivalent of investment trusts, where various mortgages are bundled together to form a single investment. If you select private equity, then you will most likely be purchasing residential or commercial property and acting as a landlord. If you choose private debt, you will invest in private mortgages.  This is a variation of private equity investing, also known as flipping. The goal is to purchase a property and then turn around and resell it at a higher price.   These investors try to resell their properties as quickly as possible to minimize their costs of ownership. Most flippers will make no improvements to their properties, as they can be expensive and time-consuming. Instead, they bank on the market being favorable to them so that they can resell their unaltered property at a profit. A longer-term flip will see the investor improving the property in an effort to increase its value on the market. This form of investment can be labor-intensive and involve significant expenditures. Many such investors will own only one property at a time.

 Place 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of butter into the pan, or spray the cooking spray on the pan. Let the butter melt.  Pour 2 cups of milk or cream into the pan so that most of the chicken breast is covered. Let the milk or cream begin to boil.  Only do this once the milk or cream has reach a boil. Let the breast(s)s poach, or boil, for an additional 20 minutes.   If there is a meat thermometer handy, poach until the internal temperature of the chicken is at 165 degrees.  Make sure the juices are clear and the meat is whitish-gray.  For a balanced meal, serve with a carb or starch (like pasta or potatoes) and a vegetable (like green beans). 

turn the stove on high.  place the chicken breast(s) in the pan.  reduce the heat to medium.  cut into a thick piece of the chicken to see if it is done.  remove the chicken from the pan when it is cooked through.  finished.  

 To receive the proper treatment, a medical diagnosis has to be determined. There are many forms of anemia, and there can be serious consequences if anemia is left untreated or treated incorrectly. Before you can treat the anemia, you have to understand the cause of it. Make sure you see your physician if you are experiencing any of the symptoms of anemia so that they can determine the underlying cause and proper diagnosis.Your physician will perform a physical exam, listen to your heart and your breathing, and check for physical signs of anemia, such as pale skin and pale mucous tissues. They will also likely draw a small amount of blood to obtain a Complete Blood Count. This is a test that counts the number of red blood cells and other cells in the blood. The test will also test for the amount of hemoglobin in the red blood cells. If the underlying cause of the anemia is not clear, other tests may be ordered.  To treat iron deficiency anemia, you may need to treat the underlying condition that led to the anemia. The treatment depends on your specific condition.For iron deficiency anemia due to blood loss during menstruation, hormone treatments may be considered to lighten the flow. For anemia due to bleeding in the digestive tract, antibiotics and antacids or acid-reducing medications may be prescribed. In the case of lead poisoning, chelation therapy is used. In chelation therapy, certain drugs are used to bind to and filter out the lead.Rarely, blood transfusions may be necessary in severe cases of iron deficiency anemia. If the anemia is due to internal bleeding, surgery may be required to stop the bleeding. Other possible reasons for iron deficiency include decreased iron absorption, Celiac disease, certain foods and medications, poor response to erythropoietin, or gastric bypass surgery.  There are many different type of anemia, and anemia sometimes has generic symptoms that might be due to other conditions. This is why a doctor’s diagnosis is important. The symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include:Constant fatigue not relieved by rest or sleep Pale skin Dizziness A rapid or an irregular heartbeat Cold hands and feet Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Chest pain Cognitive problems, such as confusion or memory loss Headache  , Red blood cells contain a protein known as hemoglobin. Hemoglobin in the red blood cells picks up oxygen in the lungs and dumps out the carbon dioxide at the same time. Hemoglobin contains iron, and without the iron, hemoglobin can’t function properly. Also without sufficient iron, your bone marrow cannot make enough red blood cells, and the result is anemia. You can get iron deficiency anemia if you:Don’t consume enough iron in your foods. This can be due to poor nutrition and pregnancy. Can’t absorb the iron from your foods. This can happen with certain disorders, such as celiac disease, or if part of your intestines have been removed by surgery. Lose too much iron by some form of internal bleeding, such as bleeding in the intestine, heavy menstrual bleeding, or because of the use of certain medications like aspirin or NSAIDs that can cause internal bleeding. Have lead poisoning. The lead replaces the iron in hemoglobin, and the hemoglobin cannot carry oxygen properly. Take aspirin regularly, which can cause ulcers and lead to bleeding.  There are a number of risk factors for iron deficiency anemia. Knowing if you are at risk can help you monitor for any symptoms or increase the amount of iron-rich foods in your diet. The most common risk factors include:Gender. Women who menstruate are at greater risk because they lose iron during their periods. Those with heavy periods are at a higher risk. Age. Children and infants need more iron for proper growth and development. Intestinal conditions that prevent the absorption of nutrients. Examples of these types of intestinal disorders are celiac disease, Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and Irritable Bowel Diseases (IBD), and Leaky Gut Syndrome.Pregnancy. Being pregnant can deplete a woman’s store of iron because it is being used to help produce blood in the fetus. Nutrition. Many people don’t eat well and do not get enough iron in their foods. Vegetarians and vegans can be at risk for iron-deficiency as well, but only if they don’t include iron-rich foods in their diets.  

see your doctor.  treat any underlying causes of anemia.  identify the symptoms of iron deficiency anemia.  learn the causes of iron deficiency anemia.  determine if you are at risk. 

 First you have to stay cool. The first thing talent scouts notice is how you act when you're performing. To get a talent scout to notice you, you should be ready to perform anywhere, - the park, car wash, even a pool party. And you should perform as much as possible whenever you can or there is an opportunity.; , Next you need a band. Get all of your most talented friends together and earn money for your equipment. Get everything needed to create the effects of a star: microphone, drums, amps (just about three), three guitars - acoustic, electric, and bass as well as whatever else you might need.  It could be hip hop, rap, pop, country, rock, heavy metal, spiritual - or you could be a generalist and do a bit of everything.  Then maybe create your own show and you're done!  , If you ever feel like giving up, never in one million years give up. Not even when you reach those times like you think you're not getting any better and is not worth anything at all. , Use your imagination and the online resources. If you're in a club, ask about events they're willing for you to take part in and have fun with. This will improve not just your appearance, performance and style but your popularity. The more popularity you have, the more people will know you exist and listen to your music.  

get cool.  form a band.  decide what type of music you're going to play.  create your show.  make a video or a voice note of your progress and keep looking back to them and you'll see that you are improving and it was worth it after all.  get some dance/singing/drum/rap lessons if they're too expensive actually try working and getting involved in free clubs.  ,  get involved with every upcoming event possible. 

 When your pores are clogged with dirt, they are going to appear larger. Before applying any makeup, use a gentle cleanser to remove any dirt or oil from your skin.For best results, choose an oil-free cleanser. When you’re rinsing your face after washing, use cool or cold water. It will help keep your pores from producing excess oil so they don’t appear as large.; , Dead skin cells can clog your pores and make them appear larger. After washing your face, massage a facial scrub over your skin in circular motions to gently exfoliate and smooth your skin to ready it for foundation.To keep your pores clear, exfoliate two to three times a week. You can make your own natural exfoliating scrub by mixing three parts baking soda with one part water.Don’t use your baking soda scrub more than once a week.  Salicylic acid is an important ingredient when you want to make your pores appear smaller. It helps slough off dead skin cells from inside the pore lining so pores appear smaller. Smooth a salicylic acid-based serum or moisturizer over your face to keep your pores clear and moisturize your skin at the same time.A serum is best for extremely oily skin. A lightweight moisturizer is best for combination or normal skin. Be sure to choose an oil-free, non-comedogenic serum or moisturizer to prevent clogged pores.  Even if you’ve washed, exfoliated, and moisturized your face, your pores may still look large. Applying a silicone-based foundation primer can fill in your pores, so they aren’t as noticeable and you have a smooth canvas to apply your foundation over.Apply your primer with clean fingers so you can be sure to really work it into your pores. Opt for an oil-free, mattifying primer to keep your pores looking small all day. Check the label on your primer to make sure it is designed to minimize pores.  Any makeup that has a dewy or luminous finish calls attention to the texture of your skin, including large pores. Make your pores appear smaller by using a matte foundation that won’t reflect light and highlight your pores.Matte foundation also keeps the skin from looking shiny throughout the day, so your pores will stay minimized. Opt for a matte foundation that’s oil-free and non-comedogenic so your pores stay as clear as possible.  Brushing or smoothing foundation over enlarged pores usually causes the makeup to catch in them and emphasize their size. Instead, press and buff the foundation into your skin in circular motions. Pressing fills in the pores, while buffing helps cover them for a minimized appearance.A full, dense foundation brush is ideal for pressing and buffing your makeup in. However, you can also use an egg-shaped sponge to apply your foundation in a similar manner. Wet the sponge and wring it out before using it, though, so it doesn’t absorb too much of your makeup.  Once you’ve applied the foundation, you want to set it so your pores stay minimized all day. Use a powder puff to press and roll a translucent setting powder over your face. It will fill in any pores that your primer and foundation haven’t covered and keep your face from getting shiny.Loose powder typically works best for pressing and rolling into the skin. Pressed powder can look cakey.  Even if you apply a setting powder, there may still be some shine or excess makeup on your face that emphasizes your pores. Minimize their appearance by pressing blotting papers over your face. They’ll soak up excess oil and emollients from the surface of your skin without disrupting your makeup.   If you don’t have blotting papers, take a tissue and pull it apart so you have a single layer. Gently press it over your face to blot.  When you’re happy with how your foundation looks, it’s a good idea to apply a setting spray. Not only will it lock your makeup in place all day, it will remove any powderiness or cakiness that might occur if you use too much foundation and powder.To use the spray, hold the bottle out at arm’s length, and spritz it several times over your entire face. Different setting sprays are made for different skin types (oily, dry, or combination). Make sure you pick a setting spray that is right for your skin.  

wash your face.  exfoliate with a facial scrub.  apply a serum or moisturizer with salicylic acid.  use a silicone-based foundation primer.  choose a matte foundation.  press and buff the foundation into your skin.  apply setting powder over your face.  blot your face with blotting papers.  spritz your face with a setting spray. 

 Look for self-tightening straps to help the boots fit securely and leather soles for flexibility.You can also consider taking your dog directly to a big-box pet supply store (like Petsmart or Petco) to try on the boots in person instead of ordering a few sizes.   The ideal boot for your dog should be flexible enough to be comfortable, but tight and durable enough to stay on. It should also fit snugly at the ankle and have a bit of room at the toes for wiggle room., Once you’ve chosen a boot and selected an approximate size, loosen the straps or fasteners and open it completely before placing it on your dog.  Carefully place the boot on your dog and tuck in all of its fur to make sure none is being pulled by the boot.You can use your finger as a shoehorn to help nudge your dog’s toes to the front of the boot.  Once your dog’s paw is completely in the boot, fasten any straps. Gently press on the front of the boot to feel the clearance for your dog’s toes to see if there is any wiggle room.Try the boots on all four paws, since they may fit differently on each. A properly fitting boot should be easy to slip on, but not so loose that it slips off.  

select some boots to try on your dog.  open the boot completely.  insert your dog’s paw gently.  have your dog put all of its weight on the boot. 

 Various types of containers will work, as long as there is proper ventilation. If you want a container you can observe well, use a large, clean glass jar or other clear container. Poke some holes into the lid, or cover the top of the jar with a fine mesh fabric secured with a rubber band.Your container should be ready before you get the worms, because worms shouldn’t be exposed to the light for long. You’ll want their moist, dark home ready for them when you collect them.; , Put one centimeter of sand in the bottom of your container. Add a thick layer of damp soil, and another centimeter of sand on top of that. Then fill the jar with moist soil up to five centimeters from the top of the container. In a separate container, prepare the top layer you will put on top of the worms once you have them.The topmost layer can include pieces of overripe fruit (such as grapes), vegetable peels and leaves (from trees and/or tea).  You can search for or buy earthworms or tiger worms (redworms). Places you can catch worms are compost piles, gardens, or under rocks or leaf piles. Check the grass, sidewalk or driveway after a lot of rain. If you can’t find worms yourself, you can buy them at a local tackle shop.Keep your hands moist when handling worms. Place the worms right onto the topmost (food) layer in the container.  Store the container in a cool, dark place such as a cupboard.Put thought into where you keep your wormery. Worms like a place without vibrations.Wrap the container with black paper and secure it with string or a rubber band. Put on the ventilated lid.   For example, don’t keep your wormery near a furnace, speaker, refrigerator or dishwasher. If you’re keeping the container outside, choose a garage or shed, and wrap the container in bubble wrap as insulation, without covering the ventilated lid.  If you used a clear container for observation, such as a jar, after a couple of weeks you can examine how the worms have taken to their new environment. They have likely made patterns in the soil and processed the food you gave them. 

get a container.  create layers for the wormery.  collect worms.  put the container away.  see what the worms are up to. 

 Keep yourself healthy by eating properly as often as possible. Seek medical help and take the day off when you’re sick. Don’t push your body beyond its limits all the time. Take a break when you need one.But, if you end up eating nothing but junk food one day, don’t beat yourself up. Sometimes ice cream for dinner is necessary! We’re human, not super heroes. Showing up for work when you feel like you’re on your deathbed isn’t going to help anyone, including you. You cannot possibly be productive when you’re sick, so stay home, get better, and go back to work when you feel up to it.  Sleep is absolutely vital to a healthy life. Sleep allows us to pay attention throughout the day, and increases the amount of things we can remember. A lack of sleep can cause all sorts of problems, including depression and anxiety.Adults, in general, need between seven to nine hours of sleep every night. But everyone is different, and your ideal amount of sleep may differ from other adults.Getting a good night’s sleep also includes having a regular bedtime and wake-up time, and having a nightly routine that helps you relax right before bed. Put your electronic devices away about an hour before you go to bed and don’t look at them again until the morning. The screens on our electronic devices actually prevent our brains from being able to relax. Instead, read a book, write in a journal, or cuddle with your cat.  In an ideal situation, as an adult, you should try to get 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical (aerobic) activity every week.  Activity should be completed in intervals of at least 10 minutes.If, for some reason, you aren’t able to do this weekly, don’t beat yourself up over it. The point of these goals isn’t to make you feel guilty when you don’t meet them. The point of these goals is to help guide you in the right direction.  If you’re coming from a sedentary lifestyle, going from no activity to 150 minutes of vigorous activity may be too difficult. Instead, work yourself up to the 150 minutes over time. If you’re already an active person, there’s no reason to limit yourself to 150 minutes of activity every week. If you’re able to do more than 150 minutes, no one is going to complain!  , This can include being comfortable in our own skin, but it’s also as simple as being comfortable in your clothes. If you hate wearing high-heels, then don’t wear high-heels. If you want to lounge around all day in sweatpants, then do so. Don’t worry about what other people will think, or what the current fashion trends are. As long as you’re comfortable, that’s what’s important.  Your physical energy is the energy that physically gets you through the day, not just the energy you use when exercising. You only have so much physical energy every day, so use it wisely. Take note of all the physical activities that occupy your day and assess how important they really are to you. Drop activities that are unimportant and do not bring your any joy. Keep or increase activities that are important and make you happy.  If you gut is telling you something, listen. Your gut, or intuition, are often more right than wrong. Your gut can also help you understand where you need a draw a line — when you’re no longer comfortable with something you’re doing. There are a couple of gut-instincts that you should always try to listen to, as they’re probably telling you something important. They include:Thinking something isn’t right physically — That you may be sick, or something is wrong with how your feel, or something is different than it usually is. In all of these situations, listen to your gut. All you may need to do is make an appointment to see your family doctor and double-check that everything is okay. And if it’s not okay, you can get help ASAP.Thinking you’re in danger — Your instincts are designed to keep you out of danger. If you feel like you’re in danger, listen to yourself. Get yourself out of whatever situation makes you feel like you’re in danger. Thinking you’ve found something perfect for you — Your gut will likely be able to tell you when you’ve found the perfect shoes, or the perfect dress, or the perfect house. You could spend time evaluating all the pros and cons about your options, but if you’re gut is leaning one way, it’s okay to listen.  

nurture your body.  get enough rest and relaxation.  exercise regularly.  be comfortable.  spend your physical energy on activities you enjoy.  listen to your gut. 

 It indicates to the reader which argument you will be using in that paragraph to develop your thesis statement. You write what you are talking about and link back to the question. For example: ‘In ‘Sameness’ there was no such thing as ‘fun’ or wonderful experiences. This also made Jonas wanting to leave the community’. The two sentences before were referring to the question: ‘Discuss why Jonas wanted to leave the Community’. See how you write the question again and the topic sentence?   A topic sentence doesn’t have to be just one sentence. Try not to pass over three sentences. It is best to write about three ‘body’ paragraphs for beginners.  This means that you write ‘why’ or ‘how’ it happened etc. You tell the readers in depth (depending on time limit) why did this or that happen. You give evidence as to why you said it by explaining the situations. For example: ‘His strongest feeling was for color. He was so enthusiastic about color that he even asked his friend Asher to see whether or not Asher could see it’ – wonderful experience was color. That gives a recap on what you just said in the topic sentence. It is usually good to only write two paragraphs relating to the topic sentence depending on the time limit. So, for example, you write about the wonderful memories the Give gave him and color.  You discuss and analyze what you have just said. This can be proved by simply using a quote or a scene from the text. It’s best if you don’t use the word ‘quote’. This gives the reader an understanding of how the things you written were ‘real’ because you supported it. It is best to provide two quotes or scene in each paragraph, three or four if you have a high level. You might even have to memorize them.   For example: ‘Snowflakes. They fall, down from the sky, and they’re very beautiful’. The sentence before explains how he wants the weather to change in ‘Sameness’ and how much he loves snowflakes.  Just like what you did in the introduction and the topic sentence. You should usually start with the word ‘therefore’ but not ‘hence’ as ‘hence’ usually only refers to one object or thing. So you tell the reader ’that’s why’ something happened.   For example: ‘Therefore, color, fun, wonderful experience, weather etc. are a necessary part of life in Jonas’ opinion. All these factors contribute to making him wanting to leave the community’.  

always start with a topic sentence in the body paragraph.  discuss or explain the topic in more detail.  give some ‘real’ evidence from the text to support your paragraph that you just wrote.  conclude your paragraph - you write a sentence which links back to what you have argued about in the original question.

   Magicians are very abundant in the MS community. You can see any class of the Magician walking around all the time. Unlike bowmen and assassins, their attacks are both melee and ranged. A constant damage dealer they often have some survivability through magic guard. They are liked in Party Quests for the damage they are able to do and the skills they can contribute. Pros:  Very good damage comeback in 4th job in the form of mob skills Incredible amounts of HP and MP recovery Take damage through Magic Guard, in MP Higher magic defense Can telecast (teleport + attack skill) Heal, used by Clerics, Priests, and Bishops, defeats the purpose for HP potions Owns all the other classes at 4th job. (15 monsters at amazing levels of damage but use more mp). Most mages have mob moves   Cons:  The only 2nd job advancement attack as cleric is holy arrow, which is equal almost to magic claw. Low weapon defense Same problem with bowmen with jumpshooting Low HP Overpowered by some classes Though Magic Guard helps it so they don't die, it also costs a lot of mp, and mp is more expensive than hp to buy potions for. NOTE: monsters/bosses that dispel also dispel Magic Guard, so it requires fast reflexes to recast and avoid dying)   NOTE: Although other classes overpower Priests in 3rd class, they have a whole slew of party skills that attract the attention of all parties.  

the following describes magicians. 

 You'll need to wash one medium onion, 2 green chilies, 1 stalk of celery, and 3 medium tomatoes. Use a sharp knife to carefully dice the onion so you get 1 cup of diced onion. Dice the chilies so you end up with 1/2 cup of diced chilies. Chop the celery into small pieces to make 1/4 of a cup and chop the three tomatoes. Place all of these in a large sauce pot.You can add any of the juice from the tomatoes into the sauce pot along with the vegetables.; , Place 2 pounds (907 g) of ground beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the ground beef and stir it occasionally to break it up into small pieces. Once the meat has cooked, carefully drain off any of the grease and discard it.You can use any type of ground beef in this recipe. Keep in mind that leaner ground beef may not be as tender or flavorful as the higher fat ground beef, but it will be lower in fat.  Put the cooked ground beef into the sauce pot with the chopped vegetables. You'll also need to stir in the tomato sauce, beans, and seasonings. Stir in:1 (29 ounce or 822 g) can of tomato sauce 1 (29 ounce or 822 g) can of kidney beans (with liquid) 1 (29 ounce or 822 g) can of pinto beans (with liquid) 2 to 3 teaspoons of cumin powder 3 tablespoons of chili powder 1 1⁄2 teaspoons of black pepper 2 teaspoons of salt 2 cups (480 ml) of water  , Once all the ingredients are combined in your large pot, cook the chili on medium-high heat. Once the chili begins to bubble vigorously, turn the heat down until it bubbles gently. Simmer the chili over low heat for two to three hours.Stir the chili occasionally so that it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pot.  Taste the chili before serving it and adjust any seasonings according to your preferences. Dish up the chili and sprinkle a little bit of shredded cheddar cheese on it. You could also serve the copycat chili with:Diced green onions Sour cream Diced white onions Saltines  

wash and chop the produce.  cook the ground beef.  combine all the copycat chili ingredients.  simmer the chili.  garnish and serve the chili. 

 Find the Adverts Manager located in the top left corner. If you don't see Adverts Manager, look at the bottom of your homepage and click on Create Advert. You will need to enter your credit card details here in order to activate it.; , Once you are in Adverts Manager, click on Create an Advert. Now you will see a list of options from where you need to select your objective. Select 'Send people to your website'. Enter the URL, which will be the landing page of your website. In case your goal is to achieve an email lead, enter the page where it asks the prospective customer to enter an email.  Now you will come to a section asking you 'Who do you want your adverts to reach?' Here you can define the filters and qualification criteria of the audience you wish to target:   Custom audiences - If you have a custom list of emails or phone numbers for people whom you want to target through Facebook advertising, add them here. You can upload this list through a simple Excel file. Note that this will work only if the target audience has used these emails/phone numbers to create their Facebook account. Location - Select your country, state or town. Age - Select the age range. Gender - Select any of all, men, women. Languages - You can use language targeting as well. In case the prospective customer has entered that language in his or her Facebook profile settings, the potential customer can see your ad. Note that not all languages are available. In most cases, it is recommended that you select English (All). More Demographics - This is where you can select relationship status, educational level, work status, whether a parent or not, etc. Multiple choices are possible here. Interests - Select as required or leave blank. Behaviors - Select as required or leave blank. Advanced connection targeting - You can use this if you are the admin of the Facebook page of the website you are advertising for. For example, you can exclude people who have already liked your Facebook page by entering the name of the page in the exclude box. Thus, you will not waste your advertising on those who have already liked your page.  This should give you an idea about the approximate possible audience of your Facebook ad and you can adjust the filters and targeting mentioned above to arrive at an optimal reach.  For example, 250 per day, and enter a schedule with a start and end date. Make sure you select the correct month as well. If you want your ads to begin immediately, you can also select 'Run my ad continuously starting today'. Once approved, the ad will start and be live. You may pause it later or schedule an end date later if you want.  This is what is recommended for general use. Or, you can look at the other options of paying for impressions or setting a maximum bid per click.  Use Advert set name, by which you can name your set as something that represents the ads. For example, Company_Location_Clicks.  The recommended size is 1200 X 628 pixels. You can upload up to six images and these will create six Facebook ads. These ads will come under the same advert set. Thus, the budget of 250 per day will be spent over all of these ads. If you selected "Optimize for Clicks", the ad that initially generates more clicks is likely to take precedence.  Now you come to the section - 'What text and links do you want to use?' Firstly, connect your Facebook page if you have it. Clicking on your ad will take the user to your website but it will show as coming from your Facebook page.   Put in the headline and text of your ad. Select the call to action button. For example, you can use "Learn more". Note that there are character  limits for the text used and you will have to keep your creative text within those limits. Also note that choosing a Facebook page is required in order to include a call to action button. Now select Advanced Options and enter the news feed link description. This is limited to 200 characters and will appear only if the ad displays in the news feed. Now in the 'Advert preview and placements' section on the right, select where you would like the ad to show. For a clicks to website campaign, the news feed placement will be more productive. Therefore, it is recommended that you generally use only that. If this was an 'Increase likes to your page' campaign, you could Select All, since the like page option appears on the Facebook ad itself and it's easy to like the page on mobiles as well.  

go to your facebook homepage.  navigate to your adverts manager.  target who will see your ads.  keep an eye on the potential reach figure appearing in the audience definition column on the right side.  enter your budget.  select 'optimize for website clicks'.  set the advert name.  upload the creative images of your ads.  decide on text and links. 

 Old, stained, beaten, and scuffed up tables are great for this project. A small table, such as a coffee table, a side table, or an accent table, would be much easier to work with than a larger table, such as a desk. Metal tables are not recommended because they are more likely to chip later on.; , If the table is raw wood and not the slightest bit shiny, you can skip this step. If the table is shiny, it has a topcoat, which can cause the decoupage to come off. If you think that your table has a topcoat, sand the table down with medium-grit sandpaper.You only need to sand the parts you will be painting and decoupaging.  Dip a soft cloth in warm water, and squeeze out the excess. Wipe it across the surface(s) that you sanded. This will remove and dust or grit.This would be a good idea, even if you did not sand the table.  Start by painting the sides and legs of the table. If you plan on covering the entire tabletop with paper, leave the tabletop bare. If you plan on just adding simple cut-outs to the tabletop, you can choose to paint it or leave it bare.   Let the paint dry, apply another coat of paint, then let it dry completely. Acrylic paint and spray paint will work well for this.  The possibilities are endless here. You can cover the entire table with a large sheet of colorful wrapping paper or fabric. You can also cut smaller shapes out of scrapbooking paper, and decoupage it over a bare, painted, or paper-covered tabletop. Choose something with a nice patter, especially if you are using wrapping paper; avoid designs that make it obvious that it's wrapping paper, such as "Happy Birthday," balloons, or Christmas trees.   If you plan on covering the entire tabletop, cut the material down so that it is 1 inch (2.54-centimeters) bigger on all four sides.If you plan on pasting smaller shapes onto the table, cut smaller images out of scrapbooking paper. You can also use printed images, fabric, cards, magazines, etc.  Apply it only to where you will be putting the paper. This could be the entire tabletop or just patches (if you are using smaller images).Be generous with the decoupage glue. You want it to be nice and thick.  Flip the paper over so that the back is facing you. Coat the back of the paper with decoupage glue using a foam brush., Don't press it down just yet. Make sure that it is places exactly where you want it to be. If the placement is off, carefully nudge it back into place.  Work your way from the middle of the table to the outer edges. You can smooth the paper down with a credit card, a ruler, or even a clean, foam roller.Some stores also sell special smoothing tools just for decoupage.   If you see air bubbles, pop them with a pin or needle, then smooth them down.If your paper has overhanging edges, do not press them onto the sides of the table. Leave them hanging loose.  Let the paper dry for 30 minutes first. Next, apply a coat of decoupage glue using a foam brush. Apply the glue starting from the center of the paper and work your way outward towards the edges., You only need to do this if you covered the entire tabletop with paper. Run the block back and forth across the top edge of the table. This will saw off the excess paper. Discard any paper that falls off.Wipe off any dust.  Use the same technique as before: apply the glue with a foam sponge, working your way from center-out. Let the glue dry completely before moving on., You do not have to do all of the ideas suggested in this part. Simply choose one or two that appeal the most to you, and run wild with them!  , Choose shapes that work with your tabletop's color and/or design. Cut them out along the outline with a sharp pair of scissors. Apply decoupage to the back, then place them onto the table. Smooth them down from center-out with a credit card.   You can do this step too, even if you already added cut-out shapes onto your bare or painted table. Consider layering the shapes to create unique images.  Lay down a stencil onto you table. Apply acrylic paint over the stencil with a round, foam brush (pouncer). Dab the brush up and down over the stencil. Do not drag the brush across the stencil, or you will risk getting paint under it. Pull the stencil away when you are done, before the paint dries.Use colors that contrast with your design to make them stand out, such as white, black, silver, or gold.  This method will work similar to stenciling and is great for a rustic design. Pour out some acrylic paint onto a plate, lid, or other pallet. Dip the stamp into the paint, then press it lightly against the table. Lift it away to reveal your stamped design. Repeat this step as often as you'd like.   Use a color that contrasts with your design. White, black, silver, or gold are great, neutral colors that will help the stamp stand out.  If you have elegant handwriting, you could write passages from your favorite books, songs, or poems onto the table using a thin brush; cursive or calligraphy would work well here. If you are very artistic, you can even paint your own sketches onto to the table instead; birds and flowers make great motif.   Keep the designs and colors simple. Black is a great choice.  This works great with cut-out images. Use gold or silver ink (or a thin brush and acrylic paint) to highlight certain features on your cut-outs. For example, if you used roses, you can add highlights to the tips of some of the petals. Keep it simple however; less is more!   Glittery paint may also work, depending on your design.  You only need to do this if you layered on more paper, paint, or designs. Let everything dry first, then apply the decoupage glue with a foam brush. Work your way from center-out, then let it dry completely.  Choose a waterproof, acrylic topcoat. Spray it onto the table. If you need to apply a second coat, wait until the first one dries. You can also use a polyurethane topcoat, but be aware that it may yellow over time.Topcoats come in many different finishes, such as glossy, satin, and matte. Choose one that works the best for you. You can also use a brush-on topcoat if you prefer.  Just because something feels dries does not mean that it is ready to be used. Read the can of your topcoat, and see what the complete drying and curing times are. In most cases, this will be about 24 hours. If you use the table too soon, the topcoat may get tacky. 

choose a wooden table that you not mind ruining.  sand the table, if needed.  wipe the table down with a damp cloth.  paint the table, if desired.  gather and prepare your paper.  apply decoupage glue to the table with a sponge brush.  apply more decoupage glue to the back of the paper.  place the paper on top of the table.  smooth the paper down.  let the paper dry before applying another layer of glue.  sand the edges of the table with a fine-grit sanding block, if needed.  apply a second coat of decoupage glue.  consider adding additional designs.  add cut-out shapes onto your tabletop.  stencil designs onto the tabletop.  stamp designs onto the tabletop.  consider adding free-hand designs with a thin brush.  add highlights or accents to existing images.  paint another coat of decoupage glue, if needed.  apply a spray-on topcoat.  let the topcoat cure before using the table. 

 Decide how you want to keep your journal, either on paper or in electronic form. Both methods have advantages and drawbacks, so you'll need to weigh up what works best for you. For example, a paper based journal can be taken anywhere, never needs electricity, and can be highly personalized with drawings, collages, theater-tickets and mementos. It also can give you more "pressure" to edit your feelings. However, typing can be faster and easier in the electronic format, and an electronic document can still be personalized in different ways. Both journal types can be found if measures aren't taken to hide them well, but it's probably easier to hide an electronic file than a paper book.   While there is no need to get a fancy journal, for some people the stationery used is a large part of the sensory experience of keeping a journal. You don't have to buy expensive or fancy versions but if they are something you really want and they're a treat to yourself, then work it into your budget. Decorating possibilities are endless for cheaper journals and it's fun to personalize a journal rather than rely on someone else's idea of good design. Just keep in mind that it's not about using a fancy book; it's about tapping into the stream of thoughts and writing them down. Decide on your writing implement if using paper. Choose a pen that feels good to you and works for your own aesthetic needs.  There are different possibilities open to you when developing your journal theme or approach. You could simply use your journal to write down all the thoughts that come to you at any particular time, randomly, or you could make your journal more focused on a specific theme to draw out something that you're trying to develop more of in your life. And there is nothing saying that you can't keep both a random and a specific journal at the same time! Some ideas for themed journals include:   A gratitude journal – in this journal you record all the things for which you feel grateful each day, week, etc. and note the people, animals, events, and things that really matter to you. A vacation journal – in this journal you record more than just what you see on your vacation; you also record your feelings, impressions, and emotions as they are challenged, changed, and illuminated by your travels. An ideas journal – in this journal you record all the ideas and inspirations that flash into your mind at any time without warning, providing a place that you can come back to as an idea-storming resource when you have the time. The ideas can be for writing, for business, for play, for inventions, for anything at all! A child raising journal – in this journal you record all the things that you think are special, wonderful, lovable, and memorable about your kids at different ages and stages. This is a great way to keep a record of those funny words, phrases, and comments made by kids as they grow up and see the world anew. A transition journal – in this journal you record the transition you're going through, such as job hunting or loss, becoming a parent for the first time or again after many years, starting a business, going on a special journey, etc. This type of journal can document changing patterns in your life, and it is useful to ask yourself such questions as "What do I enjoy and not enjoy?", "What do I expect for the future in what I am doing now?", "Which people can help me as I transition?", etc.  Journal writing is a time of reflection and requires solitude, peace, and no interruptions. It's important to feel relaxed, at ease, and not worried about someone else barging in on your reflection time. It's also important to feel comfortable. Select your favorite journal writing spot or spots keeping in mind all of these essential needs and experiment by writing in different places to see what happens to the content of your writing.   Take a seat in your chair by the glowing fire or lie down underneath a blossoming apple tree. Find a quiet part of the house where you know you won't be disturbed. The suitability of a place can change with the time of day. Keep this in mind when selecting your writing nook; for example, the kitchen might be hubbub and bustle all day long but come 10pm, it might be the quietest and most enjoyable part of the house.  Some of the advice on journal-writing tries to turn it into an effort by suggesting that you should commit to daily writing, or to some form of regular writing. This misses the point in keeping a journal, which is that it is an extension of you and how you're feeling. And if you don't feel like writing in your journal even though you made some commitment to yourself to write in it, it's possibly going to turn into something that you resent. Better than making a commitment to regular writing is to make a commitment to yourself that when you feel like using your journal to be creative, to vent feelings, to write down ideas, etc., then you will. And if that's daily, then good for you; if it skips a month or two or even a year here and there, then so be it. Many journal writers have journals spanning years with gaps of entire years between and pick them up again from where they last left off whenever they need the journal.   Keeping your journal by your bedside can be helpful if you find yourself forgetting to write in it. Often thoughts come before sleeping time and writing in a journal can be a helpful way to wind down at the day's end, provided it's a comfortable place for you. Remind yourself whenever you feel down, antsy, brimful of ideas, etc., that your journal is the perfect outlet.  Every person differs in what helps them to relax and feel contented, and it is no different when getting in the mood for journal writing. Some people enjoy having music to get them in the mood, others need total quiet, while others need the constant drone of city life to stimulate thinking. Choose whatever methods aid your escape into journal writing and doesn't make it feel like too much effort.   Don't fuss about grammar, spelling, or other perfection in your journal. This is your place, and if there are boo boos, then so be it. Wanting to erase errors while working through deep issues of feelings or having a wellspring of ideas can hamper your flow and also tends to suggest that you're trying too hard to control the situation you're writing about rather than to learn more about it and to find new ways to perceive it.  It's often easiest to start with your current feelings. Transfer them to paper and see where this takes you next. There are no rules at all about journal writing and you may find that your starting points vary every time you begin a new entry. Sometimes it is easier to begin with a narrative about something that happened to you during the day, something that is burning right through you and that you want answers to but feel confused about. Writing down the mundane facts and events can open up a whole stream of consciousness as you're writing, leading you to insights you would not have been able to bring forth without arranging your thoughts in the journal. Other spurs to writing can include:   Try movies, books, or TV shows as a starting point sometimes: for example, you can consider the philosophical implications of your favorite movie, or write an essay about why you find this or that character compelling... or not. Pretend you have an audience and you are the professor; give a lecture in what you want them to hear. Sometimes writing down events in your life that have taken place or writing down questions and answering them can waken the creative juices simmering in your mind. Discuss something you bought or made during the past few days. Is it something that you're going to use for a new hobby, to help you complete an essay, to woo a person with, to decorate your home, etc.? Take the reason for buying or making it and proceed to write about the motivations behind it.  Journals come top of the list when venting your troubles; many therapists rubber-stamp the journal as a key part of recovery from emotional distresses that patients are seeking to work through. A journal soaks up your anger, your rage, your vengeance, your jealousy, your whole plethora of negative emotions and doesn't judge you, doesn't shout back at you, doesn't curse you, and doesn't tell you to get a life. It sits there passive in one way but very revealing in another. Getting negative feelings off your chest and into a journal can liberate you from having to vent the feelings anywhere else, and can give you the necessary breathing space to try to see the facts beneath the emotions and to stand in the shoes of others involved in your feelings to see whether or not they have a point.   Feel free to curse, to call people names, and to let it all out. It's better here than anywhere else and it is a way of giving vent to frustration, anger, and attitude that needs an outlet somewhere safe. Keep writing until you feel spent. This gives you the best chance of freeing yourself from the feelings that are haunting you and preventing you from moving on to more positive feelings. Write about the guy you never think you'll get to date, write about the girl next door who keeps telling secrets about you, write about your parents or parents-in-law, or your family in general, write about your ambitions, your callings, your skills, your favorites; the list can go on and on.  Of course, doodles are totally acceptable. Lyrics to songs, poems, book excerpts and newspaper clippings are also encouraged. It's sometimes fun to glue in little tidbits of your life, like the ticket stubs from a movie or play you saw on Friday night or the picture you took of a breathtaking sunset. The journal is the real-life manifestation of your mind, so make it something that's completely yours!  , It's not all write and no read; comparing where you are now with where your were several weeks, months, and years ago is a beneficial exercise in growth. Think about what things have become clearer to you from one journal entry to the next, and think about what hopes and dreams once written in your journal have now turned into reality. Think about the things that are yet to still happen and whether there are signs or patterns you can discern that are somehow blocking your intended progress. Use your journal to assess your life's journey.  No one will see this journal but you have to make sure of that too. You'll only feel free to truly express yourself if the journal cannot compromise your relationships with others or how you're viewed, so be sure to find safe places to keep the journal.   Find perfect hiding places for your journal. Vary them regularly if you have concerns about anybody prying. Be clever about the cover too; perhaps make it appear like a chemistry textbook or accounting principles to throw off snooping siblings or spouses. Learn how to lock access to electronic documents. If you're keeping your journal in electronic form, password protect your computer and your document. Be careful of cloud computing just in case some slip-up happens. Write a simple beginning note for any prying eyes, just in case. Write something along the lines of "Before you feel compelled to read my deepest thoughts, consider how you would feel if somebody did the same thoughtless and uncaring act to you. The karma be with you." Read How to hide your diary for some more ideas.  

find a journal medium that's perfect for you.  decide what kind of journal you'd like to keep.  find the perfect place (or places) for writing in your journal.  find a time that's right for you.  relax.  find sources of inspiration.  use a journal to work through the hard stuff.  fill your journal with whatever you like.  reflect over what you've written now and then.  keep your journal safe. 

 Unless you know your floors are unwaxed, you'll need to test for wax in order to know how to best care for your flooring. Dampen a piece of extra fine steel wool and use it to rub areas you think might be waxed.Wax will show up as a light grey smudge or smear on the steel wool. Floors that date prior to 1930 typically have many layers of paste wax over a tung oil finish or shellac. You can screen and re-wax the floor or use a chemical stripper to remove the wax and apply a modern polyurethane finish.  The easiest and gentlest way to restore an old floor to its former glory is to screen it with a buffer. After cleaning the floor, use a handheld sanding screen to roughen up the edges and corners of the room where the buffer can't access. Use a buffer with a 150- or 120-grit sanding disc to screen the floor, or buff down the existing finish.The sanding discs will wear out, so you'll need at least three to screen a typical room.  Once you've finished buffing, wipe down windowsills and other surfaces and vacuum the room thoroughly to remove all dust.Your choice of finish will depend on the results of your wax test.   For waxed floors, apply paste wax. If your floor was finished with a modern sealer, go with polyurethane. You can't use one if you started with the other: don't apply wax to a polyurethane finish or vice versa., If your floor is more than 50 years old, you should avoid sanding it. There's a limit to how much wood you can remove without permanently damaging the floor. When cleaning and reviving an old hardwood floor, sand only if it's so heavily stained that screening or chemical stripping aren't options., Get professional help if your old hardwood flooring is seriously worn or damaged, or if you're unsure about its composition. Word of mouth is typically the best way to find a good contractor. Look for one with restoration experience who won't advise you to simply rip out the entire floor unless absolutely necessary.For example, if your floor needs patching, you could have an experienced contractor remove flooring from a hidden spot, like a closet, and use it to replace a worn or damaged area.  

test for wax.  screen your floor with a buffer.  refinish your floor.  avoid sanding old hardwood floors unless absolutely necessary.  consult a professional with restoration experience. 

 One way to prevent tendonitis is to warm up before you exercise. Try light exercises and massage your joints and muscles before you get to the main part of your workout. Slowly build up to a higher intensity. If you jump right into the hard part, you're more likely to get tendonitis.When you're warming up, the idea is to warm up the muscles you'll be using in the exercise. Often that can just mean doing the exercise at a slower pace for five or ten minutes. For example, you could walk at a slow pace before a faster walk, jog, or run. For swimming, you could swim at a slower pace before going faster.; , If you're always doing the same type of exercise, you're more likely to develop tendonitis. That's why it's sometimes referred to as "tennis elbow," "swimmer's shoulder," "pitcher's shoulder," and so on. It's doing the same repetitive movement that's the problem. If you're having problems with one exercise, do another for a little while instead.For instance, if you've been playing tennis and have developed tennis elbow, try running or jogging for a while instead. If you've been running and have developed tendonitis in your feet or knees, try something with less impact, such as swimming. You can also modify an exercise to put less stress on certain parts of your body. For instance, if your ankles hurt while doing pushups, try doing them on your knees instead.  That is, find out the proper way to do each exercise and use each type of equipment when you're exercising. Use good form when you exercise. If you are exercising improperly, you're more likely to develop injuries like tendonitis.If you're at the gym and you're unsure how to use a piece of equipment, ask someone who works there. If you're wanting to learn an exercise at home, use high quality training websites and videos to figure out how to do an exercise properly.  Once you're done working out, don't just stop the exercise. It's time to cool down.Cooling down is basically the same as warming up. That is, you want to use the same muscles you've been using, just lowering the intensity of the exercise.If you've been running, walk for five to ten minutes. If you've been swimming at a high intensity, slow down for the last few laps. Stretching all of your major muscles and taking all of your major joints through the full range of motion at the end of your workout will help to prevent tendonitis.  If you develop a pain while exercising, you should stop that exercise for a while. It's particularly important to stop the exercise if the pain comes on suddenly, but you should also take a break from the exercise if the pain comes on gradually.If you do develop pain, see a doctor.  After cooling down, take time to stretch out your muscles before finishing up your workout. Stretching increases your flexibility and range of motion, and you do it at the end because your muscles are warmed up enough that you aren't as likely to be injured in the process. You can also do stretching after the warm-up if you prefer., Lay on your back with your body flat. Pull one knee up towards you, wrapping your hands around the back of your leg as it comes up. Pull it straight up in the air so that it's perpendicular to your body. Return it to the floor. Do five reps, and then switch to the other side.You can also increase flexibility by adding reps at different angles. Try turning your thigh inward for five reps and then outward for five reps.  Roll over on your stomach. With your toes pointed, lift your body off the ground by pushing your arms out until they are completely straight, which is how it differs from a pushup. Your thighs should be off the ground, too, and your back should be curved backwards. Tilt your chin up, and hold this position for five to ten seconds before releasing., Face a wall, starting a little less than a foot away. Put your hands on the wall. Move one leg backwards, and bend the knee of the other leg. The heel of the back leg should stay on the ground. Hold for a few seconds, and then change legs., Begin with your feet at shoulder-width. Step one foot forward about a foot. Interlock your fingers, and place your hands under your ribs. At the same time, try to pull your shoulders down. Lower your whole body by bending your knees. Go down as you count to three and lift back up as you count to three. Try five reps on each side., Lift one arm above your head with the elbow bent. Use the other arm to grab the elbow and gently pull it in that direction. Hold the stretch for a few seconds, and switch arms. Don't bend the arm too far., Yoga is a great way to increase your overall mobility, as it is basically just an intense form of stretching and moving.It will help increase your flexibility, too, decreasing your chances of injury, as tendonitis often results from having tight tissues.To prevent yoga injuries make sure you start your practice under the guidance of a qualified yoga instructor. Consider joining a local yoga class. You can find them through your parks and recreation department or at local yoga studios.  It's not good to jump into the highest level of a sport without building up your body first. Any time you want to start a new sport or intense exercise, it's best to start small and build up slowly over time.So you've decided you want to run a marathon. That's great. However, what you shouldn't do is try to run 10 miles tomorrow when you've been sitting on the couch for months. Start by working the muscles you need to run before you even starting running, then slowly increase how much you run day by day. The same holds true for any sport. Work to build the muscles you need before you start the sport.  Strength training should be an integral part of your week. Strengthening your muscles can help reduce the strain on your tendons. Work specifically on the muscles you use in your exercises and at your work.To build muscle, you can do things like use weights, use resistance machines, or do body weight exercises like lunges, squats, and push-ups. When playing a particular sport, focus on exercises that will develop the muscles you need to use for that sport.  You can develop tendonitis at work as easily as you can at the gym, particularly if you're doing the same thing over and over again. If you've been having pain, adjust your work space to better meet your needs. You may need to adjust the height of your chair or keyboard, for instance.A professional can help with this task. You can hire someone to do an ergonomic assessment of your work space to help you figure out what needs to be adjusted.

 Before folding the letter, make sure that the address on the inside of the letter matches with the one that you have written or printed on the envelope.This will help avoid any mixups. Don’t forget to check that you’ve signed the letter.  Make sure that the text is facing up and towards you. This is your last chance to proofread and double check that you haven’t forgotten anything.For example, have you dated the letter? Are there any spelling or grammar mistakes?  , Take the bottom of the letter and fold it so that it is about half an inch (about 1 cm) from the top of the page.You can place the envelope underneath the letter to use as a guide. Make sure that when you have folded the letter up, it is small enough to fit inside the envelope.  Make sure to line up all the outside edges of the paper before creasing so that you don’t end up with a crooked fold. If the fold is crooked, your letter may not fit into the envelope.Use a ruler to make the crease nice and sharp. You can do this by holding a ruler sideways and using the thin edge. Slide the edge of the ruler along the letter on the creases so they are nice and flat.  You will now take the right part of the letter and fold it about one third of the way in.Line up the top and bottom edges of the letter and then crease the fold.  Take the other side of the letter and fold it one third of the way in. This will be the same thing that you did with the right side.Line up the top and bottom of the edges so they are perfectly straight before creasing.  The last crease you made should go into the bottom of the envelope first. Place it so that the folds face the backside of the envelope.This will make it easy for your recipient to find where to begin unfolding the letter.  

check the address.  lay the letter on a table.  fold the bottom half up.  crease the fold.  fold the right half of the letter inwards.  fold the left half of the letter inwards.  turn the letter sideways and insert into the envelope. 

 Both parties must have an understanding of the specific work to be done, and how it will fit in with the contractor's existing schedule and deadlines.   Both parties also should have a clear understanding of what the subcontractor is capable of doing, particularly within whatever time constraints are presented by the project.; , The general contractor and subcontractor need to work together to come up with a realistic expectation of how long it will take to finish the job, taking into consideration any excusable delays such as rain that might slow completion.   As the general contractor, you should make sure that the subcontractor's deadlines are well before your deadlines laid out in your master contract. That way you can be sure that if anything happens, or if the subcontractor doesn't do the job according to specifications, you have time to correct the problem., If the subcontractor needs separate materials to complete her part of the project, she and the general contractor must decide whether she or the general contractor are responsible for purchasing those materials.   Often the subcontractor will be responsible for providing her own materials, but in some cases particular materials may have already been purchased to conform to the wishes of the property owner., Agree upon the total amount the general contractor will pay the subcontractor, then decide when and how it will be paid.  If the general contractor plans to pass on to the subcontractor any costs or penalties included in his contract, this should be discussed.   As a subcontractor, you shouldn't agree to a general contractor's form agreement without discussing or negotiating the provisions. Keep in mind that the standard form agreement a general contractor uses was drawn up to his benefit. If you feel uncomfortable or pressured, have an attorney or even another contractor look over the agreement and provide their opinion on whether it's fair.Decide what to do if changes to the work or schedule for the project must be made. Both parties should agree on what changes will be allowed within the scope of the agreement, how much notice should be provided of changes, and when the subcontractor is entitled to an extension of time for changes to the work., Open the agreement by providing the individual names of the two people signing the agreement, as well as business names if applicable. Include contact information such as addresses and phone numbers for both the general contractor and the subcontractor.   Include the legal status of all parties. For example, if the general contractor is an LLC, but the subcontractor is a sole proprietor, these business entities should be identified in the contract. How each party is organized to do business potentially alters their liability under the contract.The initial part of the contract also should mention the project the subcontractor is being hired to work on and reference the master or prime contract.In this section you also may want to define the relationship of the parties and clarify that the subcontractor is an independent contractor and not an employee of the general contractor.If the subcontractor will be bringing in other workers to help complete her portion of the work under the contract, include a statement that they are her employees, not employees of the general contractor., Provide a description of exactly what the subcontractor is expected to do for the general contractor.   You want these descriptions to be as specific as possible, because these clauses put the subcontractor on notice as to the contractor's expectations. Try to cover as many contingencies as you can think of. If the property owner doesn't like the subcontractor's work, the contract should make it clear under what circumstances the subcontractor is expected to come back and fix it to the owner's expectations.For example, if the subcontractor completes the kitchen cabinets and countertops to the property owner's specifications, but the property owner later decides he wants marble countertops, the contract should state whether it is the subcontractor's responsibility to come back and remove the countertops he installed, or to install the new marble ones, and whether he gets any additional payment for this work.  If you've agreed that specific parties will be responsible for inspections or for completion of any prerequisites, those should be included in the contract.   For example, you might want to make it clear in the contract that the subcontractor is providing her own worker's compensation insurance and liability insurance that meets the legal requirements in your state.As a general contractor, you should consider including a clause that preserves your right to inspect the subcontractor's work at any time and ensure it conforms with the specifications both of the subcontractor agreement and your master contract., Place the subcontractor's work into the context of the general contractor's overall schedule and provide deadlines for each phase of work to be completed.   Specify the rate of pay in the contract and create milestones for payment. For example, if you are going to pay the subcontractor $2,000 to paint the house you're building, you might pay $500 for every 25 percent of the house that's painted.Rather than specific milestones, you may pay the subcontractor a set amount each week, or make weekly payments provided a certain number of hours are worked or a certain amount of work is completed.Typically you will list the total payment amount, and then provide the schedule of payments to be made throughout the project as percentages of that total.Consider including a clause making time of the essence, and penalizing the subcontractor for any delays caused by the subcontractor's failure to adhere to the schedule required by the general contractor., The subcontractor typically warrants her work against defects in material or craftsmanship for a number of years, and holds the general contractor harmless from claims or losses connected to the work she performs.Typically the subcontractor will warrant that she will provide quality work in a professional manner, that she and her employees have the level of skill and experience required to complete the task, and that all of her work will conform to the overall project specifications.Indemnification clauses shouldn't be one sided. If the subcontractor indemnifies the general contractor against claims or losses from her work, the general contractor should likewise indemnify the subcontractor.Although it is typical for a subcontractor to assume any damages or penalties related to her work specifically, she should be on the lookout for any "pass-through" clause in which the general contractor seeks to pass on the liability for all of the general contractor's requirements or obligations under the master contract.Likewise, subcontractors should avoid signing broad indemnity clauses that impose liability on them for all claims and damages, even those caused by the general contractor's own negligence., Typically, the subcontractor agreement can be terminated by the general contractor for the same reasons the owner can terminate the master or prime contract.   If such a clause is used, the master contract should be attached as an exhibit to the subcontractor's contract and incorporated by reference.Include the effective dates of the contract, along with a final date for completion of the project., Nearly every contract includes clauses known as "boilerplate provisions," which cover issues such as what state's law governs the contract and where a lawsuit for breach of contract can be filed.   These clauses are referred to as "miscellaneous" or "boilerplate" because they apply to nearly any contract regardless of the substance. For example, the agreement may include a clause that the parties agree to submit to mediation or binding arbitration in the event of a contract breach or dispute., Both the subcontractor and the general contractor must sign the agreement for it to be legally binding and enforceable. 

determine the scope of the work the subcontractor will do.  estimate time for completion of the work.  decide who will provide materials and when they will be delivered.  discuss payment methods and terms.  consider what should happen in the event of a breach of contract.  identify the parties.  define the scope of work to be done.  list the rights and duties of each party.  create work completion and payment schedules.  provide warranty and indemnity clauses.  provide methods by which the contract can be terminated.  include any necessary miscellaneous provisions.  sign your agreement. 

 Type the following command at the command prompt: vi FunLoop.sh. This will create the file you are going to use as a script file and open it for editing.; , Every shell script needs this to tell it what shell to run in. Type #!/bin/bash.  You will need one to capture the choice entered by the user and one to set the directory based on the user's choice. Type directory="" and choice=0.  It is a straightforward code and it has a name that is case sensitive. Name it menuList. Everything between the opening and closing brackets is any code you wish it to be.  It should look like: menuList(). , It should look like this: clear.       echo "1. Run ls on my home directory." echo "2. Run ls on the root directory." echo "3. Run ls on the bin directory." echo "4. Exit program."     ,,, You should add runLS(). , ls -la $directory where $directory is the one specified by the menu choice. ,, while . Where $choice is the input from the user and 4 is the menu item to tell the program to close, -ne is a conditional operator used in bash shell scripting for number evaluation.  Type in do.  You have four menu items so you will need four if statements and a catch all for values that don't meet the menu items' requirements. Write the if statement as follows:      if then $directory="~/" runLS elif then $directory="/" runLS elif then $directory="/bin" runLS elif then clear echo "Thank you for using list files" sleep 3 exit else echo "Invalid choice, please try again" fi done     ,, Type in: chmod u+x FunLoop.sh.

 You might try to look at lists of baby names online. Another suggestion is to name is after your favorite fictional character. Maybe try a name starting with A to carry on the tradition from Arnold, Ginny's puff.  Pygmy Puffs, like Puffskeins, will eat almost anything. So do not let your pet go anywhere near your wand... or your phone. Maybe just some crackers and water.  You might not want your Pygmy Puff to feel alone and abandoned because it will probably eat your things. You should spend time playing with your Pygmy Puff. They are nearly indestructible so you don't have to be as careful with it as you would another animal such as a rat or an owl.  A shoebox is an ideal box.; ,, If you don't have a small blanket, use a piece of fleece fabric cut into a rectangle or square shape.  Make sure it's nice and soft. , Every night read your Puff a story. Make sure you don't read violent stories, otherwise your puff might have nightmares.  

name your pygmy puff.  feed the pygmy puff.  play with the pygmy puff.  find a medium sized cardboard box, a blanket, and a marker.write the puff's name on the box  ,  fold up the blanket so that if fits inside the box.  place the blanket in box.  decorate the bed box however you and your pet want it to look.  ,  tuck the pygmy puff in each night. 

 A confession should ideally be a private, intimate conversation between you and whoever you've affected with your actions. Don't invite more people than you need to - a confession should be a humbling affair, not a chance for you to perform for an audience. Organize a small, in-person get-together with the person(s) you've done wrong to. You can be as direct as you like in your invitation. There's nothing wrong with simply saying, "I have a confession to make. When can we meet?" Try not to make a joke about this, laughing maybe taken as an offense and will ruin the confession   Give yourself some privacy. Confessions can, unfortunately, cause emotions to flare. Don't open yourself or your confessor up to embarrassment by, for example, confessing in a crowded restaurant.; , For much of our lives, we project certain facades and cultivate certain self-images that reflect how we want to be seen by other people. A confession is no time to worry about these things. Realize that a sincere confession reveals the inner "you." You can't make a good confession from a false position of superiority. You're acknowledging your own imperfection, which, for many people, is an especially difficult, intimate task. Any attempts to remain "cool" or aloof will make you seem insincere. Be ready to shed any pretenses that you normally maintain.   Here's an example of a confession that sounds disingenuous: "Hey, Frank, I broke your trumpet. Sorry! Guess I don't know my own strength!" This confession doesn't seem to come from a place of sincere regret - by trying to keep the mood light, the speaker sacrifices the integrity of his confession. A better approach would be something like: "Hey, Frank. Listen, I have some bad news. I accidentally broke your trumpet. I'm so sorry. I know how important it was to you. " We don't only maintain facades when we deal with other people. We also routinely lie to ourselves about our true motivations. Be completely open and honest with your internal thoughts - why did you do the bad things you did? Don't make any excuses for yourself if you don't have any.  This is the central purpose of your confession - to reveal that you've done wrong. Be direct and to the point. Tell the people you have gathered with that you've made a mistake that's hurt them. Tell them that you feel bad about what you've done and that you want forgiveness. Calmly and clearly explain what you did, how you've hurt them, and why you're sorry.   Don't beat around the bush. If you're confessing for saying nasty about a friend behind his or her back, don't try to ease into the subject by, for instance, talking about how catty the characters in the movie Mean Girls are. It's much better to just say, "I was mad that you didn't invite me to go camping, so I told Jen that you hate her. I'm really, really sorry. It was seriously petty of me to ruin your friendship." Be prepared to weather the anger or grief of the people you've wronged. If you've seriously hurt someone, don't be surprised if they react to your confession by getting angry, crying, or shouting. The emotions surrounding a confession can be very painful. Know that, no matter how bad things get during a confession, by coming clean you're making things better in the long run than if you had allowed this person to continue without knowing the truth about things.  "Confession" implies that the knowledge of your wrongdoing is a secret. So, when you make a confession, you may also need to explain the true course of events surrounding your wrongdoing, especially if you've previously lied about what's happened. This is extremely important if someone else has taken the blame for your mistake or misdeed. You owe it to everyone involved to make sure they know the truth, even if the truth is painful.   For instance, if you sat in silence as a classmate took the blame for the senior prank that you planned, when you confess to the principal, to exonerate the innocent party (your classmate) and to ensure that the guilty party (you) receive justice, you'll need to correct the "official" version of events.  By confessing to someone, we lower ourselves before them. A confession is no time to be stubborn or prideful. Don't try to paint your actions as somehow noble or well-intended if they weren't. Don't excuse yourself if you don't deserve it. Don't use a confession as an opportunity to subtly build yourself up or put the person you've wronged down. Acknowledge your wrongdoing with humble dignity.   Never blame your victim while you're confessing. If you've "borrowed" a little money out of someone's purse, don't say something like "I'm sorry I took your money, but I only did it because you wouldn't buy me those shoes I liked."  , Be humble and direct. A line like "I'm really, really sorry. I hope you can forgive me" works fine. This should be what you want out of a confession - to get the assurance that you're forgiven in the heart of the person(s) you've hurt. This gives you a sense of closure and internal peace. It also allows you to begin to move on because when you're forgiven you know that you're "done" with the confession process. After you're forgiven, any additional guilt will have no purpose, so try to move on.   Unfortunately, in some cases, the people you've wronged might not forgive you. If you've hurt someone multiple times or you've done something especially egregious, they're justified in withholding their forgiveness. In this case, it's not enough to say you're sorry - show them that you're truly repentant by changing your behavior.  You've confessed and (hopefully) been forgiven. How do you move forward? A good first step is to ask for advice on to what to do next. For instance, the person you hurt might give you instructions on how to make things up to them. They might also tell you who else you need to confess to. They might even tell you how your personal relationship has changed. If you've done something serious, your relationship with the people you've hurt may be subject to new rules or boundaries. For instance, if you've used your access to someone's sensitive information to spread gossip, you may no longer be trusted with secrets. Honor these new boundaries to show you're truly sorry and to speed your journey back to normal levels of trust.   Remember that confession doesn't "wipe the slate clean." Don't return to your old bad behavior. A confession should be used not just for forgiveness, but also for growth, so be sure to move forward, away from your bad deeds, not backward.  If you've done something wrong with serious consequences, like if you've committed a crime, you should make your initial confession to a law enforcement representative or another appropriate authority. Cooperating fully with the authorities also serves a practical purpose - it can be used to reduce the length or severity of your punishment.   Never try to lie to a judge or police officer to avoid a confession. This is a crime. By making these lies, you make your eventual punishment even worse.  It can be very, very hard to confess to someone you're romantically involved with. No one wants to hurt or disappoint the people they love. Unfortunately, by not confessing, you are hurting your S.O. They just don't know they're being hurt. Confessions within the context of a romantic relationship can be very difficult and painful, so, if you're hesitating, motivate yourself to start the confession process by thinking of your confession as an act of love. You're showing that you love your partner by telling them the truth, even if the truth damages their opinion of you.   This being said, don't twist your love for your partner into an excuse for your actions. "I kept this information from you because I love you" isn't a justification for your behavior. If you haven't been honest to your partner, you've hurt them. Period.  In a relationship, it's even more important than normal that your partner knows exactly how you've hurt them. Because you (presumably) still care about your partner, it can be tempting to avoid hurting his or her feelings by lying about what you've done to make your wrongdoing seem less serious than it is or somehow well-intentioned. Don't do this. Your partner deserves to know the truth, even if it's a painful truth. This will also open your relationship up to future heartbreak, should your lie be discovered. Be honest and tell the whole story of your wrongdoing.   While it's very important to be forthcoming about what you've done, it's possible to cause unnecessary pain by giving too much detail in your confession. If, for instance, you've committed an act of infidelity, you should be honest about who was involved and when the event occurred, but you shouldn't go into a detailed play-by-play of the day's events unless you're asked to - this information can be very painful for your partner to hear. Think of a romantic confession as a particularly difficult way of updating your partner on the state of your relationship. You can't have a healthy relationship that's open to growth if both partners have different ideas about what's happening in the relationship.  There's a reason that we say that "trust is the foundation of a relationship." A relationship without some degree of trust isn't possible. We can't spy on our partners 24/7, so we trust them to be honest about what they've done and what they've said. We also trust our partners to be open about the way that they feel. If you've been concealing your actions or feelings from your partner, you've damaged their ability to trust you. A sincere apology may, in time, help you regain that trust.  In addition to apologizing for violating your partner's trust, you should also devote a little time to apologizing for the fact that you've reduced the happiness, openness, and overall health of the relationship you share. You have, in a sense, damaged something that you both own. Making a confession to your partner is like coming clean about ruining a project you both worked on together, but with very high emotional stakes.   The time after a confession can be tense and awkward for both partners. It can even, depending on the severity of your wrongdoing, be marked by real sadness. When you apologize for damaging your relationship, it can be wise to apologize for the hard times your confession will cause in the near future.  Confessing to wrongdoing is always a healthier, more honest thing to do that keeping your actions a secret. However, a confession can change a relationship. It may change the way your partner and you think about each other. It may change the the amount that you trust each other. In serious cases, your relationship may even be damaged beyond repair. Accept these changes to your relationship. Confessions open up the path of healing and allow you to start working past your mistakes, but they don't absolve you of the consequences of your actions.   Let's hypothetically say that you make a sincere confession to your partner about an act of infidelity you've committed. Suppose your partner says that s/he would like to "take a break" from your relationship. Even if this is very difficult for you, you need to humbly honor your partner's wish. After all, the relationship is as much your partner's as it is yours. If one partner wants to end a relationship or make a serious change to it, the other partner has no right to force him or her not to.  

sit down with the person (or people) you've wronged.  prepare to be completely earnest and genuine.  make an admission of guilt.  correct any false information or misconceptions.  be humble.  ask for forgiveness.  ask for advice.  notify the appropriate authorities for serious confessions.  frame your confession as an act of love.  explain what you've done.  apologize for violating your partner's trust.  apologize for damaging your relationship.  accept the consequences of your actions. 

 On vacation or holiday, an amateur photographer takes photos that capture special moments or exotic locales. These photos are wonderful images for the family albums, but in order to sell photos online or in other venues, the photos must be excellent quality and saleable to the publishers, designers and editors who buy photos.   Research the types of photos that are currently selling online. With the results of this research in mind, review existing photos and plan trips to capture images that are currently in demand.      ; , A photographer who is computer savvy will find programs or instructions to create a website that will display the available photos and the tools to collect fees from the buyers. Photographers who are not confident enough to create their own presence on the web can hire experts to create a website.  Follow the procedures for submitting photos to these agencies and present your photos to the selection boards. Established agencies are recognized by the individuals currently buying photographs so your photos will find an excellent showcase if accepted by a stock agency. The stock agency acts as an intermediary for photographers. The personnel at the agency work with the customers so the photographers concentrate on the business of acquiring new photos.   Take new photos to meet the standards of the stock photo agencies if your first submissions are rejected.       Rely on the stock agency to negotiate the rights that each photographer sells to customers. The expertise of staff at the stock agencies will facilitate the appropriate placement of photos with the buyers. Photographers do not want to relinquish rights to their photos without obtaining proper compensation for the right to use or publish their photos.  These agencies accept photographs from an amateur photographer and provide a great entryway to a more sophisticated career. Although some microstock agencies charge a regular fee to participate, there are excellent microstock agencies that provide their services for free.   Start with a microstock agency to gain experience and expertise. Look for an agency that provides excellent guidance for photographers with limited skills.  Practice and experience will pay off in better photographs. Develop both the art and craft of your photographic expertise.

 If you have a great idea already, then build off of that. Have an idea before you write the song; it will make it a lot easier!; , Look up verses that resonate most with you. Can you see ways in which these will form a great basis for a song? By focusing on a Biblical passage or verse, you will improve the Christian content of the song and strengthen its value. This will keep it grounded in truth.  You can listen to the sermon your preacher gives Sundays, and write about the topic he or she put forward. Try putting lines he or she emphasizes as the most important lines in your song. He or she may even be willing to help your song by reading what you've produced and make some suggestions.  Will it tell a story? Will it illustrate a journey, or demonstrate a viewpoint?  , This will help you to connect best with the audience, by writing about how you are feeling. If you're sad write a slow, steady song. If you're happy write a more upbeat song. Every good songwriter has a mixture. And the audience will connect with that, relating it back to their own experiences.  It should be something that works for you, that you enjoy listening to and that you want to share with others. Any kind of music can be turned into a Christian song, with imagination and will.  They may be Christian-based or secular; it doesn't really matter as you'll be using them for inspiration, not copying exactly.  Having a general order in which to do things can get your brain working.  Can you create a bunch of mini-songs which can then be strung together to form the whole content of the song?  , If the verses added prevent the song from making good sense, move them around a bit. Shift in new ones and pull other ones out. Go back constantly to your theme or message decided earlier, to make sure the song is fitting well.  Sing it or play it out loud, at its most basic. Is it coming across in the way you want it to? This process can be lengthy, so don't rush it. Give it plenty of time and focus on what you want the audience to understand from your song and its message. 

get a general idea of the topic you want to write about.  visit your bible.  listen to your preacher.  consider whether you'll follow a theme or introduce a message in the song.  think about what you're personally going through right now.  consider what genre you wish to make the music.  consider which artists inspire you.  have a sequence ready.  use the verses to put the song together.  shift things around.  practice the song.  name your song based on the topic or message you've chosen.  

 Visit your local supermarket and get some 10 packs of Wrigley's gum, each pack containing 5 sticks. You may have to visit many stores to see them all. Note that some of them say "EXTRA", but are still made by Wrigley's. The only popular flavors that come in that size are:   Winterfresh Watermelon Big Red/Cinnamon DoubleMint Classic Bubble Juicy Fruit Be sure to sell sugar free gum as well.; , Some examples include:   Polar Ice Wild berry Frost Peppermint Spearmint Citrus mint  , Calculate what would be a profitable but not sky high price to sell it at. 25 cents a pack is good. You still might be able to sell a pack for 50, but people might think it’s a rip-off and repeat customers are less likely- slow and steady wins the race. Don't sell your gum at prices like 13 cents, make it multiples of 5.  Go to school the next day completely prepared. Bring lots or quarters and other coins in case the first customer pays with a dollar and only wants one pack.   No special "exceptions". If you choose to sell your gum at a quarter a pack, that's a quarter for everybody, not 25 cents for your classmates and a dime for your best friend. Be fair.  For example, Asia has some really long lasting gum that is unique to them. Bring it to another area, and people will be willing to pay a lot more for it.  People may try to steal your profit or your stock, so you should always remember to store and keep your money in discreet, safe, and secretive places and put your stock in a place that you can check all the time.  

buy your stock.  experiment with other, less known flavors.  set your prices.  start selling your gum.  experiment with foreign types of gum as you know, different countries have different popular brands.  get protection. 

 For this method, take your first reading in the morning, at least an hour or so before midday. , The shadow will shrink before midday and will grow after midday.  Use the string or object you used to measure the length of the initial shadow. When the shadow grows to exactly the same length as the string (and hence exactly the same length as your first measurement), mark the spot.  Once again, this is your east-west line, and if you stand with the first mark on your left and the second on your right, you will be facing true north.  

set up a stick as perpendicular to the level ground as possible and mark the first shadow-tip as above.  find an object or length of string, etc. exactly the same length as the shadow.  ,  continue taking measurements of the shadow's length every 10-20 minutes.  measure the shadow length as the shadow grows.  draw a line connecting the first and second marks as above. 

 After the painkillers and anesthesia wear off, your dog might try chewing or licking his stitches. This can not only damage the skin, but also cause infection. Try to deter him from doing this. You can try disciplining him if he starts to bother the stitches; it may also be necessary to put a muzzle on him.If you have to, have your dog wear a cone collar to prevent him from bothering his stitches until they are healed. Make sure to leave it on for the duration of the healing process. If you take it on and off, your dog might start rebelling when you try to place it on him.You might have to leave it on for up to two weeks. You can also get a neck brace, which makes a dog unable to turn his head. This might help if the cone collar is getting in the way.; , Once the wound starts healing, it may start to itch, which means your dog will want to scratch. If this is the case, try to deter this behavior. Sometimes, the cone collar can help. If it doesn’t, then cover the stitches with gauze or bandages. Keep supervising your dog to make sure she’s not scratching them.You can also put booties or wraps on her paws and claws to keep the wound from getting hurt. Scratching can rip open the stitches and the wound. Dirt and bacteria on the dog's nails can also infect the wound. Scratching and rubbing can also cause swelling. If the wound swells too much, it might cause the stitches to break.  Make sure the dog doesn’t get muddy or get the incision dirty. This can cause infection or other complications. This means keeping him from going outside on his own or letting him roam around muddy or wooded areas.Don’t apply ointment, cream, disinfectants, or anything else without your vet’s permission. Don’t use solutions like hydrogen peroxide or alcohol because it can harm the healing process. You should change the dressing according to your vet’s orders. Make sure the dog’s bed is clean. Place a clean sheet or towel on the bed each night and replace when it becomes even lightly soiled.  Do not bathe your dog during the recovery period. The incision and stitches shouldn’t get wet. Moisture can encourage bacteria to multiply and cause an infection. In addition, moisture softens the skin, which makes it a less effective barrier against infection.   To keep the stitches and bandages dry when the dog goes outside, place a plastic bag or plastic clingwrap around the area when she goes outside. Just remove it as soon as the dog comes back inside., If there are no bandages, then look at the stitches a couple of times a day. This helps you notice changes or infections. This is very important for the healing of your dog.The healing wound should look clean with the edges touching each other. You may see some bruising around the incision, and the incision might be slightly redder than the skin around it.The incision might be slightly puffy or raised. Minor seepage, like a drop of clear or blood-stained fluid, may occur. However, if you notice abnormal swelling, steady seepage, thick discharge, or yellow-green discharge, contact your vet. Look for any swelling, heated skin, odor, discharge, irritation, or new damage., If you can’t keep the dog from licking or touching the stitches, you can cover the stitches. If the stitches are on the dog’s torso, try putting a t-shirt on him. Make sure it’s cotton, so it will breathe. Just make sure the t-shirt fits the dog and isn’t too large or too tight. You can tie the shirt to keep it from moving up the dog’s torso.This is helpful if you have multiple dogs and can’t keep them separated. You can also cover the stitches with a bandage. This might be necessary if the wound is on a limb. If the dog scratches at the wound with a back leg, try putting a snug-fitting sock on that paw so the nails can’t rip at the stitches. 

keep your dog from chewing or licking his stitches.  try not to let the dog scratch the stitches.  make sure the wound and stitches are clean.  keep the wound and stitches dry.  monitor the stitches.  cover the incision. 

 If you have a clique, invite the friends you hang out with, at school or at a club. This is the best way of ensuring a comfortable, fun night for everyone, as the tent is a small place and you must all be okay with close quarters. However, a tent sleepover can be an interesting, eventful night, so if you have 1 or 2 new friends, it's a good way of getting to know each other and talking!; , You could do it in a campsite, but if everyone is round your house, more anxious people may feel safer knowing there are adults and a toilet near by. A bigger tent is better, as there is not only room to sleep, but room to move about and play games.  Your guests don't want to be sleeping on a cold grassy floor. Make the tent look cosy and inviting, with mattresses, rolling mats, blanket, cushions and throws. If it's a birthday camping sleepover, you could put balloons in or around the tent. Make sure you have torches or a portable lamp so you have cosy lighting and you aren't stuck in the pitch black all night.  Ask your guests to bring a bag of sweets/chocolate/candy with them, and you can provide the rest. Bring popcorn, fizzy drinks (with plastic cups), pizza, sweets and chocolate. It may be a good idea to bring a small rubbish bin and put it in the tent for all the leftover treats.  Films are a great way of starting a night off, and usually don't last until the end. Try and choose a film that will get you all talking, like a scandalous rom-com or tear jerking drama. You could even watch some scary movies, if you're all brave enough!  , This game is a must for girly sleepovers. After the film, take one of your empty pop bottles and find a flat surface. All the girls sit in a circle around the bottle and one person spins it. Whoever the bottle top lands on is asked by the girls a question of Truth or Dare or Would You Rather. This is a great way to break the ice, have a laugh, and find out more about each other.  Bring in nail varnish, hair ties, bobby pins and make up and give each other makeovers! This is a fun, girly thing to do, and gives everyone something to do. You could even to a "Hairstyle Line", where you all sit behind each other and give the person in front of you a beautiful or crazy hairstyle.  Don't stay cooped up in the tent all night! You could play Flashlight Tag (use the light beam as a tag tap), Hide and Seek, or Wink Murder. If your parents let you, you could even have a campfire and toast marshmallows!  , You could make up your own or get some from the internet. Sit in a circle and take it in turns to read one with your best spooky voice. If everyone is feeling a little creeped out by the end, you could read some funny ones. Switch it up and have a play with it.  Go crazy. Beforehand you could make a sleepover playlist. Boogie to all of your favourite tunes and dance around in your sleeping bags! (Just make sure you don't wake up your parents!)  , If it's at night, make sure your phone or camera has a flash. Take creative, funny, or silly photos together with props or costumes. In the morning, while your guests are eating breakfast, you could print out the best pictures and give them to your friends as a souvenir!  

decide how many girls you'd like to invite, and who.  get a tent and find space in your yard.  decorate and fill your tent.  get loads of delicious food.  bring in a tablet or laptop and watch films.  play spin the bottle truth or dare/would you rather.  pamper each other.  play midnight games.  tell each other spooky stories.  listen to music and dance.  have a photoshoot. 

 To recognize a kinematic equation, you will need to know the units and variables that will be displayed in the equation. These include:   vf – final velocity vi – initial velocity a – acceleration xf – final position xi – initial position t – time; , There are established kinematic equations that you can learn. Keep in mind that when looking at kinematic equations, there are certain assumptions you must have. These include:   Knowing that the object being described as a constant acceleration Using a positive sign to represent horizontal motions going to the right, and vertical motions going upwards. Using the negative sign for movement to the left or downwards.  It helps to have the following equations memorized so that you can compare other equations, and recognize kinematic equations quickly.Velocity as a function of time: vf = vi + at Position as a function of velocity and time: xf = xi + 0.5(vi + vf)t Position as a function of time: xf = xi + vit + 0.5at2  Velocity as a function of position: vf2 = vi2 + 2a(xf – xi)  , For an equation to be considered kinematic, it must contain most or all of the variables listed in the last step of the previous section. It must also mirror one of the equations listed in the previous step. Let’s look at an example:   Take a look at: mv1 + F(t2-t1) = mv2  Let’s look at the variables in this equation: m, v, F, and t. Out of the four, only 2 parameters match those used in kinematic equations. It also does not mirror any of the forms of the equations; therefore this is not a kinematics equation.  Now let’s look at this example: y = yo + vot - 0.5gt2  The variables used are: y, v, g, and t. Out of the four, only v and t check out. But as we can see, this equation is very much similar with equation 3 of step 1 in terms of form. The variable y, denotes a vertical position, while g denotes gravity. Gravity has a value of 9.81 m/s2 – and we know that acceleration has a unit of m/s2. We can classify gravity as acceleration. However, there is no negative sign in , but still we don’t have minus sign in our equation 3. But since we know the a vertical displacement increases as we go up, and we also know that gravity pulls downward, we can assess that the negative sign is there to denote that gravity acts on the opposite direction. So the given equation is indeed a kinematics equation.  

recognize the variables you will be using.  familiarize yourself with the symbols used to represent movement in these equations.  familiarize yourself with the basic kinematic equations.  look at an example of an equation that is not kinematic, but resembles it.  look at an example of a kinematic equation.

 Look to see if you have any beads around your house or stop by your local craft store and pick up a pack of multiple colors and sizes. You can also use gems or crystals for surface piercings. Get fake gems and crystals at a craft store, or use real crystals that are from your necklaces or rings. Fake surface piercings can be as small or as large as you want.  Surface piercings are piercings that are only visible on the surface of your skin. The part of the piercing visible is usually a stud or crystal.   Surface piercings can be on your cheek, nose, above the eyebrow, and above or below your top or bottom lips, respectively. Try putting a fake surface piercing in only one place first to see how you feel, then add more if you want a bolder look.  Since you are not forcing any skin between two ends for these fake surface piercings, you only have to apply eyelash glue to one side of your bead, gem, or crystal. Eyelash glue is the best adhesive for fake facial piercings because it is already made for the skin, so it will last the longest and not be harmful. Choose an eyelash glue with a small applicator. Let the glue set on the ends for 20-30 seconds before applying to the skin.  Tweezers are the most effective when handling beads, gems, or crystals, especially considering their small size. You will be able to hold them steady and not get any glue on unwanted areas of your face. Place your bead, gem, or crystal where you want your surface piercing.  

acquire multiple beads or crystals.  decide where you want your piercing.  apply eyelash glue to one side.  use tweezers to place your piercing. 

 You can also use parchment paper, plastic wrap, or even wax paper.This will make cleaning up at the end easier.  If you want to make more than one color, you can use a second or third baking sheet. You can also make smaller patches of colored sand on one large baking sheet, but be sue to leave some space between each one!, The best place to work in would be outdoors. If this is not possible, a large room with windows open might also work. You need good ventilation in the next step so that you don't get lightheaded., You can use any type of waterproofing spray for fabric, such as Scotchgard. Keep spraying until the sand is damp. The spray will make the sand resistant to water and keep it dry., Allow the sand to dry for about 10 minutes first. Stir it up with a spoon, fork, your fingers, or even a toy rake. Spray it once more in a thick, even layer. You want the sand to be damp but not soaking wet.  If the sand still doesn't feel evenly coated, you can repeat this step for good measure, especially if you have a lot of sand., It will take about 30 to 60 minutes for it to do so. It may take longer, however, if you have a lot of sand and it's a damp day., Choose a container that is easy to pour from, such as a mini jar. If you made multiple colors, pour one color into each jar. If you dried your sand on parchment or wax paper, you can use that to funnel the sand into the container., The container does not have to be clear, but if it's clear, you'll be able to see your designs from the side! Vases, large mason jars, and even old (but clean) aquariums make great choices!, You can pour it straight from the jar or you can use a funnel. You can even pour it into a plastic squeeze bottle first, then squeeze it into the water., Grab a clump, pull it out of the water, and watch how it "magically" becomes dry again., If you want to make a more permanent display, fill a small, plastic aquarium with water, and pour the sand in. You can create different looks by pouring the sand from a cup, through a funnel, or out of a squeeze bottle. Create some mounds and pillars. Lastly, add some ocean-related figurines inside, such as fish, shells, or mermaids!, You can do this using your hands, a spoon, or even a cup. If you used multiple colors, consider using a spoon to scoop individual colors out. You might still get a few specks of other colors, but it is still a good way to preserve the original color., The sand won't get wet, but there may be some beads of water cleaning to it. If you spot any, spread the sand out on a sheet of parchment paper, and wait for the water to evaporate.If you don't have parchment paper, you can use wax paper instead.  If you had to "dry" the sand, use the parchment/wax paper to funnel it back into its container. Put the cap or lid back on so that the sand doesn't spill. 

cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil.  spread some colored sand in a thin layer onto the baking sheet.  take the baking sheet to a well-ventilated area.  spray the sand with waterproof fabric protecting spray.  let the sand dry, then spray it again.  leave the sand out to dry.  transfer the sand into a sealable container.  fill a clear container with water.  pour the sand into the water.  poke, prod, and squish the sand.  consider making a scene.  take the sand out of the water when you are done playing with it.  let the sand dry off, if necessary.  store the sand back in its container. 

          Cook the beans or drain canned beans as above. Alternatively, cook the pinto using a pressure cooker (in which case, it should only take a half hour). Add oil to a cast iron skillet or pan. Add chopped onions and fry. Add a little bit of hot water, about 1/4 cup per cup of cooked beans. Add the beans and allow to heat gently in the hot water. Mash the beans. Let them cook until all liquid is absorbed. Serve. Mashed pinto beans have many uses, from filling to spreads, to being a simple but tasty side dish. Follow your recipe's suggestions if including in a dish.  Presoak 1 pound/450g of pinto beans as outlined above, then add fresh water to cover the beans by at least an inch or two (2.5-5cm).          Add 1 large chopped onion, 1 chopped clove of garlic, 1 seeded and chopped jalapeño, 1/2 teaspoon oregano, 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin, a dash of cayenne and freshly ground pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low and pop on a lid. Cook for 2-3 hours, or until the beans are tender. Stir at least every 1/2 hour and add more water if needed, to keep the beans always covered. Add salt to taste just before serving. Garnish with chopped tomatoes, shredded cilantro and shredded cheese.  Note: This recipe is an exception to not adding seasonings when the beans cook. What matters is that the salt is not added until the very end of cooking.  Cut raw vegetables, such as celery and carrot sticks and add some dipping chips for a tasty snack.  If a stew calls for adding beans to it, use the pinto beans. Or, make a pinto bean stew from scratch.         

make re-fried beans.  make pinto bean soup.  use as a tasty dip.  add to stews. 

 If you bit into something hard and felt pain, it’s possible that the pain will go away if you wait momentarily. A visit to an emergency dentist may incur expensive bills. Some indications that you have an emergency dental issue include:A severe toothache that does not respond to painkillers An abscess (an infection in the gum, usually marked by a painful, pus-filled, pimple-like swelling) An object stuck in your mouth A lost filling that causes intense pain Bleeding that will not stop Broken braces or wires A tooth knocked out, broken, or fractured A broken or cracked crown If you are bleeding profusely, are in severe pain, or have a fever over 104°F (40°C), call 911 or go to the emergency room. Don’t pause to contact a dentist.; , If you have knocked out a tooth or have an abscess or open wound, dirty hands can cause an infection. You shouldn’t handle broken teeth without washing your hands with soap and water first.Though you may be feeling panicked, it is important you take this step. Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds under warm, running water.  It’s possible that your dentist can repair broken teeth using the pieces that fell off, but you must keep them moist.   A small container of milk (preferably whole milk) will keep the tooth moist very effectively. If you don’t have milk, you or a friend can spit into a small container. Place the tooth inside, and try to cover it with the saliva. Water does not work well for this. It starts to break down the tooth after a short amount of time. If you have no other choice, mix a spoonful of salt into the water to make a saline solution, which is much better for storing your tooth. If you don’t have a container, you can keep the tooth moist inside your mouth. Give the tooth a quick rinse under water, then place it next to your cheek, and be very careful not to swallow it., If a tooth fell completely out, your best chance of saving it is to get it back into your mouth quickly. This will prevent it from drying out. Make sure the end of the root is rounded and there are no sharp edges. Move fast as the blood in the socket may clot — there is a very brief amount of time in which the root surface of the tooth can be kept alive.Pick up knocked-out teeth by the tops (the parts that you chew with), not the roots. Rinse it off using only water. Do not use chemicals or soap. It doesn’t need to be sterile, just be sure it’s not covered in dirt. If the tooth never left your mouth, you can skip this step. Place it gently back into the socket. Hold it in place until you get to the dentist by gently biting down on gauze or keeping your fingers on it. If the tooth that came out is a baby tooth, do NOT try to replace it in the socket. You could damage an adult tooth that is coming in under it.  Wear gloves if you can. Use gauze or a similar cloth if possible. As a last resort, you can apply pressure with your bare hands, but clean, dry cloth is preferable.   Apply pressure for at least 15 minutes. Resist the urge to peek. Apply additional cloths if the blood soaks through. Do not remove the blood-soaked cloth, as this may disrupt the clotting process., This is the best place to start in a dental emergency. If you are calling during normal business hours, your dentist may be able to fit you. If you are calling after hours or on weekends, your dentist’s answering service may have a number for you to call in an emergency.  Use a search engine and type in the name of your city and “emergency dentist.” Try searching in neighboring large cities if you don’t get many results with your own city, consider typing in the name of a neighboring large city with “emergency dentist.”   Try using something like Yelp or Google Maps. Typically, a search for “emergency dentist” and your city will yield a map of dentists in your area in the search results. Use this map to determine which ones you can get to quickly. Especially if you have lost a tooth, it is best to get to a dentist within half an hour. Sometimes a dentist can save your tooth up to an hour after you lost it, but sooner is best.If you are in too much pain to drive safely, and if you cannot get a ride from a friend or family member, you may want to prioritize calling the emergency dentists closest to you so that you can walk or take a cab. Some dental clinics advertise their services on Facebook, so this may be another resource to locate an emergency dental office.  If your search didn't help you come up with a good list of options, you may need to look into other possibilities. Some sites exist purely for the purpose of locating dentists. Such sites often include a number to call for an emergency dentist. Others will give you the numbers of many local dentists. Try:   1-800-Dentist: http://www.1800dentist.com/  Emergency Dental Care USA: https://www.emergencydental.com/  Emergency Dentists USA: http://www.emergencydentistsusa.com/   , Many companies continue to advertise in print media, particularly if they want to attract business from clients who do not have access to the internet.  Before you waste your time calling every dentist that appears in the search results, click on the actual websites to confirm that they offer emergency services. Then, call the dentist closest to you. Move outward to those less conveniently located.   Unless you are in a position to pay out-of-pocket, it’s also a good idea to use the websites to determine whether the dentist you find will accept your insurance. You can usually determine this from the website. If not, you can confirm when you call. If you reach an answering service, leave your name and number, and describe your emergency. Do not assume that leaving a message will get you an appointment. Move on to another number after you have left a message, because you never know how long it will take the answering service to get back to you. Don’t stop calling until you have reached an actual human being and made an appointment, preferably with a dentist who will accept your insurance.  Sometimes they offer reduced rate clinics, and in rare cases they take on patients for free. Experienced dental faculty supervise students., If you cannot find an emergency dentist, a general practitioner may at least be able to provide you with painkillers and other temporary solutions until you can make an appointment with an actual dentist.   You could also go to an urgent care center. Odds are good that if your dentist office is closed, many general practitioners are as well.  If you have exhausted all other options, the ER may be able to help. Though they likely will not have someone who can perform extensive dental procedures, the ER can probably help manage your pain.  

decide if you have an emergency or not.  wash your hands before putting them in your mouth.  save broken pieces of teeth.  place knocked out teeth back in your mouth if possible.  control any bleeding by applying direct pressure.  call your general dentist.  search online for a dentist.  search a site that specializes in locating dentists.  check the yellow pages or your local newspaper for dentist ads.  call dentists.  explore local university dental schools.  call a general practitioner.  go to the emergency room as a last resort. 

 While not all personality tests are created equal, some personality tests can tell you more about who you are. For instance, the Myers-Briggs is a common test that will divide you among two options in four categories.You can also try the Big Five personality test.Use your results. Once you get your results, it will help you understand more about how you make decisions and who you are as person. It will also help you understand how you interact with other people and why you may respond in certain ways to specific situations.For instance, if you're an introvert, knowing that will help you understand why you may feel drained after parties and how you can take steps to manage your energy; , Write down the three things you consider your biggest accomplishments. What do these times have in common? In turn, consider what believe to be your biggest failures. What do those have in common?, That is, given your accomplishments and failures, consider how you acted to get there or how you would act differently now. If one of your biggest accomplishments was getting a degree, that means you consider hard work and dedication important. If one of your biggest failures was getting drunk and cheating on a girlfriend, that means you believe you have had problems with overindulging and not keeping promises and want to do those things differently., Consider the people you admire most. What do you admire about them? What qualities do they have that you wish you did? What values do they have? Those values are likely ones you wish you had, too., To figure out your values, you need to consider what's most important in your life. Maybe it's your family, or maybe it's your friendships.One way to figure out what you value is to ask yourself some questions. For instance, what would you carry out of your house if it were on fire (besides your family and pets)? What would you do to change the world, if you could? What makes you passionate? The recurring themes that you find help make up your values., For instance, you may have realized that hard work is important to you. That means it's one of your values. You have also noticed that moderation and fidelity are also important to you and part of your values., It's easy to have values in a vacuum. However, what defines you as a person is how you put those values in action. People are said to have integrity when they follow through on their values, so if you want to be a person of integrity, you must follow through on what you believe., Who you are personality-wise and what values you have define your actions. That is, say you value your family over anyone else. That means that you will chose your family over, say, your job or other obligations. However, if you value your work, you may choose not to have a family at all, which is also a valid choice. What you do becomes who you are.   Once you realize how your values have defined you as a person, you can put that into words. For instance, if you value your family above all else, maybe you consider yourself a "family person," while if you value you work, you might say "I'm passionate about my work."  

try online personality tests.  consider your biggest accomplishments.  identify what you've learned.  look at people you admire.  ask yourself what's most important to you.  incorporate what you've learned into value statements.  use your values to guide your decisions.  let your values define you. 

 Federal law requires that you be paid 1.5 times your base pay for each hour worked over 40 hours in a week.You should first calculate your base rate of pay. For example, if you are paid $12.00 an hour, then this is your regular rate of pay.   If you are paid a salary, then you need to divide your salary by 40 hours in order to get a regular rate of pay. Under federal law, a worker with a base pay of $12.00 will earn $18.00 in overtime pay.; , States can also pass their own overtime laws provided the state law is more generous to workers than the federal law. In California, for example, you can get overtime pay if you work more than eight hours in a day. If you work more than 12 in a day, then you get double pay.For example, if you work 10 hours in a day, then you must be paid overtime for the two extra hours on that day, even if you work 40 hours or less for the entire week. California also grants overtime pay if you work seven consecutive days. On the seventh day, you earn 1.5 your regular rate of pay. If you work more than eight hours on the seventh day, then you earn double the pay. To find your state’s overtime rules, you should contact your state’s Department of Labor. You can find contact information on the Internet.  Before you can choose between comp time and overtime pay, you should calculate how much you will be paid if you work overtime. For example, if your regular rate of pay is $12.00, then you will earn $18.00 for every hour of overtime.   If you worked 50 hours in a week, then you would earn $480.00 in regular pay and then an additional $180.00 in overtime pay. Your total paycheck would be $660.00.  Each state has an agency that handles wage and hour issues. It is usually the Department of Labor. You can direct any questions you have about how overtime pay is calculated to the agency.   To find your state agency, you can visit the Workplace Fairness website. They have a map of the United States.Click on your state, and you will be provided with the name and contact information of your state’s agency.  It is a common misconception that you will earn one comp time hour for each extra hour worked in a week.However, federal law mandates that you be given 1.5 hours in compensatory time for each extra hour worked in a week unless you are exempt from the federal overtime laws.Before you can choose between overtime pay and comp time, you should understand how the comp time is calculated. Look at your employee manuals, which should explain the formula. If nothing is listed in the manual or in your employment contract, then contact Human Resources. If you are unionized, then read your collective bargaining agreement. This agreement should spell out how compensatory time is calculated.  Your employer might try to put limits on when you can take your extra time off. You should know this before choosing between comp time and overtime pay. You don’t want to choose comp time based on a false belief that you can take the time whenever you want.   You can ask your supervisor about the policy on taking comp time. However, you should also check with coworkers, who are more likely to be honest with you. If you are new to a workplace, then ask other people in comparable positions if they have had a problem taking time off. If you have been with the organization for some time, then think about how difficult it has been to get vacation days off. An employer who tries to limit your use of vacation or personal days is unlikely to let you take comp time. Your employer may also decide to send you home when work is slow. To get paid, you would then use your comp time.This might not be an ideal situation for you because you do not control when you take your comp time. You should ask your employer whether this is a possibility.  You should understand the policies for “cashing out” accrued comp time. For example, you might want to accrue comp time during the year and then decide at year’s end whether to cash out the comp time.   If your employer is flexible about cashing out comp time, then it is a more attractive option than overtime, since you can’t convert overtime pay into extra time off from work.  You might be limited in the maximum number of comp time hours you can accrue. You should know this fact as well. For example, federal law generally limits the maximum number of comp hours to 240.State law and workplace policies might also limit the total amount of comp hours you can carry at any one time.   If you work in a seasonal, emergency response, or public safety activity, then you can accrue up to 480 hours under the federal law., If you are given the choice between comp time and overtime pay, you should consider which you need more: extra money or extra time off. This may or may not be an easy choice.   Think about any major expenses you have on the horizon: home repairs, health care costs, trips for vacation, etc. Check if you have the money to cover the costs. If not, you might want to take overtime over comp time. Also consider demands on your time. You might need time off to take care of a sick relative, take an extended vacation, recover from surgery, or finish education requirements. If you can’t easily fit these demands into your schedule, then you might decide that comp time is more important than overtime pay. Be sure to discuss your decision with friends and family. You should get feedback from the people closest to you about whether or not you should take compensatory time or overtime. Your children, for example, can let you know about upcoming events that you might want to attend.  You might not care whether or not you take overtime or comp time; nevertheless, your employer might have a strong preference for one over the other. Sometimes, employers are worried about paying too much in salary and would prefer that their employees take comp time.   You should consider how important it is to keep your employer happy. If you are new at a job or do not want to make waves for any reason, then you should try to take whichever your employer prefers. You can ask your boss if he or she has a preference for whether or not you accept overtime or comp time.  Your income tax is based on the income that you earn in a year.This includes your overtime pay. Before accepting overtime pay, you need to calculate how the extra pay will impact your taxes.   You should meet with a tax professional to discuss the consequences of taking overtime pay. To find a qualified tax professional, see Hire an Accountant.  

calculate your regular rate of pay.  find your state overtime laws.  estimate how much overtime you would earn.  call your state agency with questions.  figure out how comp time is calculated.  ask if you can take comp time whenever you want.  ask about “cashing out” comp time.  check the maximum number of hours you can accrue.  determine how much money you need.  figure out if your employer has a preference.  understand the tax consequences. 

 Layering is one of the best means to transition a wardrobe item from summer to fall. If you don't want to put away your favorite band t-shirt or summer dress, some layering allows you to wear the item into the fall months.Throw on a nice button down jacket or cardigan over a shorter sleeved t-shirt. This will make the item warm enough for fall. You can also add a jacket or blazer to a shorter sleeved dress in order to wear it through the fall.In addition to saving a dress with a jacket, a long-sleeved or 3/4 sleeved t-shirt can be worn under a short sleeve or sleeveless dress.; , If you want to save a summer skirt, dress, or a pair of shorts, you can wear tights with them. A cute pair of tights under a skirt, dress, or shorts can be a great addition to a fall wardrobe. You'll be able to keep your shorter items of clothing out of storage into the fall.In addition to keeping you warm, you can use tights to add in fall colors. If you have, say, a white skirt, you can wear with a pair of shorts in a warmer color, like orange or amber. This will give your outfit a look more appropriate with fall.  Hoodies can be fashionable in more casual settings. If you're, say, going out with friends, throw a zip up hoodie on over a t-shirt. This will allow you to wear something with shorter sleeves well into the fall months.In addition to zip-up hoodies, you can wear a hoodie with no zip over a shorter dress for a cute, casual look. As with tights, hoodies can be used to add fall colors. If you have a hoodie in a warmer shade, throw it on over a short sleeve item that's brighter.  There's no need to throw out the sandals right away. As long as it's warm enough, it's appropriate to keep wearing sandals with heavier fall items. You can also wear an in-between shoe item, like work boots, desert boots, or dress shoes.You can also start wearing socks with a more summery shoe to transition into the fall. Flats can be an excellent choice as they're appropriate for both the summer and winter months., You don't need to make the transition all at once. It will look smoother and more natural if you gradually incorporate warmer colors into your wardrobe. As the season goes on, you can gradually transition brighter colors out completely.Fall colors are colors that have an earthy tone, like oranges, browns, golds, darker blues, and burgundies. You can add a dash of warmer colors here and there, like a burgundy blazer over a lighter shirt, and gradually add more and more warm colors as the season goes on. A good way to make the transition easier is to look for lighter, more summery clothing in fall shades. This will help bridge the gap between the warmer and colder months.  As with color, you don't want to suddenly switch to fall fabrics. You can start adding more fall appropriate fabric choices here and there. Mix and match fall and summer fabrics for a smooth transition into the fall.Cashmere, wool, tweed, and flannel are typically associated with the fall months. It can be awkward, however, to jump into a wardrobe defined by these fabrics. There will probably be days in the fall that are slightly warmer, and you may be uncomfortable in something that's, say, completely flannel. You can add fall fabrics by incorporating items that won't keep you too warm on the early days of fall. Add wool socks, for example, or a tweed tie. You can also have something you can easily remove in a fall fabric. For example, wear a flannel button-down underneath a lighter t-shirt.  Leather is always stylish and it can keep you warm in the fall months. You can add bits of leather to your wardrobe to stay warm as you're transitioning your summer pieces into fall.You can wear a leather skirt or pair of leather leggings with a more summery top. A leather jacket can be worn over a lighter t-shirt.  As fall comes around, bolder and clunkier jewelry is appropriate. More delicate jewelry may be difficult to see under heavier items. As you start to add things like turtlenecks and scarves, opt for larger pieces of jewelry to compensate,Go for things like statement necklaces and necklaces with large pendants or beads. Bigger earrings may also make your jewelry more noticeable in fall. You can try dangly earrings, hoop earrings, or other bigger items.  Hats are always in style, and can keep you warm as fall approaches. As it warms up, you can add a hat to most outfits for a nice accessory.A knitted hat can be particularly nice for fall, as it's a typical fall fashion that will keep you warm. You can also try incorporating fall colors with your hats. You can, for example, add a brown knit cap to an outfit that has more summer colors.  You can use accessories to help on days that get cooler. You can wear a scarf out, a leather belt, or a cardigan to both keep warm and accessorize.Have a variety of scarves of different shapes, sizes, and textures. This way, if the weather varies in your area, you will always have a scarf that's appropriate. You can wear a lighter scarf on warmer days, and a longer, thicker one as it cools down.  If you wear ties, a tie is a good way to smoothly add some fall color. If you're still wearing button-down shirts with a summery color, add a tie in a warmer shade. This will help you make the transition from summer to fall colors more gradual., As fall rolls around, you'll want warmer colors for your makeup. You can start with small tweaks, like a warmer lipstick, and eventually start using warmer shades of eye shadow and slightly heavier eyeliner. A cat eye can be a good look for fall.You can switch from bright pastel eye shadows to darker, warmer colors. You may also want to change to more weather resistant types of makeup, such as waterproof makeup, as fall may come with harsh winds, rain, and snow.  

layer appropriately.  incorporate tights.  add a hoodie to your wardrobe.  transition your summer shoes smoothly.  start incorporating warmer colors.  add fall fabrics gradually.  use leather to stay warm.  add bolder jewelry.  start wearing hats.  use accessories to keep warm.  incorporate fall color with a tie.  change your makeup style for fall. 

 Some states offer statutory will forms, which are will templates created by the state legislature and written into state law. Residents of the state can use the form at no charge. The difference between a statutory will form and a regular will form is that the text of a statutory will form cannot be changed and, therefore, cannot be tailored to the individual needs of a particular person. The form must be used exactly as written with the blanks filled in with the testator’s information.Statutory will forms are provided by only a handful of states. These states, as of the time of writing, are California, Maine, Michigan, New Mexico, and Wisconsin.Check the relevant laws of your state to determine if your state offers a statutory will form, as the list of states that offer these forms may change in the future. Do not use the statutory will form of a state in which you are not resident.; , If your state does offer statutory will forms, keep in mind the pros and cons of statutory will forms. Statutory will forms may have advantages but they are not right for everyone.One benefit of a statutory will form is that the form is free and easy to find and use for any resident of the state. Another benefit is that the language of the will created using a statutory will form is very difficult to challenge because the forms are familiar to the courts of the state and the language has been produced by the state legislature. The forms are also simple to use and can be used without the aid of a lawyer or other costly wills program or book.One major disadvantage of using a statutory will form is that you cannot tailor the form to your particular situation, since statutory will forms are “one-size-fits-all documents.”Using a statutory will form may be a good idea if you need a will in an emergency and do not have time for a lawyer or for going out to buy a wills program or book (e.g. the night before going on a vacation).Using a statutory will form is a good idea if the state’s form accurately reflects the testator’s wishes. Your wishes may be very simple (e.g. you want everything to go to your spouse), and, in that case, a statutory will form may fit your needs perfectly. In more complex situations, however, you may wish to use a form that allows you to tailor the language to your particular needs., Statutory will forms, if offered by your state, are available online. Download the form, fill in the blanks online (if the form is a fillable PDF) or print the form and fill in legibly in ink. Currently, the states that offer statutory will forms are California, Maine, Michigan, New Mexico, and Wisconsin.   A statutory will form for California residents is available at http://www.calbar.ca.gov/portals/0/documents/publications/Will-Form.pdf. Guidelines on how to write a statutory will in Michigan are available at http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(pi0arklnsbebckqkbevoth2l))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-700-2519&query=on&highlight=statutory%20AND%20will. Guidelines on how to write a statutory will in Maine are available at http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/statutes/18-a/title18-Asec2-514.html. A statutory will form for New Mexico residents is available at https://www.docracy.com/3249/new-mexico-form-of-statutory-will. Guidelines on how to write a statutory will in Wisconsin are available at https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/853/II/55.  Do not make any changes to the existing language of the statutory will form. Simply fill in the blanks according to the information requested in each blank. Note that some information may be optional while other information is required. The form will ask you a number of questions related to how you wish to distribute your property and cash and to whom., After you are finished filling out the form, date and sign the will in the presence of adult witnesses. California requires that the will be signed in the presence of 2 adult witnesses (notarization is not sufficient by itself). The witnesses must be read out a number of instructions and statements from the testator before they (the witnesses) sign the will.Check your state’s laws for rules pertaining to witnessing a will.

 You will use cardboard to trace your patterns on your leather. Take a small piece of cardboard, such as cardboard from a shoebox, and draw a circle shape on the cardboard in pen.In order to make sure your circle shape is perfectly round, try tracing around a circle-shaped object such as a bottle cap. After drawing your circle, carefully cut out the circle using a pair of scissors. Go slowly so your circle stays even.; , On the back side of the leather, use a fabric pen to trace around your cardboard circle. Trace the circle twice, as these shapes will be your earrings.When selecting your leather, choose a color or pattern you like. If you want earrings for a red outfit, for example, use red leather.  Use fabric scissors to carefully cut around each circle. Go slowly. You do not want to cut uneven circles for your earrings. This will make your final product look sloppy., Take a small hole puncher. Use it to punch two holes in either earring, near the top of your circles. This is so the circles will dangle downward when you put the hoops in.Use the smallest hole puncher possible. It's not necessary to have very large holes in your earrings.  You can buy earring hooks at most craft stores. You will have to use pliers or your fingers to gently twist open the loop at the end of the hook. Fit the hook through the holes you made in each earring.Once you've fitted the loop through the hook, use your pliers or fingers to close the hook again. Make sure you close the hook completely. You don't want your earrings to slip off and get lost.  

cut a circle shape out of cardboard.  trace the shape onto the back of your leather.  cut out your circles.  use a hole puncher to create a hole.  fit an earring hook through your hole. 

 The risk of having a first-time blood clot (VTE) is 100 in 100,000. However, that risk goes up exponentially as we age: by age 80, the rate of VTE is 500 in 100,000.As you get older, it’s important to monitor your overall health with regular medical checkups.   Recent surgery or a broken bone in your hips or legs increases your risk of blood clots.; , People who sit more than six hours a day in their leisure time are twice as likely to have pulmonary embolism of those sit for less than two hours. Prolonged periods of lying, sitting, or standing in one place can cause blood stasis, leading to clots. This is one reason why VTE is so common in hospitalized patients, especially after surgery, and people traveling long distances.  People who fall in to the obese category have a much higher risk of VTE than those in a healthy weight range.The correlation is not completely understood, but experts believe at least part of it is due to the estrogen produced by fat cells. Estrogen is an independent risk factor for blood clots.Fat cells also produce proteins called “cytokines,” which may play a role in formation of VTE.Though not always the case, the obese may also lead more sedentary lives than those who fall into healthier weight ranges.   To calculate your BMI, use an online BMI calculator, like the one on the Mayo Clinic website. You will need to input your age, height, weight, and sex for your results. An obese person will have a BMI of 30 or more. The overweight range is from 25-29.9, and normal from 18.5 to 24.9. Anything below 18.5 is considered underweight.  This is often seen in postmenopausal women who take estrogen supplements as part of hormone replacement therapy. Women who take hormonal contraception to prevent pregnancy and those who are pregnant are also at risk.   Before beginning any hormone therapy, discuss the risks and your options with your doctor.  Without it, you would bleed to death if you cut yourself! While coagulation is normal, hypercoagulation is when the blood clots too much, even when it's still in the body. Hypercoagulation can be caused by long periods of sitting or lying down, cancer, dehydration, smoking, and hormone therapies.You are at risk of hypercoagulation if:   You have a family history of abnormal blood clots. You personally had a blood clot at young age. You had blood clots during pregnancy. You've suffered from multiple unexplained miscarriages. Some genetic disorders, such as Factor 5 Leiden Disorder or Lupus Anticoagulant, can also cause this condition.  Atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) and the build up of cholesterol plaques in your arteries can all lead to blood clots.If you have atrial fibrillation, your blood isn't flowing properly, and may pool and begin to clot.People with atrial fibrillation may notice an irregular pulse but no other symptoms; it is usually discovered during routine check-ups. It can be treated with blood thinners or other medications, lifestyle changes, and in some cases a pacemaker or surgery.Waxy cholesterol plaques can build up in your arteries (sometimes as part of atherosclerosis) and, if the plaques break, they can begin the clotting process.Most heart attacks and strokes occur when plaque in your heart or brain bursts., Studies show that 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise a week decreases your risk of many health problems.This averages to 20-30 minutes of aerobic activity (walking, cycling, aerobics, etc.) a day. Choose an activity you enjoy enough to stick with! Exercise keeps your circulation flowing, improving your overall health and preventing VTE.  You can do this while resting or during sleep. Elevate your legs from your feet, not your knees; so, don't prop pillows under your knees to try and elevate them. Instead, raise your feet about six inches above your heart. Avoid crossing your legs.  While it's important to get exercise on a daily basis, it's not enough to sit all day, then run for 20 minutes. If you're sitting or lying down for long periods of time — for example, if you're traveling, work at a computer, or are on bedrest — you need to take exercise breaks. Every two hours, get up and do some light activity. You can just walk around or do stationary calf exercises by rocking back and forth on your heels and toes.   Any situation where you're seated with your legs flexed at the knee (the typical sitting position) puts you at risk. , Severe dehydration "thickens" the blood and promotes clot formation.Everyone, but especially the elderly and others in high-risk categories, should drink plenty of water. The Institute of Medicine suggests men drink 13 cups of fluids (three liters) per day, and women drink nine cups (2.2 liters).Never let yourself get thirsty. Thirst is the first, most obvious sign of dehydration. If you are feeling thirsty, you are already on your way toward dehydration. Another early sign a dry mouth or extremely dry skin. Drinking water immediately should be enough to rehydrate the body. If you are suffering from diarrhea or vomiting, or are sweating excessively, you may need an electrolyte solution like Gatorade to rehydrate.  High estrogen states put women at a higher risk of VTE. But during pregnancy, there's nothing you can do about how much estrogen your body's producing. All you can do is try to avoid other risk factors (like smoking or long periods of sitting) and make sure your situation is being monitored by a medical professional.   If you develop a VTE in a limb, the doctor can prescribe pregnancy-safe medication to prevent it from traveling to the lungs or brain and becoming potentially fatal. There are risks to taking blood thinners while pregnant, as it can interfere with the attachment of the placenta. However, in high-stakes VTE situations, Lovenox can potentially save lives. After delivery, the mother will switch to Coumadin, which is safe during breastfeeding.VTE is the leading cause of maternal death in the United States and Western Europe., HRT medications, taken to control the symptoms of menopause, place you at an increased risk of blood clots. A non-hormonal alternative is to try a soy isoflavone treatment like Estroven, which helps with hot flashes but has no VTE risk. You can also get soy from dietary sources like soybeans, soymilk, or tofu. There are, however, no guidelines available to help with dosing.You can also choose to simply live with the symptoms of menopause without treatment. While uncomfortable, they are not bad for your health in any way.  The overall risk for healthy women without other risk factors is still pretty low, though — about one in 3,000 experience VTE.   Women who bleed heavily during menstruation or have abnormal uterine lining should choose non-hormonal options, if available. Non-estrogen (progesterone only) hormonal contraceptives or even non-hormonal choices such as certain IUDs can be considered. Even if you have a history or risk of blood clots, hormonal contraception can still be taken if you take anticoagulant medication. Your doctor may also choose a very low estrogen form (or even non-estrogen form) of hormonal contraception, which can reduce your risk.  Because the excess of fat cells found in obesity is correlated with VTE risk, you should try to bring your weight down to healthy levels if you are obese (BMI of 30 or greater). The healthiest way to lose weight is through a combination of exercise and responsible dieting. Although you should limit your caloric intake, most nutritionists warn against eating less than 1,200 calories a day.That number may be higher if you're exercising a lot. Consult your dietician for your personal recommendations.   Wear a heart rate monitor while exercising to track your heart rate. To calculate your target heart rate, first find your maximum heart rate: 220 - your age.Multiply that number by .6 to find your target heart rate, and try to sustain that rate for at least 20 minutes while exercising at least 4 times a week. For example, for a 50 year old woman, the target heart rate would be (220-50) x .6 = 102.  Compression hose are also known as TET, or thromboembolism-deterrent, hose. People who are on their feet for long hours, such as servers or nurses and doctors, often wear them to improve circulation. They can also be worn after you've already suffered from blood clots to relieve leg pain and swelling.They're sometimes used with hospital patients who spend a lot of time on bed rest.   You can buy compression hose at most drugstores or pharmacies. They only need to be knee high to improve circulation.  If your doctor feels like you are at high risk for a VTE, he may choose to put you on preventive medication. Depending on your individual assessment, he may recommend prescription (Coumadin or Lovenox) or over-the-counter medication, such as aspirin.   Coumadin is a prescribed drug usually taken in one 5 mg oral dose per day.However, in different people, it can produce different interactions with vitamin K, which is critical for normal blood clotting. Thus, dosages can vary wildly. Lovenox is a prescription injection you can give yourself at home.You will get pre-loaded syringes that need to be administered twice daily. The dosage depends on your weight. Aspirin is a good over-the-counter option for lower risk patient.It's been proven to prevent thrombotic events from blood clots to stroke and heart attack.  One in five patients with malignant cancer will experience a VTE.This results from a multitude of reasons, including cancer-related inflammation, lack of mobility, or medication side-effects.Cancer patients who get a VTE will be placed on Lovenox or Coumadin and may get an IVC (inferior vena cava) filter. An IVC filter acts like a strainer in case a deep vein clot breaks off from a leg vein. It prevents the clot from reaching the heart or lungs, where it could prove lethal., Although there's anecdotal literature on natural therapies to reduce clot risk in cancer patients, there's no scientific backing to it. It's been argued that phytonutrients can prevent VTE in cancer patients.However, there's no known mechanism that would cause this diet to inhibit inflammation and cytokine production, as argued. Foods suggested in this diet include:   Fruits: Apricots, oranges, blackberries, tomatoes, pineapple, plums, blueberries. Spices: Curry, cayenne, paprika, thyme, turmeric, ginger, ginko, licorice. Vitamins: Vitamin E (walnuts and almonds, lentils, oats and wheats) and Omega 3 fatty acids (fatty fish such as salmon or trout). Plant Sources: sunflower seeds, canola oil, safflower oil. Supplements: Garlic, Ginko biloba, Vitamin C, nattokinase supplements. Wine and honey.  

raise your awareness with age.  consider your activity level.those who lead a sedentary or inactive lifestyle are at higher risk of pulmonary embolism, or a blood clot in the lungs.  calculate your body mass index (bmi).  pay attention to your hormone levels.hormonal shifts, especially those involving estrogen, can put people at risk of vte.  be aware of a hypercoagulation.coagulation is just another word for clotting, which is a normal process for your blood.  learn about other health conditions that increase the risk of blood clots.  exercise regularly.  elevate your legs periodically throughout the day.  break up long periods of sitting with activity.  stay hydrated.  get regular checkups during pregnancy.  discuss alternatives to hormone replacement therapy (hrt) with your doctor.  take hormonal contraceptive only after medical recommendation.the combination of estrogen and progestin in most birth control pills can raise your risk of blood clots by three to four times.  maintain a healthy weight.  wear compression hose or socks.  talk to your doctor about preventative medication.  ask for medication specifically if you have cancer.  take natural treatments with a grain of salt. 

 There are certain medications that can help combat a yeast infection on your skin. For skin infections, doctors generally recommend antifungal creams that are applied directly to the affected area. These creams will generally clear the infection within a couple of week. The two most common antifungal creams for yeast infections on the skin include miconazole and oxiconazole. The cream have general instructions for application, but make sure you follow the doctor's instructions carefully.   To use cream for your skin yeast infections, wash the affected area with water and then dry it off very thoroughly. The skin should not be moist at all. Apply the recommended amount of cream as indicated by your doctor or the manufacturer's instructions. Let it absorb into your skin before you reapply clothing or do any activities that might cause the area to rub against another object or material. , To fight a vaginal yeast infection, you can get over the counter medications or get a prescription from your doctor. For infrequent episodes of yeast infections that only have mild to moderate symptoms, you can use over the counter medication that either comes as a cream, tablet, or suppository that gets inserted directly into your vagina.The common yeast-fighting medical creams include miconazole (Monistat) and terconazole (Terazol). They are generally used as a cream or suppository, given intravaginally every day at bedtime, for as many days as specified in the instructions. You can get medications that last one to seven days. You can also get oral antifungal medication that can be taken, such as clotrimazole (Myecelex) and fluconazole (Diflucan), which you take by mouth. You can also take clotrimazole as tablets, which are taken intravaginally at 100mg every day at bedtime for six to seven days, 200mg every night for 3 days, or 500mg daily for 1 day.Some yeast infections may be more complicated. These have to be treated for seven to 14 days, rather than one to seven days.  Boric acid is available for yeast infections as a vaginal insert suppository by a prescription. This may provide relief from infections that occur frequently if conventional treatments have not been as effective as expected. Additionally, boric acid may provide increased resistance against other strains of candida that may have become resistant to certain antibiotics over time.   Boric acid is toxic, especially to children when ingested, and can cause irritation to skin.Abstain from oral sex while using boric acid so your partner does not ingest the toxic acid.  If you develop a mouth yeast infection, you can combat it with medical mouthwash with antifungal capabilities. To use this medication, you swish it around in your mouth for a short time and then swallow it. The medicine helps the surface of your mouth as well as from inside your body after you swallow it. Also talk to a doctor about additional prescription oral medications that you can take. Oral antifungal medications also come in the form of tablets and lozenges.   If you have a very weakened immune system and are combating other illnesses like cancer or HIV, your doctor may also prescribe Amphotericin B, a medication that combats oral yeast infections that have become immune to antifungal medications. 

use medication on your skin.  treat a vaginal yeast infection.  ask your doctor about boric acid.  stop oral yeast infections with medical mouthwash. 

 Even if you didn't check any bags, this is how you leave the airport. If someone is picking you up, they should wait in or just outside the baggage claim. There should also be signs for ground transportation including taxis and buses, so if you plan to use one of these methods of transportation, follow signs to pick them up.  There will likely be separate lines for citizens and foreign visitors; make sure you're standing in the right one. Note that if you are traveling to the EU, you can go through the EU line if you hold an EU, Swiss, Norwegian or Icelandic passport. Have your passport and immigrations card ready to show to the immigration staff at the desks. Once you are called over to a desk, the immigration official may ask you some questions as well as check your passport. This may seem intrusive, but the immigration staff are there to protect borders from illegal entry; co-operate with them and answer questions politely. It might be a good idea to have names and addresses with you to give to the immigration official, such as the address and phone number of where you are staying and the names of any people you know.   , If you checked any bags, head to the baggage claim. Find the right belt where your luggage will be coming through once the plane is unloaded. Your flight number should be displayed above the belt where your luggage will be placed, so look for that on TV screens displayed nearby or above the belt itself. When collecting luggage from a moving conveyor belt, make sure it is your luggage you are taking off the conveyor belt, not someone else's. Look for luggage tags with your name, or personalize your bags so they're easily identifiable.  Customs officers are there to protect their communities against any illegal, dangerous or prohibited goods from entering the country.  A customs officer may call you over and ask you to open your luggage for inspection.  You should make sure you have no illegal or prohibited items either on your person or in your luggage. Smuggling is a serious offense and can land you with a heavy fine and even a long prison sentence.   Before you travel, look online to find a list of prohibited items for the country you're entering. These items will include illegal drugs, explosives or guns, prohibited foods such as agricultural products, and items from endangered animals like ivory or fur.  Find your preferred method of transportation - taxi, bus or train, or a friend who is picking you up - and depart.  

for domestic flights, once you land, follow signs to the baggage claim.  for international flights, follow signs to immigration.  collect your luggage.  go through customs.  exit the airport. 

 Make sure you practice this attitude every single day till it becomes an automatic habit for you, etched into your brain so that it'll become difficult for you to stop behaving in such a good, pleasant manner. Also, be carefree with many events that occur in your life, such as people calling you names. None of that matters when it comes to making yourself confident and happy. Remember that you should never change for other people, whether it's to impress them or simply fit in. Not only will you become fake, but you will also feel miserable rather than happy. You'll easily get tired of being the opposite of yourself.   Don't worry if acting kind and blissful feels awkward at first because it'll soon feel natural once you get used to it. By then, people should know you for your pleasant manner. Be cautious when it comes to being carefree. You should know when to be serious in certain situations; otherwise, you may unintentionally hurt others and perhaps even lose relationships that may be important to you.  For example: Be carefree when people laugh at your mistakes, but quickly lose that attitude when a friend's family member dies.  For example, you could say "Sprinkle-riffic" instead of "terrific". You could also exclaim, "Dippin' dots!" rather than use the word "Wow!" Not only will it sound cute and humorous to people, but it'll also be fun to say. Be creative when it comes to changing words to go your way, but make sure you don't turn them into bad words.   Keep in mind that some people may find you annoying when you change words like that, but never change for them. However, if you feel uncomfortable saying words as mentioned above, don't feel forced to follow this step. Do only what's comfortable for you, but don't forget to be adventurous rather than uptight and stiff. Have a little fun with yourself, but not to the point that you hurt yourself and/or others!  , Although you may believe that they don't want you to have any fun, keep in mind that they're only thinking of the best for you. Obey them while you're still under their care, and remember that they won't always be around so make good, happy memories with them. Tell yourself that they are the King and Queen, while you are the ice cream princess!  , Ice cream princesses should listen to Nightcore music while keeping in mind that it isn't evil or bad. Actually, it's known as "Hardcore Happiness." Nightcore basically consists of songs from songs that people hear today. However, the music is faster while the beat and voices are more high. Despite the fact that some ice cream princesses may enjoy it, you don't have to listen to it if you don't like it. When listening to music, make sure you choose only songs with clean lyrics. Be sure that the songs have no bad intentions hidden behind the words because ice cream princesses should be pure and not listen to any bad songs.  

have a kind and blissful (happy and joyful) attitude.  twist words to match your ice cream princess personality.  respect your parents/guardians and be kind towards them, even if you may not like what they're telling you to do.  listen to any type of music you enjoy. 

 You can do this easily if you're doing a quick coverage of gray hair and if the shade varies only slightly from your natural color. Anything more complicated should be handled at a salon.   Rub petroleum jelly around your hairline to keep the dye from staining your skin. Set your timer per the directions on the dye package. Wash the color out immediately and all at once when the timer goes off.  If you plan to visit a salon for a dye job, then do not use box dyes. They contain harsh chemicals that can damage your hair.   Deep condition your hair a couple of days before your appointment. Moisturizing your hair will help it to hold color better. Also, if you can hold off, don't shampoo on the day of your appointment.  Bring a picture. You can tell your stylist "strawberry blonde," but he or she might have a very different vision of what that means than you do. A picture clarifies what you want.    Keep your hair healthy and moisturized. Dry hair loses color quickly. Protect your hair when you head outside in the sun.Wear a hat or a scarf, or put your hair into a braid or a knot. You can also use products that contain SPF.  

do your own dye job at home.  get color at a salon.  take great care of colored hair. 

; , (30 g) of honey and 1 cup (128 g) of slightly warm water. Honey will dissolve easier in warm water than it will in cold water.   If you are slicing multiple pieces of fruit, be sure to double or triple the honey and water amounts as needed so the fruit can be completely soaked in the mixture.    Make sure that all fruit slices are completely covered with the honey and water mixture. , Your fruit slices will now appear bright and fresh-looking for up to 8 hours. 

place your sliced fruit into a medium-sized bowl.  mix together 1 tbs.  pour the honey and water mixture over the fruit.  allow the fruit slices to soak in the honey and water mixture for 30 seconds.  ,  drain the honey and water mixture from the bowl of fruit, or remove the fruit from the bowl. 

 Measuring resistance on a component in a circuit will cause inaccurate readings because the multimeter is also measuring resistance from the other components in a circuit as well as the one being tested. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to test resistance on components in circuit.  Current flowing through a circuit will cause inaccurate readings, as the increased current will create a higher resistance. Also, the additional voltage could damage the multimeter. (For this reason, testing the resistance of a battery is not advised.)   Any capacitors in a circuit being tested for resistance should be discharged before testing. Discharged capacitors may absorb charge from the multimeter's current, creating momentary fluctuations in the reading.  Diodes conduct electricity in only 1 direction; thus, reversing the position of the multimeter's probes in a circuit with diodes will cause different readings.  Some resistors or components need to be held in place to maintain contact with the multimeter's probes. Touching the resistor or the probe with your fingers can cause inaccurate readings due to your body absorbing current from the circuit. This is not a significant problem when using a low-voltage multimeter, but it can be a problem when testing resistance with a high-voltage multimeter.   One way to keep your hands off components is to attach them to a testing board, or "breadboard" when testing for resistance. You can also attach alligator clips to the multimeter probes to keep the terminals of the resistor or component in place while testing.  

test resistance on components not in a circuit.  test only components that are powered off.  check for diodes in the circuit.  watch your fingers. 

; , The first is for something that has been completed, like "ate" or "jumped". The second is more of a continual action, such as "was going" or "was eating".  You need to learn the avoir (to have) and the etre (to be) verbs really well. Take the verb manger (to eat) for example. This has an -er ending so is part of the first group.  Then add mangé on the end of those:    j'ai mangé        tu as mangé        il a mangé        nous avons mangé        vous avez mangé        ils ont mangé        , Most words with ir will conjugate to i or s, oir to u, and re to u.  Put the whole verb down, e.g. je parle (parler), take off the -er and then add ais:    je parlais        tu parlais        il parlait        nous parlions        vous parliez        ils parlaient        , 

make sure you know how to speak in present tense otherwise it'll be very difficult.  learn that there are 2 different ways of speaking past tense - passé composé and imparfait.  passé composé is relatively easy.  first, write down the conjugations of the verb avoir: j'ai, tu as, il a, nous avons, vous avez and ils ont.  for all the other verb groups this is the same with the exception of the endings.  for imparfait, it is even easier.  this is the same for all groups.  

 During summer, one of the best activities to do with friends is to go swimming. You can also swim in lakes or rivers if you live near them.   While you are swimming, play pool games like sharks and minnows or Marco Polo.Have diving or cannonball contests.  Bowling alleys are great places to hang out at any time of year with your friends. You can even create fun names for your bowling teams.  Arcades are fun places to go with your friends, as they have games for everyone.   Challenge your friends to see who can do best at each game. If you’re at an arcade where you can win tickets, pool your tickets together when you are finished playing so you can get a better prize.  Pick a movie that you all want to see.   If you can, try to go to a matinee showing of the movie. They are cheaper, and there will be fewer people in the theatre. Bring a bag with your own snacks, as movie theatre snacks can get expensive. If you want to buy snacks, share a large popcorn with your friends to make it more affordable.  It can be fun to plan in advance to attend these types of events with your friends. Look in local newspapers and online to see the schedule of events for the next few months in your city.

 Does he or she share ever detail of his or her life, no matter how mundane? Does he or she pressure you to like every single post that he or she makes? Take time to think about why your friend bothers you so much before proceeding.; , It's inadvisable to confront your friend online about issues like these, because misunderstandings could happen online. Instead, it's best to wait until you can see your friend face-to-face. If need be, you could call your friend, or send an email explaining that you want to talk, but do not give any details other than that.  Be polite yet direct. You could say: "I've enjoyed being your friend on Facebook, but I would also appreciate it if you could please stop (whatever is bothering you). (Explain why that behavior is bothering you)". For instance, if your friend is pressuring you to like every single post that he or she makes, you could say "I've enjoyed being your friend on Facebook, but I would also appreciate it if you could please stop pressuring me to like every single post that you make. I have liked several of your posts, but I have other friends on Facebook and their posts appear on my news feed, too, and I don't have time to check for your posts all day".  If the behavior continues, you could ask to see your friend again in person. This time, be a little more direct with him or her, but remain polite as usual. For example, you could say: "The last time we talked, I asked you to stop (doing whatever what is bothering you). I'm not sure why you ignored my request, but please heed it from here on forth".  If the behavior continues even more, that would be an appropriate time to unfriend the Facebook friend.  

consider what your friend is doing that bothers you so much.  wait to see your friend in person.  talk to your friend about how you feel when you see him or her in person.  take further measures if the behavior does not actually stop.  unfriend or even block the person.

 If you suspect your dog has roundworm, take him to the vet. During an exam, your vet can check to see if your dog has roundworm. The vet can screen fecal samples to check for eggs or other signs of the parasite.This is a quick test that is done without putting your dog to sleep. You should take your dog back to the vet after treating the roundworm for another fecal sample to ensure that the roundworms are gone.  If your dog has roundworms, your vet will give you a deworming pill that will get rid of the roundworm. Because the medicine won’t kill the eggs, you will have to treat the dog again in about four weeks to get any newly hatched roundworms.You can buy deworming products at pet stores or supercenters. Make sure to read the directions carefully and administer the medicine as described. Deworming medication can harm your dog if used incorrectly., The roundworm life cycle is a complex one and there are several opportunities within that life cycle for the dog to acquire infection.Dogs are at risk from roundworm eggs passed in feces. These eggs have a tough outer shell and can survive in the environment for months or even years. Thus, the feces may have been washed away by rain, but the roundworm eggs survive in the soil.Vermin that have accidentally acquired a roundworm infection can also spread them. The parasite cannot complete its life cycle in mice and rats, but the larvae can lie dormant in their bodies, ready and waiting to be activated when a dog eats them.A puppy in the womb may be infected by a migration of larvae across the placenta into his body. These larvae then lie dormant in the fetus's body tissue, ready to hatch out over his lifetime. Hence, the puppies are born already infected with roundworms.Once puppies are born, they can also be infected from larvae present in the mother's milk. 

take your dog to the vet.  treat the roundworm.  learn how a dog acquires roundworms. 

 Because the thyroid is directly related to your metabolism, hypothyroidism correlates to a slower metabolism which can lead to a feeling of fatigue and sluggishness.; , If you have been gaining weight lately for a seemingly unexplainable reason, it is possible that this is related to hypothyroidism.  When your metabolism is slowed (as it is in hypothyroidism), you cannot generate the same internal heat to keep yourself warm.  If you are noticing any of these things, especially in conjunction with other more common signs, and symptoms such as fatigue and weight gain, book an appointment with your doctor to have your thyroid tested.  For others, it can lead to unusual snoring and/or fitful sleeps with awakenings during the night (as sometimes hypothyroidism can lead to concurrent sleep apnea).  If you are having bowel movements fewer than three times per week (over a period of at least three weeks), or significantly less than your normal, consult your physician. This may or may not be related to hypothyroidism; either way, it is something that is beneficial to speak up about as your doctor can help you to manage this problem.  If you are finding it harder than normal to catch your breath walking or working out at the gym, it may be a sign of thyroid abnormalities. (If it is not hypothyroidism, unexplained shortness of breath is still a concern that should be evaluated by your physician.)  , Signs that occur less frequently (but may still be indicative of hypothyroidism) include:   Mild swelling around the eyes Menstrual irregularities in women Mild high blood pressure (this will require a doctor's evaluation) Elevated cholesterol (this will require a doctor's evaluation) Memory lossCognitive dysfunction (memory, concentration) Hoarse voice Leg swelling Slow heart rate  

evaluate your energy levels.one of the most common signs of potential hypothyroidism is fatigue, and/or a recent drop in your energy levels.  observe any recent weight changes.hypothyroidism may also cause you to gain weight, again because your metabolism is slowed down below its normal level.  notice how you feel in the cold.another potential consequence of hypothyroidism is an intolerance of cold weather, meaning that you feel less able to handle being out in the cold.  consider any changes in your skin, hair, or eyes.hypothyroidism can lead to signs such as drier, thicker skin (from the glycosaminoglycan deposits in your tissues); a lack of sweating (due to decreased metabolism); fewer, coarser hairs on your body or eyebrows; and/or brittle nails.  watch for changes in your mood or sleep habits.for some, hypothyroidism can manifest as a depressed mood.  take note of unusual constipation.hypothyroidism can also lead to constipation.  be aware of any unusual shortness of breath.sometimes hypothyroidism can cause you to be short of breath, particularly during exertion.  be on the lookout for other potential signs.hypothyroidism can manifest in a variety of different ways, and varies from person to person. 

 Look around you and find where the light is coming from. Light can come from almost anywhere — above you, behind you, around you. Where the light is coming from will make a difference in how your subject looks. For example, light coming from above your subject might cause sharp shadows, while light coming from in front of your subject can flatten the image.Move around your subject and note how changing the direction of the light changes the image. Move your subject to an area where the direction of the light creates the look you want. Certain lights will flatter your subjects, while others can create drama.; , Light can be bright, soft, harsh or low. It can take on a variety of colors depending on its source. Some lights are cool while others are warm. The quality of the light will affect how your subject looks, and can cause pictures to be too harsh, too soft, too dark, or just right., Your eyes see more details than a camera can pick up. This is why your photos often don’t match what you see. But being aware of the exposure, which is the overall brightness or darkness of a scene, will help you capture the details you want to include.If you are using a camera that has an exposure setting, a neutral or normal exposure will create the most natural-looking image., The direction of the light creates highlights and shadows. Highlights are the brightest part of an image. Conversely, a shadow is the darkest part of an image. The contrast between shadows and highlights is what makes an image interesting. Knowing how changing your light will change the contrast is the difference between taking a sub-par photo and taking one that your friends will rave about.Side-lit photos will have a lot of contrast. Front-lit photos will typically have very little contrast. Images shot on a cloudy day usually are also low in contrast, while images shot in the bright sun are generally high in contrast., Positioning your subjects so the light shines them straight on is the most common way to work with light. Changing the brightness of the light, however, can turn this common set-up into uncommon photos. Soft front lighting, for example, can be very flattering. Bright front lighting, such as a flash, can be too harsh.Flash is the most common form of front lighting. Most built-in flashes are set to flash automatically in low light. For more control, you can disable this feature and use the flash only when you want to. Sometimes, you’ll want to use it to fill in shadows when the light is bright. Other times, you might want the image to remain in shadows for a special effect, so you would not want your camera to use a flash at all. Camera flashes sometimes cause “red eye.” The best way to prevent this is to have your subject looking away from the camera. You can often remove red eye from existing photos with free photo-editing software available online.  Back-lit photos are so interesting because they are the opposite of a standard photo. In a back-lit photo, the background is illuminated while the foreground is in the dark. A solar eclipse is a good example of a back-lit photo. These can be tricky, but experimenting with different lights and different camera settings will help you learn to achieve the result you want.Silhouettes are the prime example of back-lit photos. You can create a simple one by putting the light directly behind your subject. When you shoot from the front, the subject will remain dark., To produce an eye-catching effect on your photos, use lighting from the side, which will put part of your subject in light and part in shadow. It is great for showing depth in landscape photography, as well as portraits.Side lighting will create depth, but you need to be careful not to go overboard. Too much contrast can be unflattering. Many professional photographers use a reflector or a flash to fill in the shadows and reduce the sharp edges.One of the most popular poses for portraits is to position your subject in front of a window, with one shoulder facing the camera. Different effects can be achieved by having your subjects change the direction of their heads. For one photo, ask them to look out the window. For another, have them look at you.  Diffused lighting is a soft light that can be produced by the sun shining through clouds, by the shade of trees or by light bouncing off a wall or ceiling. This soft light produces a pleasing image that captures the natural colors and details of the subject., The Golden Hour is the hour around sunrise and sunset, where the sun is near the horizon, and the light is softer. This soft light is perfect for nearly any type of photo., The weather and time of day have a major effect on the type of light you will be shooting in. It might seem counterintuitive, but overcast is good. Clouds will diffuse the light, making shadows lighter or non-existent. The shadows cast by large buildings and trees can also create the same type of diffused light found on overcast days.Many photographers think that overhead sun is the best light because everything is so bright. Unfortunately, this is often the worst time to take pictures. Colors will be washed out. If you are taking photos of people, shadows will be too dark under facial features. In addition, you are likely to see squinting eyes looking back at you through your viewfinder., During the Golden Hour, the sunlight casts off red and yellow rays. This is a great light for warm and appealing photos. If you are taking pictures of people, they will particularly like this light because warm colors flatter the skin. These colors will also make scenes appear more cheerful.Blue hours consist of the hour before sunrise and the hour after sunset, when the sun is just below the horizon. This early and late indirect light results in a light with a cool blue cast. It can create photos with a more somber mood. 

find the light source.  note the color of the light.  look for details.  look for contrasts.  use front lighting for the most certain results.  use back lighting to create dramatic photos.  use side lighting for stand-out portraits.  use diffused lighting for natural pictures.  take photos during the golden hour.  take photos on overcast or cloudy days.  be aware of light color.

For ideal taste, the shot glass should be chilled.; , of Irish cream into the shot glass. You can pour the cream over a spoon to help it drop gently into the glass, floating up to the top.

 As soon as you begin to have concerns about possible exposure to asbestos, no matter how slight, you should see your doctor. Inform the doctor about the level of your exposure, the timing, and any health problems you have experienced. It is important to be seen as early as you suspect you may have a problem.   Mesothelioma symptoms generally include breathing difficulty or pain, persistent coughing, unexplained wait loss or loss of appetite, or chest pain and heart murmurs. If you experience any of these symptoms, you should see a doctor immediately.Keep a record of any payments you need to make for these visits. You will not be able to recover amounts that are already covered by your health insurance. You should record any copayments and any payments you need to make for medications.Keep a record of all medications that are prescribed for you. Record the cost, number and type of each.; , Ask your primary care physician to refer you to an oncologist, who specializes in cancer related illnesses or diseases. If possible, ask to see someone who has specific experience with asbestos-related illnesses. You will need a detailed diagnosis to support your case.Be sure to get a copy of any doctor’s notes. Ask the doctor if he or she will be willing to testify on your behalf either at a deposition or at trial.  You should document any lost wages as a result of your illness. This includes time that you need to take to visit doctors as well as time that you lose from work because you are ill. Later on, your lawyer will be able to help you determine if some time is or is not relevant for a lawsuit. But for now, just record all of it.Keep track of dates, specific number of hours, and reasons for lost time. It would help to make some kind of spreadsheet or keep a notebook with categories.  In many cases, the loss of time in your life is as important as the illness itself. This includes time that you miss spending with your family because you may be hospitalized or bedridden. For now, don’t worry about how important any particular entry is. Just keep a complete record. Your attorney will help you sort it out as you prepare for trial and negotiations., Ask your colleagues or coworkers for references, especially if these are coworkers from the same place where you believe you came in contact with asbestos. Speak with these colleagues about their experience, and find out how satisfied they were with their attorney., Be cautious about just pulling an attorney based on advertisements. There are legal websites that offer search tools specifically for attorneys with experience in these cases. If you focus your search on legal directories, rather than advertisements, you are more likely to find better quality candidates.   You may start with the web site of the American Bar Association. From the home page, www.americanbar.org, if you select the tab “Get Legal Help,” you will be redirected to a map of the U.S. Choose your state, and you can find a directory of attorneys who can help you, arranged by topic.The legal information site Nolo.com contains a lawyer directory arranged by topic. Look for attorneys under the category of Mesothelioma-Asbestos who are near you., Finding an attorney who claims in a directory to have certain experience is not a guarantee. Try searching for stories or articles online about that attorney or his or her law firm. Chances are good that if there was a substantial settlement or legal victory, there would be some kind of story about it. You may also find other, more general information describing the attorney., If an attorney has had satisfied clients, then he or she should be able to put you in touch with some of them. Ask the clients about their satisfaction level. Ask specifically about the attorney’s level of communication, support, skill in negotiating, and their satisfaction with the outcome., Treat this meeting as a job interview. When you hire an attorney, you are hiring an employee who will work for you. You need to make sure that you get someone who will communicate with you to your satisfaction, and who can explain the law in a way that you understand it. Feel free to ask any questions that you believe are important to you. Specific things to find out include:the attorney’s opinion of your particular case (be cautious of any attorney who will guarantee victory) the attorney's or firm's experience handling prior asbestos or mesothelioma cases whether the attorney will be doing most of the work or delegate it to junior associates. In some cases, delegation is good, because it may reduce the billable rate that you pay. But you need to know who will be working on your case. the person you can contact with questions. Will you call the senior partner directly, or a junior attorney or paralegal? Again, one answer is not necessarily better than another, but you need to know.  Most mesothelioma cases are handled on a contingency fee basis, where the attorney will get paid a percentage of your eventual collection. But make sure that you understand what the percentage rate will be and when and how the attorney is to be paid. You should be able to negotiate the percentage rate. Don’t feel that you have to accept whatever percentage the attorney charges.Ask separately about payment of costs. In addition to the attorney’s fee, you are probably responsible for costs as the case goes on. This can include everything from photocopies and filing fees to travel expenses to interview witnesses and the payment of expert witness fees. Make sure you understand the likely range and how much you can control the costs. Find out, also, if you will be responsible for paying the costs as the case progresses or if they can come out of the settlement money at the end.  In most states, the statute of limitations for a personal injury claim is from one to five years, usually measured from the first diagnosis. Sometimes, a defendant may be able to argue that the statute of limitations should be measured from the first date that you should have known that you were affected. Therefore, as soon as you believe that you may be affected by mesothelioma or any other asbestos related illness, you should begin to take action., The Internet contains several sources of information regarding other asbestos awards and settlements across the country. Review these to get an understanding of the average size of awards. This will give you an idea of what you may expect. This research may also help you identify potential defendants. Some research sources that are available include the following:   pleuralmesothelioma.comlawyersandsettlements.comdrugwatch.commesothelioma.com, Your attorney will work with you to identify defendants. In general, the defendant is the person who is responsible for your injury or illness. But in an asbestos/mesothelioma case, you may have multiple options. Defendants can include your immediate employer, the manufacturer of the asbestos product in question, the owner of the building, or other individuals or companies. It is important to identify a defendant who actually has the ability to pay the amount of money that you are hoping to receive in settlement.   In one extreme example, a plaintiff filed a lawsuit and named 200 individual and corporate defendants.Most cases will not name this many, but you do want to include anyone with a connection to your illness or injury.  When you are ready, your attorney will prepare and file a complaint on your behalf. The complaint will name the defendants and make allegations that those defendants knew or should have known that exposure to asbestos would cause your illness. Whether you proceed all the way to trial or use the complaint as a basis to open settlement discussions, this is usually the first step.In some areas, as a result of prior cases that have been settled, various companies have already established what are known as asbestos settlement trusts. Your attorney can help you research these, and you may be entitled to file a claim for recovery against a trust, without actually filing a complaint in court., An experienced attorney or legal team will best know how to strategize the timing of a demand. Especially if you have multiple defendants, you need to plan carefully how you begin negotiations. Talking with one defendant is likely to affect discussions or settlements with other defendants. At some point, the negotiations will need to begin by making a demand for payment of an amount of money.Consider lost wages, pain and suffering. All the notes that you kept, early in the process, will come back to help determine your demand. Include both compensatory and punitive damages. Compensatory damages is the term for the amount of money that you need to recover in order to compensate you for lost wages and medical expenses. Punitive damages are an extra amount that courts can award as punishment. This is often where the award becomes quite high. Account for attorneys’ fees. Whether you take your case to trial or succeed in obtaining a settlement, you will need to pay your attorney. If you are paying by the hour, these fees can be quite high. Many attorneys will handle a case like this on a contingency fee basis. This means that the attorney will be paid out of your settlement or trial winnings for a percentage that you agree upon at the beginning.For example, a reasonable contingency fee may be about 30%. This means that if you recover a verdict or a settlement for one million dollars, your attorney will receive $300,000 and you will receive $700,000. If your objective is to come away with a million dollars for yourself, you would need to demand (and recover) $1,428,571.  The discovery process is a phase of trial preparation. During this time, you will investigate the possible causes of your injury and work to build a case against one or more of the defendants. At the same time, the defendants will be working to gather evidence to show that your injuries are not their fault. Discovery includes reviewing files and documents, interviewing experts, and submitting interrogatories to learn about the defendants’ trial preparation.Better discovery and trial preparation often leads to a stronger bargaining position and a higher settlement or trial award.  A settlement always requires a judgment, based on the strength of your court case. If, through consulting with your attorney, you believe that your case in court would be very strong, you can demand a higher settlement amount. On the other hand, if you and your attorney think that your court case is questionable, then you may need to accept a somewhat smaller amount., If you and the defendant agree on an amount, the next issue to consider is the method of payment. For large payments, many defendants may request to pay in installments over time. If you are going to agree to this, you may want to demand interest to compensate for the delay, or negotiate for a higher flat rate.Although it may be unpleasant to consider, depending on the severity of your case, you may need to consider dying from the asbestos poisoning. With that in mind, you should negotiate for a beneficiary to receive the remainder of your settlement payment. Otherwise, the payments could end with your death and your survivors may not collect.  The strongest bargaining position results from being able to end the negotiations and believing that you are ready to go to trial, and win. If you are desperate to settle quickly, your recovery is likely to be much smaller., In many jurisdictions across the U.S., asbestos cases have already been tried or settled. As a result, several companies have established asbestos settlement trusts through bankruptcy proceedings. These trusts exist to receive, review and pay claims for people who have suffered from asbestos poisoning. If you lived in these locations or worked for these companies, you may be able to file a claim.An experienced asbestos attorney is likely to be aware of these cases and should be able to determine if you are eligible for one or more claims. If you conduct a simple search on the Internet for "asbestos settlement trust," you are likely to find many references to pending trusts.  Settlement trusts are generally established in the name of one or more particularly employers or manufacturers. For any given trust, you will need to have a connection to that employer or manufacturer to be entitled to share in the payments. Read the details of the trust carefully to see if it applies to you., If you find a trust that you believe applies to you, read the instructions for filing a claim. You generally will need to demonstrate your own diagnosis and prove the connection to the employer or manufacturer involved. This can usually be accomplished by providing details of your work history, including when and where you came in contact with asbestos.Pay attention to the filing deadlines, if any. Because these trusts are often connected to bankruptcy cases, they do not remain open indefinitely. You will need to file a claim before a published deadline. If you find that a deadline has passed, you may still be able to submit a claim if you can prove that you should have received notice but did not. Contact the attorney or law firm identified in connection with the trust.  

begin by visiting your primary care doctor.  see a specialist.  measure your lost wages.  keep track of lost personal time.  ask for references.  use a reputable online search tool.  do additional online research of possible attorneys.  ask the attorney for references to prior clients.  interview the attorney directly.  learn about the attorney's billing system.  act quickly after a diagnosis.  research outcomes of other asbestos cases.  identify potential defendants.  file a complaint.  make an initial demand.  proceed with discovery.  review the strength of your case.  discuss payment options as part of your settlement.  be prepared to end negotiations and go to trial.  search for pending asbestos settlement trusts.  research the terms of the trust to determine your eligibility.  file a claim.

 Different vaccines generally need to be given at different times in a chicken’s life. Most vaccines are given soon after the chicks have hatched. Always talk to a veterinarian before vaccinating if you have never vaccinated a chicken before.Listed below is a general guide for the most common vaccinations and when they should be given:   E.Coli: Given at one day-old. Marek’s Disease: Given at a day-old to 3 weeks of age. Infectious Bursal Disease (Gumboro disease): Given from 10 – 28 days old. Infectious Bronchitis: Given at 16 – 20 weeks of age. Newcastle Disease: Given at 16 – 20 weeks of age. Adenovirus: Given at 16 – 20 weeks of age. Salmonellosis: Given at day old to 16 weeks of age. Coccidiosis: Given at day-old to 9 days. Infectious Laryngotracheitis: From 4 weeks of age on.; ,   Most vaccine manufacturers recommend giving vaccinations to adult birds at least 4 weeks before the hen starts laying. This ensures that the recipient is no longer shedding virus and does not therefore pose a risk of indirect transmission via the egg to birds at a different location.  Some vaccines need an annual booster shot to make sure that they are still effectively guarding against the virus they are designed to fight. Other vaccines only need to be given once and will provide lifelong protection.Vaccines that need an annual booster: Infectious Bronchitis, Newcastle Disease, Adenovirus (Egg Drop Syndrome), Salmonella.  Vaccines that do not need a booster: Marek’s Disease, Infectious Bursal Disease, Coccidiosis, Infectious Laryngotracheitis  , You do not want to vaccinate sick birds, as the virus might be too strong and may kill them. The best way to tell if you should vaccinate or not is to have a veterinarian inspect the chickens to make sure they are healthy.   At the same time, the veterinarian can talk to you about the best way to vaccinate your specific chickens.  It is very important that you check to make sure you have the right vaccine, right dosage, and understand the best way to give the chicken that vaccine. Double check you have all of the correct information and write down all of the information, including:   Vaccine name. Lot number. Manufacturer. Production date. Expiration date. Which chicken is receiving what vaccine.  If the vaccine is supposed to be stored at a specific temperature or in a specific location, it is important to check that the storage has not been compromised in any way.   If you notice any cracks, or the temperature is not at the right level, you will have to cancel the vaccination and order another round of the vaccine through your veterinarian.  The following sections in this article discuss different ways you can vaccinate your chicken. Each method can only be applied to specific kinds of vaccinations so you should always make sure you are doing the right kind of procedure. Once you have double checked that you know what you are doing, gather all of your materials so you can have them on hand when you are vaccinating the chickens.   Some vaccination methods require that you have one or two other people helping you so assemble a team if this is the case with your vaccination method.  If you are planning on using a syringe and needle to get the chicken her vaccination, you should sterilize the spot where you plan to do it. To sterilize the skin soak a cotton wool ball in surgical spirit (such as rubbing alcohol), part the feathers over the injection site and swab the skin.  

give chicks their first vaccinations at the right time.  do not give vaccines to chickens who are laying eggs.the risk of the virus being shed via the oviduct into the egg, and then taken off site where it could pose an infection risk to other birds, is too high when you vaccinate chickens while they are laying eggs.  be aware of which vaccines need to be given annually.  check the overall health of your chickens before you vaccinate.  check and record the vaccination information.  double check that the vaccine has been stored correctly.  gather all of your materials.  sterilize the spot where you plan to inject the vaccination. 

 If a shy guy really likes you, he won't make grand gestures of affection. Instead, he will show that he likes you in small, sweet ways. For instance, he might remember details about you and things that you tell him. This shows that you stand out to him and he cares about you!, If a shy guy likes you, you might catch him standing up for you. If your friends tease you or say something rude about you (even if they are joking), he might quietly say they are wrong.He might say, "I don't think Jaime acts that way." He might say, "That's not true," or "That's not how I see it."  , If a high school guy likes you, chances are his friends already know. (Maybe he told them, or maybe they can just tell.) If his friends start teasing him and giving him a hard time when you come around, it might mean that he's into you. 

watch him recall specific details.  notice him stick up for you.  hear him getting teased by his friends. 

 When you are having any kind of conflict with another person, it’s best to to avoid dealing with the problem while you are feeling angry, frustrated, or upset.You will probably not communicate well, and may just make the situation worse.   If possible, remove yourself physically from your little sister. Talk about what happened when you both feel calmer. If you can’t get away, try to keep your head. Blowing up at her will only make things worse. Take a breath and count to ten before responding.; , Instead of saying, “You are such a brat!” or or “Why won’t you leave me alone?” try telling her, “When you do that, I feel sad/hurt/disrespected/upset. It hurts my feelings. Do you like it when people hurt your feelings?” This helps your sister understand the impact of her behavior and teaches her that her actions have consequences.Using "I" language rather than blaming, criticizing, or accusing your sister will also show her that you respect her. She will be much more likely to treat you with respect in return., How is she experiencing your conflict? Even if you continue to disagree, understanding where she's coming from will help you both move toward a solution., Were you always totally rational, or did you sometimes do ridiculous or embarrassing things? Do you think you ever annoyed people? Do you remember how it felt when people you loved or looked up to were mean to you? Your sister’s brain is still developing, and she needs patience as she figures out how to interact with others. The more empathy you show her, the more she will learn, and the less annoying she will become., If you want to change her behavior, you have to understand why she acts the way she does.Although it may not always seem like it, your sister looks up to you. She wants to spend time with you, and to know that you love and respect her.If you show her that you do, your relationship with her will become much easier.   Consider the consequences of your own actions. For example, if you give your sister the silent treatment she will become desperate for your attention, which may make her even more annoying. On the other hand, if you make sure that the two of you spend a little bit of quality time together every week she will be much more likely to accept it when you say, “I’m sorry, I can’t play with you right now, I’m doing something else.”Learn to compromise. Your sister's needs may be different from yours, but objectively speaking, they are just as important as your own. You cannot always meet her demands, and sometimes her youth will mean her reactions aren't as mature as you'd prefer. If you strive to meet in the middle when possible, however, you'll eliminate considerable conflict on both sides., If your sister is getting on your last nerve, reach out to an adult for help.   Remember, people will be less inclined to help if you get personal, or if you overreact: “She’s so annoying! Make her stop!” or, “You always take her side!” Instead, focus on the problem: “She’s come into my room without knocking every day this week, and I feel like I can’t get any privacy. Could you try talking to her about it?” or, “She starts screaming every time I say no to her, and I’m having a lot of trouble handling it. Do you have any ideas?”Ask your parent or guardian for regular "alone time" to talk about life in general -- and your relationship with your little sister. Checking in on a regular basis will give your parent or guardian the knowledge they need to monitor your interactions with your little sister before they hit the crisis stage of serious irritation. Your parent or guardian should take similar time to talk with your sibling(s). 

communicate calmly.  express your feelings to your sister using "i" language.  listen to your sister's side of the story.  remember what it was like to be your sister's age.  consider your sister’s motivations.  tell a parent or caretaker what is happening. 

 This is probably one of the easiest because a lot of plants are... green! It's suitable for a St. Patrick's Day meal and for an eco-theme. This meal could consist of:   Peas, beans Broccoli Cabbage, Brussels sprouts and variants Cucumber, zucchini (courgette) Lots of other green vegetables you have available Green-dyed mashed potato, or use pesto to make the mashed potatoes green Green-dyed bread  Green eggs Meat with pesto or something similar on it Grapes, green apples  Practically anything flavored with lime Green apple juice, celery juice; , An all yellow meal would be ideal for representing a sunny day or something bright and happy. Suitable choices for the plate include:    Corn (whole kernel or corn on the cob is preferred over cream style for a more vibrant yellow) Yellow bell peppers/capsicums Squash Pineapple  Mashed potato or yellow boiled potatoes Yellow zucchini (sometimes labeled "yellow squash" at grocery stores) Pasta Scrambled eggs Yellow cheeses Practically any dessert food flavored with lemon Mountain Dew or similar fizzy drink  , Purple can be good a regal meal, and everyone can dress up as royalty. Items for the plate could include:   Eggplant (aubergine) Purple cauliflower  Purple potatoes  Purple carrots  Blueberries Boysenberries Purple dyed bread/cake (some berries will dye cake naturally) Blue/purple iced cupcakes Lavender lemonade  , Red is the color of excitement and entertainment. This would be good for a circus theme or a racing party. When making red foods, remember that beetroot juice makes an excellent edible dye. Here are some suggestions for serving a red meal:   Red bell peppers/capsicum Red quinoa or rice  Beetroot Beetroot burgers  Apples, cherries, strawberries Tomatoes or tomato sauce (for protein, you could use meat with this on it) Red dyed bread, muffins, etc. (use red fruit juice when baking) Wine for adults, red grape juice, cranberry juice  , If it's not nutritionally balanced, it's no bother because this is for a special occasion!  , Why not go the whole way and make it a color theme that includes the dining table, the meal, and the diners attending?!  

make an all-green meal.  make an all-yellow meal.  make an all-purple or blue meal.  make an all-red meal.  arrange the meal on the plate.  dress up in the same color as the meal. 

 The more comfortable you feel with yourself and your opinions, the less defensive you will feel. Oftentimes, people have trouble tolerating opinions that threaten their worldview. Being more comfortable with yourself, and how you see the world, can lead to more positive interactions with people different than you.Really consider your opinions on a variety of issues. Do some research using reputable sources rather than relying on knee-jerk responses you have. You can, for example, read a number news stories and editorials that present both sides of a topical issue before deciding how you feel. It is a good idea to learn about both sides of an issue to make sure you are well-informed. Look into an issue like immigration reform and decide your opinion for yourself. It's okay not to have opinions on certain topics, or to be drawn in two directions. Do not feel like you have to be opinionated. If you're not sure, try to accept this. For example, many people are torn on the issue of abortion. If you are not sure how you feel about this issue, you can say something like, "I honestly don't know my opinion. Sorry." Try to remember that your attitude towards yourself defines your attitude towards the world. If you feel well informed and confident, you'll be less likely to be threatened by other people's opinions and input.; , Sometimes, it can be difficult to separate how someone feels about an issue from how they feel about you. People disagree about hot button issues all the time, such as religion and politics. However, for most people, disagreements are about the issue. They are not a personal slight or attack against another person.Think about things you have strong opinions on. For example, maybe you're very in favor of universal healthcare. Do you have friends or relatives who have a different opinion? How do you feel about them? For example, your cousin may feel healthcare should remain private, while you believe in a single payer system. Chances are, you don't harbor any negative opinions about people who disagree with your perspective. Therefore, it's safe to reason those who disagree with you do not judge you as a person based on your opinion. For example, do you judge your cousin for their opinion on healthcare? Probably not, and your cousin probably does not judge you either. It's easier to be tolerant of opinions if you're able to see them objectively. Try to see someone's opinion as separate from how they judge you and your character. This will help be able to disagree with people but tolerate these disagreements. Remember that everyone is an individual who is entitled to their opinions and beliefs. Even if they differ from your opinions and beliefs, it is still important to respect that other people have different perspectives than you do.  Oftentimes, a difficult to tolerate other people's opinions is a reflection of unreasonable expectations. Do you expect everyone to get along all the time? Do you expect people to agree with you most of the time? If so, your expectations may not be realistic.Not everyone agrees on everything. Even best friends and married couples have places where their views differ. If you're surrounded by people with similar views to yours most of the time, you may sometimes accidentally assume people agree with you. However, even likeminded people do not always agree. Try to keep this in mind going into a situation. While most of your friends and family members may vote Democrat, for example, keep in mind roughly half the country disagrees. Going into new situations, do not expect people's views to align politically with your own.  How would you feel if you expressed an opinion and someone judged you? This would probably make you feel hurt. Try to follow the Golden Rule and treat others the way you wish to be treated. Just as you wouldn't want to feel judged or attacked for an opinion, do not judge or attack others.Remember, people are not their opinions. While someone may disagree on an issue that's of personal importance to you, try to pause and think about that person's perspective. Maybe they had unique experiences that formed how they feel, which may be different than your own. Whenever you feel intolerant to another person's opinion, pause and reflect on the Golden Rule. Just as you would expect someone to consider your perspective without judging you, extend this same courtesy to someone else.  When you encounter another viewpoint that is not in line with your own, you may get frustrated or upset. Therefore, it may be helpful for you to develop some coping mechanisms to make dealing with this kind of frustration easier for you. You can try including some deep breathing, yoga, or meditation in your daily routine, or get into the habit of asking yourself some questions whenever you encounter a viewpoint that upsets you. Some questions you might ask yourself include:   What is it about the topic that makes me feel so passionate about my opinion? What do I really want the others with opposing views to know about my side? What do I want them to understand and comprehend? Am I having a rational emotional response to this? Or am I bringing in prior emotional experiences that may not be relevant to this particular situation? What emotions am I feeling right now related to this topic? What are some ways I can approach my point of view in a non-threatening way and reduce the possibility of offending others?  , In some situations, changing the subject may be the best way to deal with a disagreement about a sensitive topic. You would especially want to use this strategy when dealing with a disagreement in the workplace, but you can use it in any situation.   For example, if a coworker brings up gun control and you disagree with their point of view, then you could change the subject by saying, “Yeah, that’s tough. Hey, are you going to the company picnic next weekend? Sounds like it’s going to be a fun day!” If the person persists after you have tried to change the subject, then you can kindly say something like, “I am not comfortable talking about this subject. Can we talk about something else?”  , Most people have some common ground with one another. Even someone who's vastly different from you may share certain core values. When dealing with disagreements, try to find a place where you can both agree. This can help you figure out how to smooth things over and talk out your differences in a calm, mature fashion.For example, you and a friend disagree about abortion. Try to find some common ground. While you do not agree on the moral issues surrounding abortion, think about shared values. Maybe you both agree women need access to healthcare to help carry a baby to term. Maybe you both feel people should have access to contraception to prevent unwanted pregnancies. Try to bring these issues up to find places where you agree fundamentally about supporting women and children.  When you're talking out a major disagreement, negative body language may accidentally slip in. If things get heated, you may do things like roll your eyes, sigh, or cross your arms. Negative body language will only make the other person feel hurt and frustrated. Be aware of what your body is doing and try to use attentive, respectful body language.Try to maintain eye contact when speaking and listening to show you're paying attention. Keep your facial expression relaxed as well. Avoid furrowing your brows or frowning. Aim for a neutral, relaxed facial expression. Nodding is also a good way to indicate your attention. Sit facing the person and try to avoid having obstacles between you. Sit in a reasonably close proximity to the person for talking, such as next to them on a sofa or across from them at a table. You can also lean in to indicate your interest. Maintain good posture. Don't cross your arms because this can make you seem like you are resistant to or rejecting what the other person says.  It can be hard not to personalize something. Oftentimes, when talking over disagreements, you have the urge to win an argument. Try to stay calm and look at the situation objectively. No one is trying to win. You are trying to better understand someone else's perspective.Remind yourself someone's opinion is not personal. Try to focus on the objective facts. How and why do you feel strongly about this and how does it affect you? This is what you're trying to convey. Focus on facts over feelings. For example, don't say, "It's hurtful that you don't believe in providing contraception because I rely on it." Instead, say something like, "A lot of women, myself included, do rely on contraception. That's why it's so important to me." Try to remember an emotional reaction will not help you gain insight and understanding of someone else's perspective. Even when you strongly disagree, respect the person enough to remain calm.  You should always listen to someone else's side. Do not interrupt when someone else is talking. Ask that they not interrupt when you take your turn. Truly listen to what another person says and try to understand where they're coming from while you're listening.You can also try briefly paraphrase what someone is saying to make sure you understand. For example, "So, you feel that the government is not responsible for paying for birth control?" Remember, listening to someone else does not take away from your own opinion. It is productive to understand the opinions of others. If you understand why people feel the way they do, you will find it easier to tolerate others opinions.  Look for a place where you can both agree or at least agree to disagree respectfully. Deeply held opinions sometimes do not change. However, you can at least strive for mutual respect.For example, say something like, "I see we're not going to agree on contraception. But I understand your opinion more and you understand mine more. I think this was still productive."  , If you're going into a situation where you're likely to disagree, or where hot button topics may be brought up, prepare statements that won't spark controversy. At things like work events, for example, it's often best to keep opinions on sensitive issues to yourself. Try to think of some casual comments to make instead of discussing politics.For example, you're meeting with co-workers after a recent election. The election will certainly be a topic of discussion, but try to think of more neutral things to discuss. Bring up, say, a ballot that passed without much resistance instead of a heated race for senator. Remember also that it is best to avoid talking about politics or other sensitive subjects with co-workers. You can also try directing the conversation elsewhere. You can talk about traffic on Election Day and then try to steer the conversation to a general discussion about the morning commute.  In certain places, you may want to avoid politics altogether. If you're going to a family dinner where you know you disagree with others, for example, try not to bring up heated political issues. Talk about what's going on with family members instead and leave politics out of the discussion.However, while you can try to avoid a topic like politics, remember it's okay to plainly say that you don’t want to discuss it. You can do so in a tactful way, and then change the subject if things get heated. For example, say something like, "I don't wish to talk about this topic at this time."  , Religion is another sensitive issue. At professional settings, or even family events, it's often best not to bring it up. Try to steer the conversation away from topics regarding religion, especially current events. These issues are deeply personal and people may have trouble not taking opinions as a personal slight.However, close friends and family members may disagree with you. You also may disagree with your spouse on topics like religion. You should discuss major issues with those you are close to, but remember you may not always agree. It may be important for close friends and family members to know your opinion, especially if the issue may come up. If you're an atheist, for example, it's important to let people know so they don't invite you to church or push their religion on you. You can, however, agree to disagree at times. Keep in mind that this will not be a good idea in all situations. For example, it is a good idea for your significant other to know these things about you, but a cousin or grandparent probably does not need this much information. Try to avoid the topic with anyone who you do not think will be tolerant of your views. For example, if your aunt invites you to mass on Christmas, you can say something like, "Thank you for the invitation to go to mass Aunt Lilly, but I will have to respectfully decline." There is no need for you to explain your reason and doing so may lead to conflict. Keep it simple and respectful.  

form your own opinions.  do not personalize someone else's opinion.  check your expectations.  remember the golden rule.  develop healthy coping mechanisms.  change the subject.  look for common ground.  avoid negative body language.  stay calm and objective.  listen.  try to come to a mutual understanding.  prepare non-controversial statements.  limit conversations about sensitive political issues.  refrain from discussing religion at times. 

 Chew toys help satisfy the puppy’s urges. When new teeth are putting pressure on a puppy's gums, chewing is a natural reaction. If you don't provide a chew toy, your puppy will look for something else to chew, including furniture, shoes and other things you value.   The best chew toys are made of sturdy materials. Toys made out of hard nylon, thick plastic, or durable rope are best.Good toys include KONG toys, chewing ropes, interactive puzzle toys, hard plastic bones, and teething sticks. Choose a toy that is appropriate for your dog’s size. A small breed may not be able to chew a large toy while a large breed may choke on a small toy.; , If your puppy is hesitant to chew their toys instead of your furniture, you can put a little peanut butter on the toy. A small spoonful is enough. Do not put too much on the toy, or it may keep your dog from eating more nutritious food.  Freeze a clean dishrag after dipping it in water and wringing it out. Twist the damp dishrag into a tight, rope-like shape and let it freeze that way. When your puppy starts chewing, offer the frozen rag to temporarily numb their gum pain. When the rag warms and softens, you can rinse it out and refreeze it., Toys made out of thin material or even edible products like rawhide are not recommended for puppies. You do not want to give the puppy items that they can chew to pieces. They may choke or cut themselves on the sharp edges.Some things you should avoid giving the puppy include:   Rawhide bones Cooked bones Plastic balls Stuffed animals Toys stuffed with foam  

provide your puppy with chew toys.  rub peanut butter on chew toys.  give your puppy an ice-cold rag.  avoid thin plastic or rawhide. 

 Add half of a lemon, sliced or cut in chunks, 1-2 teaspoons Old Bay seasoning, 1 minced garlic clove, and 1 teaspoon of salt. Let this mixture boil for 1 minute before adding the prawns.  Leave the tails on, and make sure they are covered in water. Simmer for approximately 3 minutes or until the prawns turn pink. Remove from heat.   You can leave the shells and head on, or remove them before cooking. Leaving them on will lead to a stronger flavor.  As soon as they come off, drain the hot water and plunge the prawns in a cold water keep them from cooking.   You can use that water as the base of a soup stock if you want to save it.  These prawns are a nice addition to a buffet table, often placed on a large platter and served with a variety of sauces, such as cocktail sauce, tartar sauce or drawn butter.   These prawns also work well in a prawn salad with a mayonnaise-based dressing, either served on a bed of greens or in a bread roll.  

boil enough water to just cover the prawns.  add the prawns and lower the heat.  plunge prawns into a bowl of ice water to stop cooking.  serve the prawns chilled. 

 Gather parsley before the first flowers start to open, and gather it in the morning after the dew has dried. It will have maximum flavor at this time of day; the heat of the afternoon will diminish the parsley's flavor. Alternately, purchase fresh parsley at a grocery store. Choose bright green bunches of parsley that look nice and smell fresh. Don't pick parsley that is shriveled, brown, moldy, or is dried out. Carefully cut the parsley with stems still attached, and be careful to not bruise the leaves.; , Use cold water to rinse, and then shake the parsley gently to remove excess water from the leaves. This will remove any residual dirt, as well as any bugs that crawled into your parsley.  Alternatively, leave the parsley sprigs whole.  Place the parsley on the top shelf, keeping it away from any foods that might drip on the parsley.  Tossing the parsley will ensure that it will dry evenly on all sides. Within 2-3 days, the parsley should be dry and will retain its bright green color.   If you dry entire stems of parsley, drying time might take up to a week., Store it in a cool, dry place.  

harvest fresh parsley from your garden.  rinse the parsley.  chop parsley into small pieces and discard stems.  place parsley pieces on a plate or tray and store in refrigerator.  gently toss the parsley every day.  transfer the dried parsley to an airtight container.

 No one can leap to the top of Mount Everest in one step. Shrink that daunting mountain into a series of more manageable goals.Write a checklist, then ask yourself what obstacles prevent you from achieving the first box.   For instance, if your goal is to become a doctor, one looming obstacle might be getting a college education. After breaking it down, your new first goal becomes filling out a college application form. Overcome your first obstacle by picking up a pen!  , Once you've listed your obstacles, take a moment to think of alternate paths to your goals. Is there any way to reach your goal while avoiding the obstacles entirely? These shortcuts don't happen often, but it's worth taking the time to brainstorm.   Talk to someone who's already attained the goal you're aiming for. She may be familiar with routes you've never heard of. For example, many companies prefer job candidates from inside the company.Maybe you can get hired at your dream company for a less competitive position, and work your way up the ladder, or transfer to a different department.  Put your plan in writing, starting with what you'll do today and ending with achieving your goal. Now recognize that your plan will change. This is just the first stage, which will set your feet on the road. As you learn, grow, and encounter new obstacles, adapt your plan to find the best path forward at each moment., As you work toward your goal, keep a journal or chart of your progress and your setbacks.Set yourself several milestones along the way, and make sure to reward yourself for each one.  Find people with similar goals, or encouraging friends. Make yourself accountable by sharing your goals and milestones. Seek advice from people with more experience than you, who may have overcome the exact same obstacles.   There are thousands of people who share your career, hobby, bad habit, or relationship struggle. Look for local organizations and online forums where you can talk about your experiences and trade advice.  Even if they aren't the obstacles you are trying to avoid, bad habits can set anyone back. Treat these as a whole new obstacle, overcoming the habit with goals and milestones just like any other.  When you get discouraged, close your eyes and picture yourself after you've overcome the obstacle. Remind yourself frequently why you're putting in the hard work and making the sacrifices. It will all be worth it when you shatter the last obstacle at your feet.  If you tend to make decisions based on gut instinct, try a more analytic approach. Here are a few possible approaches when you're trying to make a decision:   Cost-benefit analysis: Write down what you would gain from a decision, and what you would lose. Decide whether the benefits worth the drawbacks. Worst case scenario: If you attempt something and it fails completely, where do you end up? Come up with a backup plan for this scenario. Write a list of all your concerns, and treat each as a separate problem. Anxiety over a long-distance move might include finances, losing touch with friends, and your child transitioning schools. Solve each problem separately.  

break your goals into smaller chunks.  consider creative solutions.  keep an active plan.  track your progress.  seek advice and support.  break bad habits.  visualize your goal for motivation.  hone your problem-solving skills.

 Federal law sets 14 as the minimum age of employment. This means it is impossible to work under 14, except for in a few specific industries.It is possible, for example, to work under 14, if you are employed in the entertainment industry. Newspaper delivery is also exempt from federal law, but might be covered by state law., Federal regulations only allow those under 16 to work three hours on a school day and 18 hours total during a school week. Federal laws do allow you to work longer on holidays, but state laws often impose stricter regulations.   Outside of school weeks, students can work 40 hours a week, 8 hours a day. Thus, holidays are an optimal time to get a job. You are only permitted to work 7 AM to 7 PM, excluding summer time, which is defined as the period from June 1st to Labor Day. Over summer, youths can work as late as 9 PM. When state and federal laws differ, the most restrictive law applies. In general, state laws impose stiffer limitations on working hours than the federal standard. You will need to abide by these.If you are working for a business solely owned by your parents, the hour restrictions do not apply. You are still, however, forbidden from working in hazardous occupations.When working for your parents, you can work for as many hours as you want at whatever times of day you wish. However, you are still forbidden from working in hazardous conditions and the business must be solely owned by your parents., Minors are generally prohibited from working in occupations that involve explosives or heavy machinery.State law generally provides additional detail as to what type of industries minors can be employed in. Sometimes, your own real options are service sector, retail, and restaurant jobs. 

don’t bother if you are under 14.  don’t expect to work too long.  avoid hazardous jobs. 

 Patience gives us time to reflect, to slow down and think about the world and the things we're doing. It's a way of enjoying what we're experiencing rather than always rushing toward an end just to make room for the next rush. Patience allows us to enjoy the process of living. Patience also enables others to accept us into their lives through our faithful, continued presence and enduring respect for them. When we accept the importance of patience in our lives, it becomes easier to be patient with others too. Through respecting the rhythm of ourselves and others, being patient presents an opportunity to give of ourselves rather than expecting others to conform to our wants.   See How to be patient for some more general ideas on letting a little more patience into your life.; , Resist the impulse to have things the way you'd like them to be. Even a very young child can indicate their likes and dislikes; allowing these to express themselves at appropriate occasions is important. As part of asking for the child's preferences, be sure to show that you've heard the answer; aim to paraphrase the child's response so that it's clear you understand.   Resist the temptation to change the child's mind about a future occupation. If little Johnny says he wants to be a window washer when he grows up, let it be. If you constantly interrupt with something like "Oh he's just saying that. We all know he'll be a doctor when he grows up", he'll start to resent the implications of being pushed toward a designated career. Balance the wants with realities. If you think that what the child is asking for is unreasonable, unaffordable, or a sign of "consumeritis", take time to talk it through rather than simply saying no or choosing for them without discussion. You don't have to reason with the child but it helps to give a brief explanation. It helps even more if you show by example what you're asking the child to follow.  Where possible, try to please them. This isn't about being a doormat for the child's commands. It's about respecting the wants and requests of the child within the appropriateness of the situation. Help the child to learn the difference between making a request and making a demand and what the consequences are. It is also important to help them understand the importance of delayed gratification, teaching them that when you do say no, sometimes this is about waiting, rather than never having or doing what they've asked for. Helping them to understand this time perspective is far kinder than simply saying no and not explaining any further.  When the daily chores mount up and everyone is rushing about, sometimes it's easy to take one another for granted. Taking time now and then to express your gratitude for your children will help you to respect them for the unique, individual beings they are, and helps them to see the importance of valuing others openly.  Be willing to do things the child's way when possible. While their attempts might sometimes cause you frustration and worry, it is important to allow children to show you their way of doing things. If your child offers to help with making dinner, don't think of the mess they'll make. Accept that there will be a mess but realize that they're learning how to do something that will one day be of great importance as a skill (and eventually, they'll be making some of the household meals, relieving you of the burden occasionally). In watching and learning from your child or from other children, you will learn their character better, and see both their strengths and their weaknesses, giving you an opportunity to help them nurture the best talents and to learn to manage their weaknesses.   If you do not allow children to do things their way, this takes away their autonomy and potentially stunts their ability to discover things for themselves. Allow a child to try new things often, so as to give them a sense of self-trust and personal responsibility. Naturally, keep safety and propriety in mind; it is entirely appropriate to step in and change the course of a child's behavior or activities where safety or appropriateness have been compromised; this is simply part of being responsible guardians.  Remember that children have feelings, likes, dislikes, favorite foods, colors, etc. Honor these things when possible.  Children are ready to trust and soak up information from the people who care for them and spend time with them. Trying to control children lacks respect for their own self and is a way of trying to insert your way of thinking and preferences onto them. Give them space to grow into the individual that they are.   Patience allows you to be the ideal teacher. Instead of seeking to control, patience allows the child to grow at their own pace, rather than being pushed into doing things before being ready. For example, Dino de Laurentiis did not speak until he was 5. Despite the worries of others, his mother took this in her stride, believing he'd speak more than enough when he was ready. And so he did!Try this: see if you can say "yes" to the child, before you say "no". If your first instinct is to say "no", question this. Actually, why not? Are you just being controlling, or is there a good reason to deny their request?  , Most choices are not a life and death situation. Give children a rope long enough for them to safely learn on their own. Mistakes are a learning experience.   If you feel that a situation is getting out of hand with a child, take a step back and create space between you and the child. This breathing space is important for both of you, after which you can express your thoughts and establish boundaries when you are collected, rather than channeling your concerns through frustration.  Your example will be helpful to your children throughout their life. They will also have learned to make wise choices by the choices you allowed them to make. Now they will be kind to their children and teach them to make wise choices.  It can be very hard to be patient sometimes in a world where teaching Mozart in the womb and expectations of exemplary behavior from preschool are considered the norm. No matter what the competitive approach insists upon, patience gives you a means for remaining calm within yourself, to give you the perspective to recognize the readiness of a child at their own developmental pace, independent of external standards. Rushing can cause you to lose sight of your guiding role, and of the precious essence of the child.  Sometimes our greatest impatience arises when we allow our own endeavors such as work, personal pursuits, hobbies, sports, etc., to get in the way of spending time with children. Whether we're parenting, caring, teaching, working or volunteering with children, nobody is immune from impatience at times. If you feel any sense of resentment when being around children for "holding up" the things you want to do, or you find yourself "half present" instead of giving your full attention, then being patient can restore your joy of spending time with children. Let go of the impatience and realize that time spent with children is precious. It is a time during which you can learn a great deal about seeing the world through fresh eyes. It can also be a time when you realize that you can make a big difference in the life of a child by teaching or showing them something new, and by helping them to love and respect themselves all the more.   Recognize that patience is a form of kindness. Giving time is giving kindness a chance. By removing the pressure of the other "more pressing" things you feel, you show your child that there is nothing more important, nothing kinder, than spending time with them. A child who is given time with an adult soaks up the message that the busyness of adult life can wait, that childhood is a good time, and that there is no need to grow up too quickly. The point of life is being with one another, a gift that can only be imparted to a child in the doing.  

take a little time to think about the purpose and beauty of patience.  ask the child what he or she wants to have, do, or be.  show goodwill and interest in children.  be grateful for your children and for all children.  humble yourself.  remember that children are human too.  resist the temptation to control children.  pick your battles carefully.  be kind to your children and they will learn to treat you and others kindly by your example.  be kind to yourself.  love being with children.

 Kompa dancing is done in pairs, generally male and female. Many of the maneuvers in this style of dance are intimate, so be sure it is with a person you are comfortable with.; , While facing one another and standing straight, the man then places his right hand under the shoulder blade of his partner and intertwines her free hand with his own. The left arm must be at the height of the shoulders. The woman’s left hand must be placed at the top of her partner’s shoulder blade.  One of the more important steps to Kompa dancing is hip movement. Slightly bend your right knee and pick up your right foot as you move your hips toward that direction. When swaying to the right and hitting that step, simultaneously slightly bend the left knee and pick up the left foot while shifting your hips toward that direction. Doing this will help you build a rhythm.  While doing the same hip movement, move closer to your partner with the man now placing his right hand on his partner’s side, under her armpit and close to her breast. The woman places her entire left arm around her partner and places her left hand on her partner’s left shoulder blade. Doing this will create a stronger sense of guidance and direction for you and your partner.  Now that you and your partner have the hang of the first few steps, now it is time to get out of a stationary position. While doing the previous steps, move in a rhythmic pace frontward and backward. Be sure to move your leg simultaneously with your partner’s opposite leg. (If they move their left leg, move your right).  This step all depends on the chemistry your partner and you have with each other. While doing all the previously mentioned steps, add moving in a circular motion with your partner to it. 

find a partner.  grab each other and position your bodies.  sway the hips from side to side.  get closer.  move back and forth.  add a turn (optional).

 Don't think of it as "dress up." Think of it as creating new outfits that scream "you!" Play around with your clothing, trying out different items in ways you don't normally wear them. You can even put on some music and have a mini fashion show once you get some looks you like.Try some new accessories, or layer clothing you don't normally layer. Add scarves, and try tying them in creative ways. You can even tie large scarves into summer shirts! You could also try mixing and matching clothing with a sibling or a parent. Just make sure you're not doing it without their permission. Ask them before they leave the house.; , If you've got beads and things to make jewelry, haul it all out. No one's around to tell you you're making a mess or in the way. Use the internet to come up with some new designs or stick to making your own amazing creations.If you don't have beads already, you can make your own from magazines. Simply cut strips into long triangles, then roll them over a toothpick, gluing as you go. Another way to make beads is to start with a round plastic bottle with no ridges. Cut off the top and bottom, and then slit it down the side. Cut 5-inch strips of plastic in horizontal lines from the top. The width you cut is the width of the bead. Color on the strip with permanent marker in whatever design you want. Use needle-nose pliers (pliers with a skinny tip) to grab one end of the strip, and then wrap the strip around itself, creating a bead shape. Trap the other end with the needle-nose pliers, and then heat up the bead with a hair dryer on hot, turning the bead to heat the whole thing. Be careful, the bead will be hot. You can use another pair of pliers to turn it or wait until it cools. Once the bead is sealed, it's done.Just be sure to clean up the mess before your parents get home!  , If you've got glue or tape, paper, markers, and scissors, you can create an unlimited number of crafty things. Try making a card for a friend, or creating a scrapbook page with printed out photos. You could also make bookmarks or try your hand at origami.To make a simple card, fold a piece of card stock or brightly colored paper in half. Decorate the front with drawings, or cut out shapes in other colors. Glue or tape them on to create a design.  Science can be fun, especially when you use things you already have around your house. You can find any number of experiments on the internet to try at home, and you won't even realize you're learning something interesting about the world.   For instance, try making a hoop glider. You'll need an index card or some other type of stiff paper, as well as a straight straw and some tape. Cut the card into 3 pieces. Each piece should be an inch long by 5 inches long. Curl the first strip into a loop, overlapping the edges. Tape it together. Make a larger loop with the other two pieces, by overlapping the edges and taping them together. Tape the small loop on one end the straw, with the straw inside the loop. Tape the other loop on the other end, once again with the straw inside the loop. Hold the straw at the bottom with the loops up, and toss it across the room like a paper airplane.To get into the experimental mood, try other configurations. Will a stir stick work as well as a straw? What about different size loops? What if you move the hoops around on the straw? What happens?  , If you've never tried your hand at writing much, now's as good a time as any to try. If you don't know where to get started, think about some of your favorite stories. What do you like about them? Maybe the story has a great main character or the plot is really interesting and action-packed. If you know what kind of stories you like, it can help you when you start writing.For poems, try a descriptive poem. Think about a really good memory. What made it good? Use all your senses to describe the day. Also, don't be afraid to use similes or metaphors. Similes and metaphors are when you describe one thing by comparing it to something else that is seemingly different on the outside. Similes use "like" or "as," while metaphors don't. For instance, if you wanted to describe the sun, you could say, "The sun was like a giant yolk in the sky," which is a simile comparing the sun to an egg yolk. A metaphor would be "The sun was a giant yolk in the sky," since it doesn't use "like" or "as."  

create fun outfits.  make jewelry.  create crafts from paper.  create a basic science experiment.  write a story or poem. 

 Feeding your calf high quality food is the best way to prevent vitamin deficiencies. Formula that is at least 25% protein and fresh grains usually provide adequate amounts of the necessary vitamins and minerals calves need to remain healthy.  Younger calves are most susceptible to vitamin A deficiency because they have not yet built up a reserve supply of vitamins in their bodies.If your calf has a loss of appetite, rapid breathing, joint swelling, and even weight loss, it might be deficient in vitamin A. Consult a vet who treats cows and calves before starting any treatment. To correct a vitamin A deficiency, administer a shot of vitamin A or add powdered vitamins to its bottle. Grains that have gotten wet or moldy lose some of their vitamin content and might not offer enough nutrition. Replace with fresh grains immediately. Calves that are deficient in one mineral like vitamin D are often deficient in others, like vitamin E, copper, manganese, selenium, or zinc., Vitamin D helps calves absorb both calcium and phosphorus, which keeps their bones strong. A vitamin D deficiency can lead to the development of rickets.Regularly provide alfalfa that has been cured in the sun to prevent rickets in young calves.Allow the calf time outside in the sun whenever possible for additional vitamin D exposure.  If you observe your calf chewing on rocks, wood, or other similar substances, that could be a sign of calcium deficiency.Adding limestone to the grain is a simple way to increase your calf’s calcium intake.   For every ton of grain, add 40 pounds of finely ground limestone.Continue adding limestone only for as long as your calf shows signs of a calcium deficiency.  Cows get magnesium from eating grains. Calves who are bottle fed only milk or milk replacement formula without the addition of grains at the right time, can become magnesium deficient.Signs of magnesium deficiency include nervousness, irritability, and loss of appetite.To correct a magnesium deficiency, feed the calf more grains. Good choices include alfalfa, pasture grass, hay, wheat bran, soybean meal, and even legumes. 

feed your calf only high quality milk replacement formula and grains.  provide vitamin a supplements if your calf shows signs of a deficiency.  prevent vitamin d deficiency by providing alfalfa and allowing calves time in the sun daily.  add finely ground limestone to the calf’s grain to correct calcium deficiency.  observe your calf’s behavior for signs of possible magnesium deficiency.

 Make sure that it has batteries inserted. Press any key to start the unit. Enter each player’s card into the unit. Their beginning balance should be 15 million dollars., The unit is very similar to a calculator, but has some buttons and symbols you may be unfamiliar with. There are also slots on the left and right sides of the unit marked with “+” and “-.” These are where you insert a player’s card to add and subtract funds in their account. Make sure that you understand what each symbol represents before you begin playing.   Since you can only view 5 numbers on the display screen, you will need to use the denomination buttons “M” and “K,” which stand for million (M) and thousand (K). ”C” is the clear or cancel button. To restart a game, you will want to use this to adjust the balances on the player cards back to the beginning amount of $15M. You can do this by holding the “C” button until you hear a beep. The arrow button is used when a player passes “GO.” Insert their card in the left side of the unit and press this button to increase their balance by $2M. The numbers are pretty obvious, and the “.” is a decimal point, but the “.” button can also be used to adjust the volume on the banker unit.  As the game progresses, the banker is responsible for adding to and subtracting from each player’s balance using their card and the banking unit.Add money by inserting the player card in the slot on the left hand of the banker unit. This is marked with a “+” symbol. Type the amount you wish to deposit to the player’s account. Remove the card once you see the increase in the player’s balance. Subtract funds from a player’s account by inserting their card into the slot on the right side of the banker unit, which is marked with a “-“ symbol. Type in the amount the player owes the bank. Remove the card after you see the amount deducted from their balance.  When one player is purchasing something or owes money to another player, the banker will subtract from one player’s account and deposit that amount in the other player’s account.Insert the paying player’s card in the slot on the right of the banker unit. The card for the player receiving the payment should be placed in the slot on the left of the unit. Leaving both cards in place, enter the amount of the purchase. The balance which was displayed belongs to the payer. Once this balance is reduced by the purchase price, both cards can be removed from the device and returned to the players.  Auctions are held on properties not bought by the player who lands on them, or returned to the bank after bankruptcy. If a player chooses not to purchase the property they land on at purchase price, and the property is currently not owned, hold an auction to sell it at the price players are willing to pay.The starting price is set by the first player to make an offer. Issue the title deed to the player who wins the auction.  Press the arrow symbol to deposit $2 million dollars into their account., Tokens have been updated from the original monopoly board game to reflect the new age of electronic banking. Options include a space shuttle, Segway and flat screen television. Each player can choose whichever token appeals to them.  Roll to determine who goes first. Every player should roll both dice and add the amount shown on each die to total their roll. The player with the highest total starts the game.   Roll again to determine the number of spaces you move your token on the board. If you roll a double (the same number on both die), complete your turn and roll again for a second turn. If you roll another double you get another turn. If you roll three doubles in a row, though, you go to jail.  Move the number of spaces which you roll on the dice. perform the function required according to the spot where you land.Pay rent. Pay taxes. Draw a card from the community chest. Go to jail. Purchase the property.  Each time you complete a pass of the board and move beyond “Go,” you will receive $2 million dollars from the bank., When you land on the community chest, you must draw the first card in the stack and follow the directs listed on the card, then place it face down, back on the bottom of the deck.Move to the space instructed on the card in the direction indicated by the arrow. Collect $2 million dollars if you move forward past “Go,” but not if you move backward. If you draw a “Get out of jail free” card, you can sell it to another player at a price you both agree on, or save it for later.  This space allows you to complete any transactions on your turn, while not owing anything to another player or drawing a card., There are several ways you can be sent to jail. Get out of jail by paying your bond, rolling doubles, or using a “Get out of jail free” card.You can be sent to jail by landing on the “Go to jail” space, drawing a “Go to jail” card from the community chest, or rolling three sets of doubles in a row. Your turn is over once you go to jail. On your next turn, you can try 3 times to roll doubles. If you fail, you owe the bank $500 thousand dollars to get out of jail. Once you pay, move your token according to the total of your final roll. Use a “Get out of jail free” card if you have one or offer to buy one from another player. You can still collect rent while in jail. If you simply land on the jail space, you are just visiting and there is no penalty.  When you land on the space, you may choose to purchase the property at the price listed on the card. Pay that cost to the banker or the owner of the property.If you do not purchase the property, and it is not currently owned by another player, the banker will hold an auction. You can participate in the auction even though you chose not to buy it at the purchase price. Once you own all of the site properties of one color, you have a monopoly and can build on them. You can charge rent from other players who land on your property.  When you own utilities, you can charge usage fees. Players who land on your utility will owe you rent based on a dice roll. Owning both the phone and internet utilities will greatly increase your income from other players.A player who lands on your utility will owe rent determined by the amount they roll on the dice multiplied by 4, then multiplied again by 10,000. If you own both utilities, the rent owed is the player’s dice roll multiplied by 10, then 10,000.  Airports allow you to collect fees from other players. Each time a player lands on one of your airports, they will owe you the amount shown on the Title Deed card., This can be any number you negotiate together.If you have any buildings on properties of the same color, you cannot sell the property until you sell all of the buildings on that same color.  You will receive half of the purchase price listed on the deed card when you sell the house back to the bank.   You can sell on your turn or between other player’s turns. You must sell houses in even numbers the same way they were bought.  You can receive half go the deed price for the hotel or trade it in for houses equaling the same value.   For instance a hotel can be sold to the bank and you can receive 4 houses from the bank to put on that property.  You can sell sites, airports and utilities to other players to gain money. The price they pay you is any amount agreed on by both parties.Sites can’t be sold if there are buildings on any of the sites in that color group. You must first sell those properties to the bank. You cannot sell houses or hotels to other players, only the bank.  You can build your first house on a property once you own all of the site properties of one color. Buy the house according to the price on the deed card.Houses can be bought on your turn or between other player’s turns. You must build evenly and can’t add houses to one site until you have built on every site property of that color.  Once you have built houses on all of the sites of one color, you can add houses to these site properties.You must continue to build evenly across the sites in that color. No houses can be built on sites of a color where another house is mortgaged on any other site of the same color.  Once you have 4 houses on every site of a single color group, you can exchange those houses for a hotel. Return the houses to the banker and pay the title deed price for the hotel you would like to build.Only one hotel is allowed on each property site.  Once you have sold all of the buildings on a color group, you may choose to mortgage a property for money from the bank.Turn the property card upside down. This symbolizes that it has been mortgaged. The amount of the mortgage is on the back of the card. You cannot collect rent on a property when it is mortgaged.  To reinstate your property and begin collecting rent again, you must repay the mortgage to the bank plus interest.Flip the card back over once the mortgage is paid to make the property active again. The mortgage must be paid plus interest of 10% rounded up to the nearest $10,000.  Agree on a sale price with another player and sell them your mortgaged property to gain money and get out of paying interest. The interest is now the responsibility of the player who bought the property.The new owner can take over the 10% interest, or pay it right away to get the property out of mortgage status.  When the money you owe to the bank or another player reaches a higher amount than you have in your own savings and assets, you have officially gone bankrupt and are out of the game.If you owe the bank, the banker take your deeds and auctions any properties you may have had left. Return any “Get out of jail free” cards in your hand to the bottom of the community chest deck. If you end owing another player, they receive your deeds, any “Get out of jail free” cards you have, and the money left on your card.  Take over the properties and charge the other players until they go bankrupt. The last player left in the game is the winner.  

start the banker unit.  familiarize yourself with the banker unit.  add and subtract money from player accounts.  transfer money from one player’s account to another.  hold auctions.  pay players for passing “go.” each time a player passes “go,” insert their card in the left slot of the unit.  assign tokens.  roll the dice.  move tokens around the board.  collect $2 million dollars.  draw a card from the community chest.  take a break at free parking.  get out of jail.  purchase a property.  own utilities.  buy airports.  sell property to other players at an agreed upon price.  sell houses to the bank.  sell hotels to the bank.  sell property to other players.  buy the first house.  add houses to your property.  exchange houses for hotels.  mortgage a property.  repay a mortgage.  sell a mortgaged property.  go bankrupt.  survive until the end. 

 Not every night; it will dry out your hair. Washing your hair at night is suggested. If you do it in the morning, you will be forced to use heat on it, which will damage it! Showers are very important because the will make you feel fresh and clean.; , However, don't wash your face too much; it will dry up and cause acne!  Figure out what products you need for your face.

Try to have a good variety of clothes. If not spice up your look, or wash those clothes everyday .If you wear uniforms, you can wear them two days in a row, if the uniform is clean. Nobody will notice. Just spray on a pretty scent, and you're good to go.  Set your alarm clock about an hour or two before you need to leave for school. Sometimes by chance you may wake up late so get your stuff ready the night before. This means picking out your outfit the night before, putting your homework in your book bag, and putting whatever you need to bring to school at the door.  If you're a boy, use cologne. If you're a girl, use good smelling perfume. But too much cologne or perfume can be overbearing.  Have a tube of lip gloss, and some concealer in your backpack or purse. Put either a pink or tan blush on your cheeks and nose. Put a tiny bit of mascara on your eyelashes, top and bottom (only top makes the eyes appear smaller), but not too much. If you want to, use a little bit of eyeliner,make it heavier for maybe a punk, emo, or Gothic look. Make a fine line if you want to look conservative. ,, If you need new clothes, look through stores such as Forever 21, Abercrombie and Fitch, Justice (for Elementary School girls), Hollister, Urban Outfitters, American Eagle, Delias, H&M, A'Gaci, Wet Seal, Papaya, and PacSun.

 To do this, you need to:   Select the subject. Take your photograph. Without changing your position or stance, change the exposure. This can be done by changing the speed or the aperture.  What this accomplishes is changing your image and also, there will be a small amount of movement. This is what you actually want.     You can do this with 2 or more photographs. However, the more images, the less '3D' it will be. Don't let this stop you though. As long as the images align, try them out.; , You want to be sure they have the same approximate position. , Zoner will be aligning the photos.

 The goal is to show your dog that all people and pets should be engaged with calmly and respectfully.Take it to public areas, giving strangers the opportunity to pet and play with it. This is a very dominant breed and so you should take the time to socialize it early to avoid that behavior as much as possible. Socialization will help the dog develop an even temper.   This is an important part of raising an American Bulldog. Without socialization, your new dog may be suspicious of all new people and animals, which can lead to unwanted behaviors, such as biting. You can socialize your dog by taking it to public areas and allowing it to have positive experiences with new people and pets. If at a dog park, slowly introduce your dog to the other dogs and people around you while still on the leash. If your dog seems to be friendly, comfortable, and welcomes the interaction, praise it for its good behavior and gradually allow more interaction off leash and in larger areas.  If visiting a breeder to pick out a pup, there are some specific things to look for that can indicate socialization has already begun. Observe how the puppy interacts with its littermates as well as its parents. A shy, withdrawn, or overly cautious pup is probably not well socialized and has not been exposed to a lot of different situations. Well socialized pups are accustomed to many different sounds and actions going on around them and your presence shouldn’t be a big surprise. A less socialized pup may make just as good a pet as one who isn’t, it may simply require more time when training.   Remember that when you get a dog you want to avoid bad breeding situations, for example puppy mills. Not only do unethical breeders have inhumane conditions for their dogs and usually inbreed them, but they do not do the early training and socializing of their dogs that is imperative to raising a well-adjusted dog.  Each dog will develop their social skills at their own speed, so go as slow as needed. As your dog becomes more socialized and comfortable with new things, you will see that it develops an overall better temperament.   Don't forget to introduce cats, children, and anything else that you want your dog to be familiar and comfortable with as well. Take your introductions slow! When introducing your dog to a cat, don't let the animals see each other right off the bat. Keep them in separate rooms and allow them to smell each other under the closed door. After they get used to each other's smell, let them see each other from a distance. Over several days let them get closer to each other on a regular basis, all while keeping a hold of both.  Also, know that in some areas there are legal liabilities related to owning this particular breed. There have also been cases of homeowner insurance policies being denied and the breed is actually banned from ownership in some areas. Research the situation in your area before committing to this breed., American Bulldogs are a very intelligent, strong willed, and frequently stubborn breed. This can make them a challenge to train, especially for first-time dog owners. They will need to know that you are the dominant one in the relationship and training them will require a lot of dedication and patience.  It will be beneficial for you and your new pup to train with voice commands as well as hand signals. The upside to training with both of these commands is that if you are in a situation where your dog can't hear you, they can still see what you are asking them to do and can react accordingly.  Positive reinforcement goes a long way with this breed, as they enjoy pleasing their owners. Since this breed loves attention from the people that they are bonded with, ignoring your dog when they exhibit bad behavior will work better than other disciplinary measures.   When trained and socialized well, American Bulldogs have the tools they need to judge a situation and decide when everything is OK or when they may need to act on their natural guarding instincts.  During any sort of training, if you feel overwhelmed or your dog doesn't seem to be learning at a reasonable pace, consult a professional. They will be able to answer any questions or concerns you may be having about the process or techniques that you are using.Obedience schools can be a good option from the very beginning or to correct unwanted behaviors.  

socialize your american bulldog with people and other animals when it is young.  pick a puppy that is already being socialized.  socialize your dog at its own speed.  keep your american bulldog on leash when introducing it to new people, such as neighbors.  start obedience training as early as possible.  train with hand and voice commands.  use positive reinforcement with your dog.  consult a professional trainer or canine behaviorist if you are having trouble with your american bulldog. 

 If you just started the game, then take a small break and stretch. If you've been playing for a little longer than a couple hours, take some time to really limber out and consider getting something to eat, or doing anything else you haven't been able to do since you started playing. This quick break is mainly to take you out of the tightening moment of stress and give you momentary relief.; , You may have needed a moment to adjust and make yourself comfortable.  Refocus your attention from what you can't do to something you can do to keep morale up.  Sometimes it's necessary to rearrange, equip new abilities, or stock up in items that you may need in order to defeat the boss. Take the time to really go back through your menu and make sure you have everything you need. If you don't, consider buying more items to heal or help you even if you want to conserve money; it's better to be overly equipped than understocked.  Sometimes, stress can make you angry and can actually boost your gaming and encourage you to really push through certain stages of the game. If you attempt something you ignored before and prevail, it may boost up your confidence and enhance your reflexes while letting you get use to the game's controls even more. , Instead of getting really worked up and discouraged, it's best sometimes to get away from the game and find something else to do until you decide that you want to try again. Video games are centered around being fun, so the instant it becomes too overwhelming it can lose its power to be a fun thing to do and become a hassle.  All Video Game Bosses have a weakness. Try different tactics and strategies. Also, try to use the level to your advantage.  

first, consider how long you've been playing up until this point.  try going back to the boss battle and fight them again.  if you still can't beat the boss, consider leaving the area and find other things to do in the game, such as leveling up and additional side-quests that you may have missed.  if it's available in your game, check your abilities and equipment again.  try doing something within the game that you didn't do before because it was difficult.  after you've spent some time away from the boss you couldn't beat, try to go back into the battle and fight them again.  ,  if you still can't beat the boss, then consider putting down your controller for a while and walking away.  explore the boss level. 

 The high tourist season in Belize is between December and April. The highest points are around Christmas and Easter, when extra high prices are charged at resorts and hotels.  In addition to swimsuits, lightweight clothing, hats and sunglasses, you should also pack plenty of sunscreen. Consider bringing anti-diarrhea tablets and water purifiers with you, especially if you are going to go into the interior of the country.  If you are interested in seeing Belize for only a short time, you can join a cruise that departs from Texas, New Orleans, Florida or Puerto Rico and docks for a day in Belize. These cruises often visit Mexico, Honduras and Puerto Rico in addition to Belize.  Belize is known for having the second largest coral reef, so most of the activity takes place in Belize City and around the shore. Many resorts have package deals for families or couples that include meals, activities, lodging and some transportation.  If you want to spend a week or longer in Belize, you may want more freedom than a resort can offer. Choose 1 or more of the following places to visit during your stay.   Visit the coral reef. If you want to scuba dive, snorkel or hang out on the beach, you should choose destinations on the Caribbean. You can visit different Cays around the coast to gain access to different types of sea life. Visit the Mayan ruins. Belize is filled with Mayan ruins dating from AD 250 to 1000. You will need to stay in the interior of the country and do some hiking to find the best places. This can be difficult during the rainy season because of poor road conditions, so you may want to travel during the high, dry season. Go birding or wildlife watching. The interior of the country also has excellent birding, with 570 species of birds. Their large jungles contain iguanas, crocodiles and countless other forms of life. You will also need to take extra precautions in the wet season. Do adventure sports. Wind surfing, hiking, swimming, kayaking and many other outdoor pursuits can help you plan for an active vacation on the coast or further inland.  

keep your budget in mind before you book.  pack well for your trip to belize.  book a cruise that travels to belize.  book a resort package on the caribbean coast.  plan your trip according to the activities you would like to take part in. 

 The websites of most such projects will have the corresponding command line which you only need to copy-paste to your system, for instance cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/sources/classpath co classpath. The similar command usually downloads a large number of project files in a current folder.; , They may contain valuable information that will save you a lot of time.  This is not very frequent, but happens for very old projects and also for new projects that try to provide a "user friendly" build procedure. If you find such file, try to use it first (the installation may be placed in a separate script that is usually named install.sh). If you find these scripts, just run them. Otherwise, proceed to the following steps.  It is usually a .sh script that will tune the project build system to your machine. If you find it, type ./configure or sh configure to run this script. ./configure usually has a lot of options that may help if the "default" run fails with error messages. Run the script with the key --help to see the options. If there is no configure script, it may be an old - style project which only uses make files, so you can proceed directly to the next step.  If you find it, type the command make. It should find the make file in the current directory and build the project for you., In this case, type ant in the project root folder. While make is more popular for C and C++ projects, ant is popular for java projects., This uses autoconfigure, automake and libtool to create these files.  The default locations like /usr/lib or /usr/bin are usually only root-writeable, so this step usually needs administrator rights.  This usually invokes the newly compiled and installed program which is now ready to use. 

if the project has no explicit releases, you may need to pull the source code directly from its cvs or svn repository.  look into the files readme and install that should be at the top folder in the downloaded project.  some projects provide the build script as a shell script (usually named build.sh).  search for the file called configure which also must be present in a project top folder.  search for the file called makefile which may be initially present or appear after you run configure.  if there is no configure nor makefile in the project tree, it may be an ant - powered project with the build.xml file instead.  if ant doesn't work either, or the project is c or c++, try running ./autogen.sh to create the configure and makefile files.  after you succeeded to compile the makefile - based project, try make install to place the project files into appropriate locations (to install the project).  after the installation succeeds, try to type the short project name. 

 Travelers who want to be eco-aware while traveling can sometimes feel that adding yet another layer of "to-do's" is overwhelming. Yet, responsible eco-travel is not difficult and is generally about being considerate:   Travel as lightly as you can Choose transportation that minimizes your impact Stay in accommodation that aims to minimize its impact on the environment Choose vacation activities that are eco-friendly Be conscious that your small actions do add up, such as unplugging your charger when it's done Be considerate of the social impacts and support the local economy, interact appropriately with the locals and if possible, contribute to local environmental projects in some way.  There's no need to have a hair shirt mentality about eco-vacations. Eco-friendly accommodation and activities are now commonplace and often have very high standards. It's easy to find eco-travel opportunities using the internet, so you don't have to research the hard way anymore. And there is also a range of prices from budget to top end prices, so you can choose the price according to your available funds and still have a great experience.  Email and the internet make it easy to ask in advance for the qualifications or accreditation of places you want to visit and stay at. Prefer places that use the accreditation of independent auditors rather than simply stating "eco" in front of their services. Always check the labels to avoid green washing.   Check out The International Ecotourism Society at http://www.ecotourism.org/ for more information on quality assurance of your eco-vacation choices. This site provides an interactive online directory to help you.  

keep it simple.  approach planning an eco-vacation as a fun exercise.  ask for assurance of quality before you go. 

   This will help comfort her and show her you care about her during this difficult time. Hug her until she finishes crying, or until she wants to talk about it.    Don't force her to talk about anything. A good first step is to acknowledge the situation and say 'I heard your ___ died'. Using the word 'died' will let them know you are willing to talk about how they really feel; trying to sugarcoat the situation will only make it worse. Express your concern by following up with 'I'm so sorry' and kindly asking if they want to talk about their feelings. If she chokes up while she's talking, tell her that it's OK to cry, and that she can stop if it makes her uncomfortable to go on. Don't hide your feelings. Saying something like 'I don't know what to say, but I want you to know that I really care' is perfectly fine. If you feel the urge to cry, don't fight it. You may be grieving too, and crying alongside your sister will let her know you feel the same way. Ask her if there's anything you can do. This shows that you are willing to help her feel better.    If she doesn't want to talk, simply holding her hand, hugging her, or sitting next to her can show her you care. You could also comfort her by doing things like making her breakfast in bed or doing her chores.    Grieving can sometimes take a long time. Be with your sister as much as you can, and do compassionate things to help her through her loss. Sit next to her at the funeral service, or make a memorial in the backyard together. Do something to help her remember the good times when this person, pet, or plant was still alive.  

give your sister a hug.  talk about her feelings if she wants to.  don't be afraid to sit in silence and offer support in other ways.  be with her as much as you can. 

 Have a big desk with lots of easy to access file holders. Make sure you have no extra papers on your desk to make sure you don't get the papers mixed up. Right now you should have these things on your desk:   A pair of scissors  Tape A your choice color of construction paper; , Anything that you like to read is OK as long as it is yours or you have permission to do so. Place them un a stack in most likely to have things you like to least things you like. If you have no magazines or newspapers, can't cut up friends, or libraries don't trust you, then you can take pictures yourself.  Look through the entire stack of things, folding back edges of a page you think might have something that you like on it.  Go through all the pages you marked and cut out the pictures you think you might want. Be careful to cut only around the pictures, not on the pictures.  Decide which ones stay and which ones go. You will only need about 5-10 pictures depending on the size of the paper. Don't eliminate to many or you won't have enough.  Fold the corners to their original position. Tape all of the corners down to the paper. Don't tape over the picture or it won't fit. Put about an inch of tape down every corner  

clear off a desk.  get some old magazines or newspapers.  look through the material.  cut.  decide.  tape and flatten. 

 Disconnect the power from the unit.; , Remove the filter to expose the cooling coils. Additionally, some models require that the front cover or bezel be removed to allow full access to the coil. Usually the cover is secured by screws - some of which become visible only when the filter is removed.  Home Depot and many other home supply centers and hardware stores sell products expressly for this particular job. These cleaners will help remove odors from deposits of dirt, mold, mildew, cigar & cigarette smoke, etc. from the coils. Use care to see that only the coils are covered with the cleaner. Prevent foam from spraying electrical wires, controls or other parts. Foaming type cleaners will work best only when used as directed.  Clean the filter with plain water or replace if missing. A clean filter is a must. It is far easier and cheaper to remove and clean the filter every 15 hours (more or less depending of dust / dirt levels in the space) than to clean the air conditioner with a foaming cleanser. If the filter is suspected of contributing to odors, soak and wash with a small amount of scented dish soap or laundry detergent. , Set the unit to "Cool" and adjust the thermostat to coldest setting. Warm, humid air in will condense when passing over the cold coils. The condensate will rinse the dirt and foam from the coils, and collect in the drip pan. The drip pan will drain outside - but only if the air conditioner is installed properly (back tilted slightly downward to the ground).  If the air-conditioner has been neglected, it may require a second application to produce cold air and be free of odors. Wait until the coils are free from foam before re-applying. If the unit makes cool air but fails to make condensate to wash the coils, it may be due to low of humidity. In low humidity conditions, it will take longer to rinse the coils. If the unit fails to make cool air, it has likely lost the refrigerant charge or the compressor has failed. ,, The outside coils are exposed to rainwater and may not need cleaning. If unsure, or in a dusty or dirty area, it may help to clean them. Apply foaming cleaner with the unit off. Allow 10 - 15 minutes for the foaming cleanser to work., Since no condensate is formed on the outdoor coil when the unit is run, it will need to be rinsed manually. Do not force a direct a stream of water into the coils, but merely allow the foam to float away as the water is allowed to flow over the coils., Set to cooling and adjust thermostat to a low temperature. The discharge air should be cold and smell clean. If not, it is probably time for service or replacement.  Maintenance is great and recommended, but sometimes, it just can't be fixed. 

unplug the air conditioner.  remove the filter and bezel or cover of the unit if needed.  spray the front coil of the air conditioner with a cleaning agent designed for this use.  clean the filter.  replace cover and filter and restore power after about 10 - 15 minutes.  ,  run the air conditioner.  repeat if necessary.  shut the unit off and disconnect power.  ,  inspect the outdoor coils.  ,  clean the outdoor coils if desired.  rinse foaming cleanser away with garden hose.  reconnect power and test.  know when it's time to get a new one. 

  Be careful not to eat all your merchandise, too.; ,  You can throw them away, eat them with your family, or give them away as free samples. You could also donate them to a food bank or food collection if you are into helping people. Plus, then you can say that you donate food. It's a good advertising campaign.   Make sure they are arranged in a visually-pleasing way. You could have them in neat stacks, or spiraling around the jar, or if you're creative, you could use food coloring and dye the cookies complementary colors and alternate those. Also be careful of crushing the cookies.  Be sure to think about people with allergies. If you put peanut butter in all of your cookies, but don't tell the person, they could have an allergic reaction and possibly die from anaphylaxis shock.   Be willing to go a little bit lower to please a tough customer, but don't go too low or you'll eat up your profit. For example, 1 chocolate chip cookie could be $1.00, an oatmeal raisin cookie could be $1.75 or maybe a $1.50. You get the idea.  

bake the cookies, tasting one from each batch to make sure they taste like they are supposed to.  any burnt cookies should not be sold.  place a good amount of cookies in a clean, home decorated jar.  change up your inventory so returning customers have new merchandise to choose from.  set a fair price for the cookies, and stick to it. 

 You can have a spa day and make your own mask to help reduce oil production. Egg whites are a natural remedy that can soak the oil on your skin. Make the mask by mixing an egg white with a teaspoon of honey. Add a little bit of flour so you can make a paste for the mask. Place the mask on your face, or any body part that has excess oil.After 10 minutes, wash it off with warm water.  Green tea is not just tasty to drink, but it can help reduce sebum production. Using a green tea lotion on your face and body may help reduce oil, inflammation, and acne on your skin.You can also try drinking more green tea.  Eating healthy can help reduce sebum production naturally. Many vitamins and minerals can help reduce your oil production, but they need to be obtained from food sources to be helpful. You can get the nutrients you need by eating fresh vegetables and fruits and significantly reducing how much processed food you eat.Wheat, dairy, and sugar may lead to excess sebum production. Try cutting these things out of your diet to see if they help reduce the amount of oil your body produces. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish, and monounsaturated fats, found in nuts, help support skin health. An unhealthy gut can lead to excess oil production. Probiotics help promote gut health. Try including Greek yogurt, kefir, and sauerkraut into your diet.  Argan oil can help with your skin’s sebum production.Using argan oil on your skin can provide moisture that your skin needs, which can help balance your skin’s natural oil production. You can use argan oil directly on the skin or use products that contain it. 

make an egg white mask.  rub on a green tea lotion.  change your diet.  moisturize with argan oil. 

 The quickest way to start volunteering is to go to the candidate’s webpage and sign up. A lot of campaigns even allow volunteers to phone-bank remotely, so you can get started almost immediately.If primary season has passed and you don’t live in a swing state (a competitive state), then remotely phone-banking might be the only way you can actively volunteer. Don’t be the person who signs up to volunteer and gives no contact information. The campaign has to be able to contact you in order to schedule for events.  The most basic way to volunteer is simply by showing support--advertising which candidate has your support. There are several ways you can do this, including wearing a t-shirt, putting a bumper sticker on your car, putting a yard sign in your front yard, or sharing news stories, memes, and campaign ads on social media.   These are the easiest ways to volunteer, but make no mistake, they are also the least effective. Yard signs don't even move the needle by two percentage points, bumper stickers do even less, and "sharing" things on social media is mostly preaching to the choir. These things might make you feel better, but they don't do much else., If you want to help in a more hands-on way, go to a campaign office in your area. If you live in a swing state, there’s probably going to be a campaign office nearby. You should be able to locate one on the candidate’s website. If you live in a non-competitive state, there will probably only be offices there during primary season., No matter what you do for the campaign, the campaign will typically need to give you minimal training before you get started. Schedule a time to come in and get trained.Campaigns need people to convince other people to vote for them, which means that the primary volunteering needs are in door-to-door canvassing and phone-banking. There’s not too much envelope stuffing that goes on anymore.  If you want to really help with the campaign, pitch in where you’re needed. If the campaign needs people to phone-bank one week and needs people to knock on doors another week, be flexible.Although campaigns can seem chaotic, there’s a method to the madness. Local campaign staff often have directives from the higher echelons of the campaign directing them to make calls to build enthusiasm for certain events or knock on doors to get out the vote.  Volunteers can be very unreliable. They show up late, not at all, or on a completely different day than they said they would. Presidential campaigns are major undertakings--a mass movement constructed in a manner of months--reliability is key.   In fact, this is so common that campaigns have a term for it—the “flake rate.” The flake rate is about one in three in a conventional campaign, meaning that one out of three committed volunteers will not show. Just be considerate. If you won’t show, call and let someone know. 

sign up on the candidate’s webpage.  show your support.  find a campaign office.  come in for training.  work where you are needed.  don’t be a flake. 

 If you're still obsessing over the person, it might be because you just have too much time to let your mind wander. This isn't a horrible thing, but it's probably giving you too many opportunities to daydream. Pick up a new hobby by jumping into something you know makes you happy and busy, or explore something entirely new!   Consider hiking, surfing, ceramics, horseback riding, marine biology, fashion, photography, writing, gardening, roller/ice skating, modeling, crafting, biking, racing, rafting, debating, landscaping, chess, architecture, camping, writing, photography, robotics, or fencing. Anything that keeps you active will do. Don't worry about image. Do whatever excites you. Volunteer. Volunteering is important because it shows you just how much you have. It forces you to realize that your small problem — trying to stop obsessing over someone — is a very privileged problem to have.  Your friends are there to help you. Through thick and thin. They give you advice, along with a shoulder to rest on. Go out with your friends, be happy with them. Don't just sit locked up in your room, isolated from the people who want to be around you.  This is not meant in the harsh physical way. It means you should do everything to show them you don't care anymore. Sometimes, this can simply be achieved by being your normal self. Stop trying to impress them if you did so in the past. Instead, start doing the things you want to do, such as wearing clothes you actually like, doing sports you love, listening to music you like, etc.  It doesn't need to be far if that's not practical. A lot of people take time to "reinvent" themselves after a breakup, going to places like India or South America. These places are far away and expensive to travel to, so they may not be practical. But find a place that's special in your heart.   Go someplace you've never been before. As mentioned earlier, it doesn't have to be really far away or expensive to travel to. As long as you're interested in going there, traveling can be a great way to stop obsessing over someone. Talk with locals, engage in the community, and have fun. When you travel, focus on the new you. The new you is excited about learning, will put him/herself out there, and wants to have new experiences. What's the use of traveling if you don't put yourself out there?  , Don't forget: forgetting takes time. It can take as long as years to get over someone. But it does get easier. Life is never easy, but the more you understand, and the better you understand about yourself, the easier it will get. Pretty soon, you'll look back, laugh, and wonder: "What was I thinking?!"  

get a new hobby.  lean on your friends.  avenge yourself, if necessary.  go on a trip.  take your time. 

 If you like a guy, he's always on your mind--you're constantly gazing at his Facebook, you're doodling his name on your homework, you might even be dreaming about him. When you're attracted to someone, your brain has lower levels of a hormone called serotonin, which is common in people with obsessive compulsive disorder. So it's no surprise that if you like a guy, you have trouble concentrating on anything else.When you've got a crush, your brain will also release oxytocin, which can make you extra forgetful. This makes it even harder to focus on homework, sports, friends--anything other than your crush!If you can't stop thinking about him, you may also find you can't stop talking about him. If your friends call you out on always finding a way to work his name into a conversation, it may be a sign you've got a crush.  After spending time with a guy you like, you'll just want more--you suddenly can't wait to get to school every day, you change your path through the halls to pass his locker--anything just to get a little more time together. Being around him activates the reward center of your brain, and you may begin craving that experience over and over again.Though you might be craving time with him, don't let this feeling lead you to do things that might cross the line from cute to scary. Don't show up at his house uninvited or start playing hockey just because he's the goalie. Just know that if you are always excited to see him, it means you really like him.  If you notice another girl flirting with him and your blood starts to boil--why is he talking to her? does he like her? did she just touch his arm?!--your feelings of jealousy may mean you like him. But if you only notice him when he's with someone else, then you may just be feeling competitive, and be more interested in winning than actually dating him.Take your jealousy as a sign that you like this guy and don't let it go any further. If you get in another girl's face for talking to him, it makes you seem possessive and insecure.  When you're into a guy, everything he does starts to seem amazing. He's nice, funny, smart, handsome--there's nothing wrong with this guy! Experts call this the "halo effect"--because to you, he's pretty much an angel. If you think he's cute, you're probably going to think everything else about him is great, too.If you laugh at all his jokes or think everything he says is genius, or you think he's an amazing guitar player (even though he only started playing last week), it's a sign you really like him.  

consider how much time you spend thinking about him.  spend some time apart and notice if you're counting the minutes to when you'll see him again.  see how you react when he spends time with another girl.  notice if you idealize him as the perfect person. 

 Have a conversation with an unemployed friend, or one with a similarly boring job. Turn the volume on your phone off first, and be subtle. Don't stare at your phone endlessly, or your time-wasting will be obvious.; , Turn your screen away from doors and windows if possible, and mute both the computer and the game. Take some time to make your activities extra-hidden if someone does come in.   Hide your Start Bar or Dock. Right-click (or command-click) this and turn Hiding on, so no one can see what you have open. Learn the hotkeys for closing tabs, minimizing them, or switching to another program. To switch programs, try altTab on Windows or cmdTab on a Mac. Don't play games in full screen mode, as these may fail to minimize. If you're extra nervous about getting caught, take a look at these software options for camouflaging your social media sites or anonymizing your internet activity.  Visit an online game site like Kongregate, an art gallery like DeviantArt, or search for more specialized sites. It looks like you've found a site called wikiHow… perhaps the front page will have a few interesting links.   This one can be dangerous, especially if your computer screen is visible to coworkers or anyone who walks into the room. Some companies even monitor their employees' internet usage. For more "official" looking entertainment, measure your typing speed online and try to improve your Words Per Minute.  Grab a pencil or pen and make a simple drawing of anything that comes to mind. If you have artistic talent, put time into a sketch as a present for a friend.  If you're tired of phone games, educate yourself with a trivia app, or compare different organizational apps. Keep your phone muted and underneath your desk, or near a stack of papers or folder you can pull over the screen.  If your job has a lot of downtime, some employers will let you read to pass the time. If you need to be discreet about, bring a small paperback you can stuff into a drawer or coat pocket. Ebooks are another option, and there are many available for free online or in app stores.  If you have a friend in your workplace also trying to kill time, make it more interesting with a silly competition. See who can throw paper into the trash can from furthest away, or who can slip more ridiculous words into conversations without anyone noticing. Here are a few more ideas you can turn into a regular competition throughout the work week:Attach a binder clip to someone's clothing without her noticing. If you succeed, she has to pass the clip on to someone else. Play "Photo Assassin:" randomly assign each person another player as a target. When you take a photograph of your target's face, he loses the game and you take over the target he was assigned. If your workplace has office chairs, compete to see who can complete the workday without touching the office floor.  If you have a lot of spare time, origami is a hobby that takes dozens of hours to master and doesn't require much space. Start with a beginner origami book or online guide. Stiff, square paper is best, but you can cut your own squares out of regular office paper if you want to make your creations less obvious.  

text a friend.  keep your computer activities hidden.  entertain yourself online.  doodle.  find entertaining apps.  read a book.  invent games with a coworker.  learn origami. 

 Draw the person's face, with two large ovals where their eyes will be. Work loosely and give yourself plenty of space to draw.; , The top lids will droop at the edges. Add a little arch for a sad-puppy-dog effect (as shown above). The bottom lids will move upward to show tension.  Large irises will make a face look especially adorable and huggable. Draw the eyebrows close down to the eyes, with a very subtle u-shaped slant to them. Show crinkles between the two eyebrows if you want.  Give the eyes a darker color, to contrast more strongly against the tears. Add a large white highlight (oval- or bean-shaped) near the top of the eyes.  Add a darker color on top, and a lighter color on bottom. Try adding some brighter spots to make the eyes sparkle. This artist included a diagram of how the eyes were shaded, with and without the sparkles.  First, draw a wavy line across the bottom area of the eyes. This shows tears filling up the eyes. Add curved lines for tears spilling out of the eyes and over the cheeks. The curve should match the curve of the cheek.  For extra sadness, draw shadows between the bottom of the eyebrows and the top of the eyelids. Add a pinkish tone to the whites of the eyes if you wish to show eyes that are reddened from crying.  

sketch out the basics of the face.  refine the eye shape based on the eyelid position.  add irises and eyebrows.  line and color your picture.  make the eyes shine.  draw the tears.  shade your picture as desired. 

 This profile will be a useful organizing tool to reference throughout your writing process. At the beginning, it will help you determine which visual aspects of the character are important to share with readers. If you are an artist, draw a picture of your character. Provide as much detail as possible. The more details you know, the better you can pick out the unusual ones to share with readers.Don’t dress them in a generic plain t-shirt without you detailing what makes it different from every other shirt like it. Does it have any tears or old stains, indicating perhaps this is a favorite shirt? Maybe a logo or designer brand that shows their personal style or places they frequent.; , Your goal is to create a visual snapshot of an interesting person your readers want to get to know better.   Do not exhaustively detail every facet of your character’s appearance.Ask yourself, as an observer, what is the first thing you notice about this person? Does s/he have scars, tattoos, or unusual physical features (like wide, clear blue eyes) that stand out? Can you see their facial features or does a hat or pair of oversized sunglasses hide their face?  , A description that does not encourage readers’ imaginations may be accurate, but will not be interesting. Use metaphors to compare two things that are unrelated, yet share a common feature.Examples of metaphors include “blind as a bat,” “a blanket of snow,” and “a heart of gold.”   Instead of simply stating your character has green eyes, for example, describe the exact shade of green by referencing an object readers will recognize. Are they pea green, forest green, or the color of Crayola finger paint?Avoid clichés and aim for original comparisons. Clichés like “she is lovely as a rose” are so common that readers instantly recognize them without having to think about what they mean. This statement fails to say anything important about the woman since beauty is a subjective judgment. Be specific and use your imagination., List their talents, strengths and weaknesses, moral beliefs, likes and dislikes, and any other personal information you have considered. Readers don't need all of this information, but you need to know your character in and out to make decisions about what to present.   Think about how they see themselves and how others would perceive them. Do these images match or clash? Do their dreams for the future match their talents and strengths? You want your reader to leave with an impression of who your character is as a person, not just what they look like.,   Are their clothes neatly pressed and tailored, indicating attention to their appearance, or do they look like they rolled out of bed and threw on whatever was nearest on the floor.Note anything that is absent that one would normally expect. Are they walking in the snow without a coat or shoes, or fully dressed head-to-toe in 100 degree weather?, Describing how your character interacts with his or her environment gives you a chance to offer insight into their intellect and conscious indirectly, so that your writing becomes a story and not just a biographical sketch.Be specific and concrete. If surfing the web, what type of sites are they looking at? If walking, are they taking large, confident strides or shuffling their feet?Even if s/he is doing "nothing," this fact provides insight into their personality and thoughts., When little direct action is taking place, recording the character's thoughts or conversations keeps the reader engaged.When using dialogue, note the speaker’s tone or inflection, any pauses or tics, or unusual words choices. Do they gesture while they speak or use meaningful body language? Are they saying what they really think or hiding their true nature?, Make their physical attributes active, as well. A long skirt might graze the floor, their hair may fly around wildly. Maybe their coffee cup sits motionless and loses its warmth because they are too preoccupied to drink., Their surroundings should suggest something significant about their personality or state of mind. Your description should also set-up the scene for what is about to happen.   If at their home, details concerning the location, size and condition of structure, how it is decorated, and your character’s housekeeping skills can offer clues as to their personality or habits. If your setting is a public space, like a coffee shop, tell readers whether the shop is a well-known chain, or a dive that few people even know about. Reveal if they sit in the back rather than in view of other patrons.  Tell your audience what the character sees. feels, smells, or hears to make it more realistic and engaging.Don’t just tell your audience that your character is drinking coffee, give details about the type of coffee: straight espresso, a syrupy latte, or plain black Columbian coffee. Describe the scents in the shop, the noise from the drink machines, and the people chatting at tables nearby. Can they hear a dog barking outside? Is the sun permeating the window, forcing them to wear sunglasses?  , This is a great way to develop your character's personality.   Explain how they got there: were they trying out a new place on their own, meeting someone for the first time, or are they really bad at reading directions? Describe what exactly about the scene makes them uncomfortable. 

start creating a character profile.  focus on your character’s unique attributes and/or personal quirks.  use creative descriptors instead of simple adjectives.  expand on your character profile to include personality traits.  connect clothing and personal objects to the character’s personality.  make him or her an active participant.  include stream of consciousness and/or dialogue.  don’t limit active verbs to a character’s movement.  offer a visual sketch of the character’s immediate surroundings.  appeal to your reader’s senses.  consider placing them in an uncomfortable environment. 

 Well, everyone knows that Bill hates fans dressing like him- so to prove you're a real fan of his, don't! It's a very simple rule. But sometimes you like some styles that could be the same as him not because you're trying to copy him. That's fine (e.g. Criss Angel, Adam Lambert and Andy Sixx, Black Veil Brides); , Do not believe anyone you see on any of the above sites (or any you can think of) claiming to be Bill (or any of the other members). They have said several times in interviews that they do not have personal sites, or even MSN, so delete anyone who claims to be them- they are lying! However, the band does have an official Facebook page.  He has the Tokio Hotel logo on the back of his neck (he got it when he was 15), he has the star tattoo on his abdomen (he got that when he was 16) and he also has 'Freheiht 89' for his 18th birthday (as a present to himself). It represents his freedom, and how is now free to do all of things he couldn't do before, due to laws. He has also gotten a tattoo up his left side saying "Wir werden nie aufhören zu schreien. Wir zurück zu den Wurzeln." In English it means "We will never stop screaming. We are going back to the roots/origins." His newest tattoos are both on his hand. One tattoo says "0630". It's a twin tattoo, and it matches Tom's tattoo. It represents the time of his birth, 06:30. His other hand tattoo covers his entire hand, as a skeleton hand. It also features a yellow flower and a bird. According to Bill, it represents "life and death, power and strength, Beauty and perishability, love and bond, equality and distinctions."  , He has his right eyebrow, his tongue pierced, his left nipple pierced, snake bites, a septum piercing, three lobe piercings on his right ear and one lobe piercing on his left.  September 1st, 1989. (same as his twin brother Tom).He likes the letters R and S the most.  So you know they don't eat meat anymore (see interview here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFpg3_IqYkc)  ,,, Bill now has a faux-hawk type hair style, and he is now platinum blonde. Bill changes his style and his look often.  

be unique.  know that he does not have a myspace/facebook!,  know his tattoos.  know his piercings.  know his birthday.  in a recent interview, bill and tom admitted that they are vegetarian.  he's allergic to wasps, mosquitoes and apples.  ,he would love to have children in 5-10 years  ,  don't judge him when he changes his style. 

 An easy way to keep Velcro from becoming clogged with dust, pet hair, and other airborne debris is by keeping the strips fastened as much as possible. After removing shoes, clothing, or bags with Velcro closures, re-fasten the closures until the next use. You should also keep Velcro fastened when washing garments.; , Another way to decrease the amount of dust that forms on Velcro fasteners is by spraying them occasionally with an antistatic spray. This reduces the static charge of the Velcro, which will discourage it from attracting dust.  The rougher side of the fastener containing the small hooks tends to get clogged more easily with dirt and hair. A simple way to clean this side is by running another hooked Velcro fastener against it a few times. This tends to lift the debris to the surface of the 2 fasteners, where it can be gently lifted away by hand.  If you can't find a spare piece of Velcro to use for cleaning, you can try using a small knitting and crocheting tool called a crochet hook. Drag the crochet hook through the hooked fastener of the Velcro, and the small groove in the hook will drag hair and dust along with it.  If you still cannot remove some of the debris from the hooked side of the Velcro, you can try pinching and removing the offending material using tweezers.  If the softer, looped side of the Velcro is soiled, you can clean it using duct tape. Wrap a length of tape around your hand, securing it using its own adhesive. Blot the tape gently against the Velcro several times, lifting the dust and debris away.  Velcro can be washed using a mild soap and warm water if desired. This will clean dust out of the fasteners, as well as helping to remove any odors that may be lingering on the Velcro. You can wash the Velcro in your sink using dish soap and allow it to air dry afterwards.  

keep the velcro fastened when not in use.  spray the velcro with an antistatic spray.  clean the hooked side of velcro fasteners using another piece of velcro.  use a crochet hook to clean velcro fasteners.  use tweezers to remove stubborn debris.  blot the looped side of the fastener with duct tape.  wash the velcro fasteners with soap and water. 

 The more information you have regarding your child’s native culture, the better equipped you will be to answer their questions and share insightful information. Information resources available online and at your local library are invaluable in helping you and your adopted child connect with their native culture. These resources include books (including photographic books), documentaries, websites, and videos online.Visit your local library and talk to the librarian about borrowing some resources regarding your child’s native culture. For instance, if your child was born in Estonia, rent books and DVDs about Estonia from your local library, and type “Estonia culture and history” into your preferred search engine.; , Showing your adopted child that you value and respect their native culture will make them happy and inspire them to do the same. For instance, if your child’s native culture is that of India, explain to your child, “One of the world’s greatest leaders, Mahatma Gandhi, is from India.”Ask your child if they have knowledge of the religious traditions of their native culture. For instance, if your adopted child is from India, you could ask, “Do you know that in India, cows are revered as sacred animals?” Share inventions of your adopted child’s native culture with them. For instance, if your adopted child was born to Mexican parents, you could say, “Chocolate and popcorn are native inventions of Mexico.”  , Maintaining an open and positive relationship with your children about their cultural and ethnic background is a great way for them to adapt successfully to the duality of being born in one culture and raised by another. Explore, learn, and celebrate with your children their birth culture’s traditions, values, norms, and beliefs. Make an effort to incorporate their birth culture's celebrated holidays and traditions into your own. These techniques will help you and your children as they get older and are learning to develop their own self-identity., If your child is the only adopted child from a particular native culture in their school, they might feel out of place and isolated. If possible, enroll your child in a school that has a more racially diverse student body.Even if a school does not have students of the same racial background as your adopted child, a more diverse student body will allow your adopted child to have a range of friends who might be better-equipped to share and understand feelings and thoughts about racism or discrimination., Different cultures have different holidays. Check online for a list of holidays celebrated by your adopted child’s ancestors, or talk to others familiar with the holidays of your child’s native culture. Identify holidays unique to that culture and celebrate them with your adopted child.For instance, if your adopted child is from Korea, you might celebrate Chuseok, a holiday often translated as “Korean Thanksgiving,” by making foods traditionally associated with the holiday like songpyeon, a type of rice cake.  Your adopted children may feel more comfortable and at home when they see that there are various elements related to their culture in their environment. Hang artwork, or bring in other home decor related to your children’s birth culture. Bring in music, movies, and culturally-specific foods for dinner. Explore these items with your children to help them feel the comforts of home in a safe and fun environment., Your child might take pride in sharing the history and culture of their ancestral land at their school during international culture celebrations. Your child might be interested in sharing information about their native culture at these events in the form of a brief presentation (accompanied by video or images), a performance of dance or music from their native culture, or by cooking and sharing food from their native culture.Direct your adopted child to tell their friends about their native culture. Direct your adopted child to write about their native culture for homework assignments.  

educate yourself about your child’s native culture.  share interesting information about your child’s native culture with them.  make it an open and celebrated topic.  enroll your child in a racially diverse school.  celebrate holidays of your adopted child’s native culture.  bring in cultural elements within the home.  encourage your child to share their heritage. 

 These features can be divided in four different categories. Strengths and Weaknesses are internal factors; Opportunities and Threats are external factors. Create 2x2 matrix and write down the features. There are a lot of resources how to properly identify these factors. Every factor in each category could be an answer to different questions. For instance:   For Strengths: In which areas your company has competitive advantage? For Weakness: Are there any areas inside your company which limit growth? For Opportunity: In which areas your target market can be identified as friendly? For Threats: Is there any external situation which can cause any trouble?; , Remember, as the Pareto Rule states: roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. For instance: when you identified ten weaknesses, select 2 to 5 which you think are most important in your current situation.  Easiest way is to assign score for each feature and sort them accordingly to assigned score. Higher score means greater importance of previously selected feature.   Choose whatever scale you need, but the easiest method is to assign scores between 1-100. Make sure that the total score of all features in given category is equal to 100.  Relations define whether some internal feature has influence on external one. For each category and for each pair of features from these categories answer:   Strengths and Opportunities: Whether given strength strengthen given opportunity? Strengths and Threats: Whether given strength overcomes given threat? Weaknesses and Opportunities: Whether given weakness limits use of given opportunity? Weaknesses and Threats: Whether given weakness intensifies impact of given threat?  , Collect answers from previous step. For each pair of categories (Strengths and Opportunities, Strengths and Threats and so on...) calculate total score. The easiest algorithm is just mathematical sum.   Add score of left-hand feature (strength) to score of right-hand feature (opportunity) for all pairs which has relation identified as existing (for instance: Yes, this strength overcomes this threat); all pairs which has non-existing relation are counted as 0. Sum up all added up scores and get final results for each pair of categories.  Compare scores, each score represents suggested strategy for your current situation:   If Strengths and Opportunities has the biggest score, your strategy should be Aggressive If Strengths and Threats has the biggest score, your strategy should be Diversification. If Weaknesses and Opportunities has the biggest score, your strategy should be Turnaround. If Weaknesses and Threats has the biggest score, your strategy should be Defensive.  For example: for defensive strategy identify most dangerous weakness (Note: it should not be necessarily one with biggest score assigned by you in previous steps - that is the point of relation step) and try to limit it.   Create goals for your company and execute some actions which would limiting this weakness. Then get back to your analysis in a month or so, update it and check if features from previous SWOT still exist and latest strategy recommendation is still valid.  

identify features (factors) which exist in internal and external environment of your company.  for each category, go over the identified features and select those which are important to you.  for each category create ranking of features.  identify relations between features.  now do the math.  now you should have four subtotal scores: one for strengths and opportunities, one for strengths and threats and so on.  identify which features have the biggest impact of given strategy and work on them. 

 If you are just wanting to get out of town, visiting the great outdoors may be the perfect way to do it. Many state and national parks have camping areas, and some even have cabins and lodges to stay in, all at a reasonable price.

 Rental scammers will usually offer properties at a rate below the average in a neighborhood. They will do this to lure you into what you may think is a good deal. When this happens, a scammer will ask for a rental deposit and various other fees up front. To combat this tool, always check the average rental rate in the neighborhood you are looking to rent in. If a property is being offered well below the average, consider that it may be a scam.   A number of websites offer statistics about average rental rates.; , Scammers will often claim they are working on behalf of other individuals that are absent for various reasons. They may claim the landlord or owner is sick, overseas, or busy. If you see this sort of story, you should immediately be concerned. When you rent property, you will be interacting with the landlord or property owner regularly, so you should never rent from someone who is too busy to interact with their tenants.   These scams will usually be followed up with a request for first and last months rent, as well as a security deposit. If you pay them, they will avoid you and run with your money., If you are the landlord or homeowner, scammers will try to reach you as well. Oftentimes, people will contact you and ask for personal information and tell you they are looking to purchase or rent your home. Their offers will usually be lucrative and well above the actual market price. In addition, a lot of these emails will be very informal and will include poor spelling and grammar.For example, a scammer may claim to want to buy your home for millions of dollars on behalf of someone overseas. However, in order to complete the purchase, you will need to send them your personal information so they can wire you the money. They may ask for your name, bank account information, address, and phone number.  Some scammers will alter valid advertisements by changing the email address or other contact information associated with it. They will then take the advertisement and place it on a different site. In this scenario, when you go to look up the property information, it will actually be for rent. However, instead of contacting the true landlord, you will instead contact the scammer.These rental scams can be difficult to recognize and avoid. However, one sure way of protecting yourself is to always request an in-person meeting with the landlord. In addition, ask for access to the home or apartment so you can view the property. While true landlords will meet in person and offer you access, scammers will not. While they may meet you, they will not have access to the home.  Scammers will try to lure you in with tragic stories appealing to your heart. You will often see advertisements claiming there are family issues or financial hardships that require them to rent the property.If you see one of these ads, ignore it all together. Professional landlords or property owners will never allow their personal lives to seep into their professional work.  Before you make any payment, research the property you are looking to rent. If it is local, visit the property and have a look around. Be suspicious if the property is occupied with no sign of anyone moving out (e.g., "For Rent" signs). If you are trying to rent a property in a different state or country, hire a reputable broker to check out the property for you. While this will cost you extra money, it will help you avoid scams.   In addition, conduct online searches for the property in question. Look for other advertisements with different contact names and numbers. This could be a sign of a scam. Also, make sure the address is real to begin with. A lot of scammers will make up property addresses altogether.  During your pre-rental process, you should always take the opportunity to meet with the landlord or individual responsible for managing the property. If you are working with a large and reputable management company, you will usually have nothing to worry about. However, if you are dealing with small organizations or with an individual, check public records to verify they are the true owner of the property in question., If you still have questions about the advertisements you are looking at or the individuals you are dealing with, take online quizzes that will help you gauge the legitimacy of your concerns. Quizzes will ask you to answer a number of questions and will then provide their opinion as whether the advertisement may be a scam. For example, rentvine will ask you the following questions:Does the price seem low for the neighborhood? If yes, it might be a scam. Have you checked Google Street View and do the pictures in the ads match? If no, it might be a scam. Is a free email account being used by the landlord (e.g., gmail, yahoo, or hotmail)? If yes, it might be a scam. Is the rental listed elsewhere with different photos or contact information? If yes, it might be a scam. Does the owner claim to have an elevated title (e.g., reverend, doctor, or missionary)? If yes, it might be a scam. Does the owner's name match the public records? If no, it might be a scam. Is the rental description poorly formatted? If yes, it might be a scam. Do the photos seem off (e.g., is there a photo of a ski lodge when the rental location is said to be in Miami). If yes, it might be a scam.  Never pay a deposit or rent without meeting your landlord first. A lot of scams will ask you to wire money online or send a check through Western Union. They will try to convince you that they are out of the country and that they need your deposit or rent money urgently. In return, they claim they will send you the keys in the mail.If you are being pressured to send money to someone you have never met, ignore their requests. Wiring money is like sending cash. Once you complete the transaction, you cannot recoup the money., Cash is difficult to trace and recover, which is why it is such a sought after form of payment for scammers. Whenever it comes time to pay a deposit or rent, always require they accept a check. When you pay with a check, you will be able to trace its whereabouts, which includes when and where it was cashed. If you do fall victim of a scam, law enforcement will have a better chance of recovering your money and finding who was responsible., If you have not been able to verify the identity of a renter, never pass along personal or sensitive information. Scammers will usually ask for information they can use to steal your identity or to help gain access to your finances. For example, some scammers may request your Social Security number or your credit reports. This information should never be sent until you are one-hundred percent sure about their motives.   In addition, never hand over your current address, account numbers, routing numbers, or any other information that could be used against you.  The best way to avoid scams is to hire a reputable broker. Brokers will know which companies are legitimate and what properties are actually available. In addition, you can always verify that a broker is legitimate because they are required to be licensed by your state.   Some brokers will also offer insurance and will repay you for any losses if you you are the victim of a scam., Individuals who perpetrate these scams are committing federal and state crimes. Most often, these individuals can be prosecuted for federal wire fraud, which is a fraud using interstate electronic communications (e.g., emails and instant messages).Contact your local police department or visit in-person. They will be able to start a report and investigate the potential crime. This should be the first thing you do. It is important to include law enforcement at the earliest stages so they have the best chance at finding the scammer.  The FTC is a federal agency tasked with preventing various forms of unfair business practices and fraud. One of their tasks is to receive complaints of rental scams and report them to various law enforcement agencies.   To start the process, visit the FTC complaint website., From the complaint website, choose the category you want to file a complaint under. With rental scams, there is not specific category for you. Therefore, click on the category for "scams and rip-offs." Then, because there is no subcategory touching on rental scams, click on the link for "no match found.", The FTC website will start an interactive process where you can answer various questions regarding the scam. In general, you will provide the following:How you were contacted (e.g., by email) Details of your complaint, including whether you were asked to pay any money and whether you did pay any money Details about the person or organization that contacted you Your personal information Any additional comments you may have  , After you answer all of the required questions, you will review your complaint and click "submit." You will receive an email verifying the fact you submitted a complaint. The FTC will review your information and contact you if they need anything else.  If you paid someone money and did not receive access to the property you were promised, you need to contact the source of the advertisement.Not only will they want to know their site or publication is being used to commit scams, they may have an insurance policy or guarantee that will allow you to recoup your losses.   Most reputable websites or listing papers will have a phone number or email address you can use to contact them. If they do, use that information. If they do not have any contact information, consider not using them at all. However, if you have, include the website or publication name in your FTC report.  

look into common rental rates.  recognize absent landlords.  beware of personal inquiries.  check for altered advertisements.  avoid sob stories.  research addresses.  verify the landlord's identity.  take a rental scam quiz.  ignore requests to wire or send money.  avoid paying in cash.  disregard inquiries for your personal information.  use a reputable broker.  report the scam to your local law enforcement agency.  visit the ftc website.  choose a complaint category.  answer the required questions.  submit your report.  contact the website or publication where the advertisement was posted. 

 To stop periods for around 2-3 months, you can get an injection called Depo-Provera. This is an injected that you receive on a regular basis from your GP.   There are surgical options available to permanently stop periods. These include a hysterectomy, the removal of the womb, and endometrial ablation, the removal of the endometrial lining of the uterus. These surgeries can be dangerous and can make pregnancy complicated or impossible, so consult a doctor before deciding to undergo surgical options.  Exercise is vitally important in general, and being physically fit will make your periods shorter and lighter. This is a great way shorten your period in a way that's sustainable and even beneficial over a long time.  Birth control pills often call for 21 days of contraceptive pills followed by a week of placebo pills. You will get your period during that one week. Hormonal contraceptives are a safe and effective way to regulate your menstruation, especially for those who suffer painful or excessively heavy periods.   If you need to skip a period, you can do so by simply skipping the placebo pills and continuing with the actual contraceptives. This can have unpredictable or unpleasant side effects, so consult your doctor before doing so. Oral contraceptives are available by prescription only. Discuss your needs with your doctor before and during your time on the pill.  

discuss a long-term option with your doctor.  get fit.  use birth control. 

 Drugstores have a good supply of foundation, but what they don’t offer is a way to try on the product. Foundation needs to match your skin perfectly, so it’s important that you try it on at a store that offers tester strips, like MAC or Sephora.Look for foundations with built-in sun protection, so you don’t have to apply yours separately. If you have to shop at a drugstore, look for a foundation in a neutral tone. Avoid anything with overtones of other colors (yellow, peach, pink, copper, etc). If you have bad skin, splurge on the best foundation you can afford. The higher quality will help even out your skin tone without aggravating your acne.  The biggest mistake people make when shopping for lipstick is only considering color. Choosing a lipstick that works with the color of your skin is important, but it’s not the only factor that counts.Walk around the store and see how the color holds up over time. Consider how easy or difficult the lipstick is to apply. If it’s hard to apply, you won’t wear it often. Think about if the lipstick feels good on your lips. If it’s too dry, it won’t be comfortable. For a natural lipstick color, choose a color that either matches or is slightly darker than your natural lip shade.  Concealer is meant to conceal small areas, not to be used as an all-over foundation. If you’re just evening out a few small blemishes, look for a concealer with light coverage.If you have dry skin, steer clear of liquid concealers. If you have oily skin or enlarged pores, avoid stick concealers. For dark circles, select a concealer with at least medium coverage.  Different types of lashes require different treatments, so it’s important to match your mascara with your needs. If you have very straight lashes, you’ll also need to invest in an eyelash curler.If your lashes are short, look for a mascara with a lengthening formula. If you have dry eyes, use a mascara with a wax-based formula. Skip the waterproof mascara – it’s harder to remove.  

buy your foundation at a specialty store.  choose a lipstick that looks and feels good.  pick your concealer based on what you’re concealing.  shop for a mascara that works with your lashes. 

 Vinegar is known for getting stubborn odors out of things – shoes included. When washing your shoes with soap and water, add a bit of vinegar to the mixture. After washing your shoes, you can also rub them down with pure white vinegar and a rag. The vinegar smell will fade, but the smelly odor will be completely eliminated., Baking soda is a great deodorizer, so it's one of the best ways to get smelly odors out of shoes. Pour 2-3 tablespoons into each shoe, and shake the shoes so that the baking powder spreads out evenly. Let the shoes sit overnight, and then pour the excess baking powder out of your shoes., Dryer sheets are great for giving clothing a fresh scent, and they're also great for freshening up smelly used shoes. Place 2 dryer sheets in each shoe and leave them there for a few days. Remove the dryer sheets before you put your shoes on. This should greatly improve the scent of your used shoes.   You can place dryer sheets in all types of shoes, but this method is particularly recommended for dress shoes that cannot be soaked in vinegar. 

use vinegar to deodorize your shoes.  use baking soda to deodorize your shoes.  put dryer sheets in your dress shoes. 

 How we feel inside is expressed in our eyes and on our faces.Learning to recognize the association between facial expressions and certain types of emotion goes a long way in being able to read emotion.   Don’t be fooled! People can manipulate their facial expressions to appear to look happy when they are angry or sad – actors do this convincingly all the time. Look for other cues as to how they really feel. Note her body language or tone of voice. Make eye contact – open, penetrating “cold” eyes suggests a different emotional state than a “warm” smile.  A genuine smile uses more muscles than one that is faked or forced. The corners of her mouth and cheeks should be raised. If the muscles around her eyes also tighten and “crow’s feet” form (clusters of wrinkles around the outer corners of eyes), then it is a good indicator of a genuine smile.  This might seem obvious, but people try to control or cover-up their true emotions by smiling when they are sad. Genuine and spontaneous emotions are hard to fake.Sadness is associated with frowning (lowering the corners of the mouth). It is also associated with raising the inner corners of the eyebrows (near the noise). Additional cues are loose, drooping eyelids that cover part of the eye.  Anger and disgust are often associated with one another and create similar facial expressions.We wrinkle our noses when we are disgusted, angry, or annoyed.   Anger and resentment can be towards someone or about something.When we are angry, we pull our eyebrows down, purse our lips (tighten them and suck-in the margins), and bulge our eyes. In contrast to anger, expressing dislike, disgust, or disdain for someone or something is associated with a raised upper lip and loose lower lip. We also pull our eyebrows down, but not as much as when we are angry.  While fear is a negative and surprise is considered a positive emotion, both activate the sympathetic nervous system and trigger a “fight or flight” response.When something unexpected happens, whether it is good or bad, it stimulates a part of the brain that is outside of our direct control. When this happens, we pull up our eyebrows and eyelids so our eyes are wide open.When we are afraid, we also pull our eyebrows in (towards the nose), our pupils dilate (get bigger) to take in more light, and our mouth is open. We also tense up the muscles in our face, especially around our mouth and cheek. When we are surprised, we tend to arch our eyebrows and drop our jaw. Our mouth is open, and the muscles around it are relaxed and loose. 

take note of her facial expressions.  recognize a genuine smile.  distinguish sadness from happiness.  recognize anger and disgust.  recognize fear and surprise. 

 Close iPhoto when it opens up.; , This app detects when you connect a camera (or camera-containing device, such as your iPhone) to your Mac. At the bottom of the window will be a box with your device name. If the box isn't visible, click the little triangle at the bottom left.  Phone opens:". This tells your system to no longer open iPhoto as soon as your phone is connected.  When your phone is connected again, iPhoto will no longer open automatically.  

connect your iphone to your computer.  open your applications folder and launch the "image capture" app.  select the "no application" option from the menu under the phrase "connecting ...  quit image capture. 

 Self hand massage is also a great stress reliever. Place some lotion or even a teaspoon of olive oil on the palm of one hand.; , Repeat with the other hand. Turn one hand over and massage from the wrist to the fingertips, gently pulling on them as you finish. Use a circular motion, and then repeat with the other hand.  

massage your hands to increase blood circulation to the skin and make it softer.  rub the palms together and then use the thumb of the opposite hand to massage the palm in a circular motion while keeping your fingers interlaced. 

 A break is how far the fold or crease at the bottom of your pants in the middle of the leg comes down on your shoe. No break means that the bottom of your pants only slightly touch the top of your shoes, if it touches at all. This look is great for a trendy, modern style, and it also works well on slim and short people., A slight break means that the front of the pants covers a small part of the top of the shoes. This is a good choice if you want to stay up-to-date, but aren’t into trends. A slight break works for pretty much everyone., A medium break comes down a little bit lower than a slight break. This type of break will cover about a ½” (1.3 cm) of your shoe. This look is ideal for someone with a conservative style. A medium break is also good for someone who wants to wear dress pants with a cuff., A full break comes down the farthest on your shoe. A full break covers about an inch (2.5 cm) of your shoe. This look is considered to be a bit out of style, but it works for someone who is going for a vintage look or is heavier set. The pants should be fairly wide in the calf or ankle for a full break to look right. 

choose no break if you want to be trendy.  wear a slight break for a contemporary look.  choose a medium break for a conservative style.  wear a full break for a vintage style. 

 If you're teaching a group, you will have to talk much louder than if you were teaching just a couple children. Make sure not to strain your voice (look up tips for saving your voice), but most importantly keep your commands and instructions short and to the point. The video provides more information on voice techniques.   In this example, which would be more effective? A. "Okay class, I want everyone to pay attention and listen closely to my directions." B. "Oy!" The answer is "example B." "Oy" means "attention" and is precisely 13 less words than "example A."; , An example structure could be moving in closer to the student that is not paying attention, putting a hand on their shoulder, and giving them a "look" of disapproval.  If you're teaching freestyle side breathing, for example, avoid saying: "Okay, I want you to start turning your head as your pulling hand passes under your body. Then take your breath and start returning your face back into the water as your dominant hand recovers and you begin recovering your other arm." Instead, say, "Breathe, stroke one, stroke two." Wasn't that easy, precise, and to the point? And in just 5 words you communicate your message to the entire group.  Give each student a number or a color. For example, go to each child and say, "red group," next child "blue group," next child, "red," next child, "blue, etc." Since every other child is in an opposite group, you have maximized your space. In large groups, you may even want to go with three groups. In order to maximize practice time, have one group go, and then when that group is 1/2 to 2/3 of the way to the rope or wall, have the other group go. This way you are maximizing practice time and eliminating as much down time as possible.  Nothing is more important than safety and practice time. By using a flotation device (preferably a progressive one), you can increase practice time and keep your beginners safer.  Most swim instructors make the mistake of doing all the talking which is a huge mistake when teaching group lessons from both a learning and behavior standpoint. Instead, give yourself and your students an "edge" be engaging them in the process. For example, let's say that you want to teach your students the cues/buzzwords for the back kick. Simply state, "say what I say" or "repeat after me:" "Ears in the water," they repeat, "Tummies up," they repeat, "Small, fast kicks," they repeat. Not only are they learning but by involving them in your presentation, you eliminate many behavior issues.  

use your voice effectively.  use proximity, touch, and facial expressions to communicate.  use "buzzwords" and cues instead of long-winded instructions.  maximize practice space and practice time.  use a flotation vest for beginners.  use choral responding techniques. 

 You can choose both winter shoes and summer shoes as your wardrobe evolves through the spring.  Summer is the time to enjoy your sandals and espadrilles. Just be sure to enjoy them without socks.  You can still be somewhat flexible as your wardrobe transitions to winter, but avoid the sandals and espadrilles. They don't match with the heavier fabrics and colors of autumn.  Choose loafers, flats and boots. Make sure that your heels are wider to avoid slippage.  

be flexible in the spring.  lighten up in summer.  pull back in the fall.  choose practical shoes for winter. 

 Once you have found your chick, you won’t want to leave its sight. You will probably need a small box and a helper.  Though they are small, it’s not too hard to find out where they have gotten to.  Chicks can be just as fast as fully-grown quails so make sure you are quick.   Be gentle and do not squeeze the quail chick, this will harm them and cause them injury.  Make sure the box has breathing holes and that the chick cannot escape from it.  Whether the housing is a brooder or with the mother hen, it’s important to put the chick back where it belongs.  The chick should be able to get through the wiring on the pet carrier whilst a fully-grown quail shouldn't.  You will probably need a helper and a large book.  Do not put any other chicks in the pet carrier as they will escape.  Go to the area you last saw them and look around. If you cannot find the quail try looking in your neighbour’s back yard (with permission). Quail chicks can be fast and they might have travelled a long distance by now, depending on the time they escaped.  The mother quail will most likely call to the chick and persuade the chick to get inside the pet carrier.  The chick should be trapped with its mother.  A good place to take them is indoors, in a brooder or a cage, but before you take them to the brooder/cage make sure that it is secure and that the chick cannot escape any more.  

be prepared.  find out where the quail chicks are.  once you have found the chick, try catching it with your hands.  place the chick in a small box.  put the chick back in its home.  obtain a pet carrier.  be prepared.  put the mother quail of the chick inside the pet carrier.  find the chick.  place the pet carrier (with the mother quail inside) near the chick.  block the entrance/exit of the pet carrier with a large book.  take the chick and its mother to a safe place. 

 You just cannot market to a market that you do not know. You have to get to know your market as if it were a person. What motivates that “person? to buy your product? How old is the average person buying from you? What gender are they? Where do they live? What kinds of jobs do they have and what is their income? The more you know about your market, the more you are able to target your message effectively.; ,, You can have a great marketing message, but your market will not be interested if it does not reach them at the right time. Think about certain times of the year that your product or service can be advertised aggressively. Holidays such as Christmas, Fourth of July, and Easter could be exploited to increase revenue for your business.  In direct response marketing, the experts say that only 20% of your results are based on your creativity. Then, 40% is dependent on your offer, and the last 40% is dependent on your list. With this in mind, you have to test your offers. You have to find the right offer that will beat all your other offers, and then turn around and test it again. You need to test, and then test again. In addition, after it is all done and over with, you need to start all over again, with your testing. In this way, you will be testing and refining your results for the better on a continual basis.  Your message will resonate with their hearts. It will address their needs and your service or product will differentiate you from your competitors. Be sure that you stress benefits over features. All too often, advertisers are hung up on the features, and leave prospects wondering what the benefits are. Do not assume that your prospect will already know the benefits. You have to spell them out for the market.  

know your consumer.  target your message to the appropriate audience.  ,  time your message appropriately.  have the right offer.  use your knowledge of your market to create a message that hits them in the core. 

 Pay close attention to their likes and dislikes. Look for opportunities to talk with them about what they are doing or playing with. Spot the ways that they can improve their play by simple changes that they can make themselves. These changes can be as easy as adding a book for a toy car ramp or where to place their feet as they learn how to pedal their bikes.  Your child will learn that his or her opinion is important to you. Following through with his or her suggestions helps the child's healthy internally nourished self-esteem to grow (rather than the ineffective externally imposed boosterism). It is then your job to encourage your child's suggestions and to make him or her a very valuable asset to the task at hand.   Say things like: “I’m so glad that you thought of putting the bread in this basket. This will make dinner so much easier.“  , It is much easier for children and for that matter, anyone to identify and want to help with things that they care about and are familiar with. Even if it sometimes means that you may have to go back and “really clean” the areas that you have asked them to be in charge of, passing on the expectations of responsibility for one's own things is worth the extra effort.   When they are finished with their meal, be sure to encourage them to put their dishes in an appropriate place––the sink or the dishwasher depending on your family. If you want them to clean their rooms, begin with reachable goals, like asking them where the books go and then let them follow by putting them away. The goal is to show them that you entrust them with small independent decision making when it comes to their own belongings. This tip can extend into personal hygiene also. Help in the house can begin from as young as 3. Small tasks at first, then increase the challenges as the child grows older.  

observe your children at play and in everyday life.  request your child's input and advice on small tasks.  include your children in everyday household chores that involve their own stuff. 

 Research the rear end crash ratings of different cars. Cars that have superior crash ratings are better able to prevent whiplash if you are ever involved in a car accident.; , The headrest should sit directly behind your head while you are driving. Proper headrest position will prevent your head from being jerked in an unnatural position and reduce strain from being tossed back and forth. A properly adjusted headrest will be as close as possible to the back of your head as you can comfortably stand. The headrest should reach the top of your ears.  Consistent seat belt use can help prevent you from suffering from whiplash if you are in a car accident. Seat belts help keep you safe upon impact by reducing jarring and strain and can keep you from becoming a flying projectile if your car is ever hit.  Defensive driving can lower the chances of you becoming a car crash victim. According to statistics there are over 125,000 whiplash injuries per year from car accidents.  

purchase a safe and reliable car.  adjust the headrest in your vehicle.  wear a seat belt.  drive cautiously and safely. 

 Use a large, canvas, water resistant backpack with several compartments and padded shoulder straps. A waist strap will help distribute weight and make the bag easier to carry long distances. Since you won't use this daily, you can buy an inexpensive one from a discount store, military surplus store, dollar store, or even from a local thrift store. Think function over fashion.   Add a luggage tag with your name and contact information to your bag. If possible, add some form of identification inside your bag such as an old employee ID. You may have left behind your handbag.; , Water is heavy to carry but you will need to have plenty available. You'll also need high calorie snacks. Keep at least one sealed bottle of water in your bag and pack more if you can stand the weight. Make sure it's in a durable container so you can refill it and close it easily.   Pack granola bars, S.O.S. bars, or protein bars that are high in calories and carbohydrates and store well long term. Food is not only necessary for energy, it can be great for morale. Dried fruit is also an excellent option.  Peanut butter (assuming you're not allergic to peanuts) comes in handy tubes, is an excellent source of protein, and does not require refrigeration or cooking.  Blackouts have shut down many cities, forcing people to walk miles. Cell service can be spotty or nonexistent. Subways can be down and vehicles backed up because of non-working traffic lights. Think ahead! Make a plan! Visit a fabric or athletic store or look online for reflective tape. Buy 1–3 yards (0.9–2.7 m) as you will add it to your backpack and other items if necessary. It's usually sold in rolls and is 1" wide or wider.   Add the reflective tape to the exterior of your backpack. Use fabric glue to attach it if you don't sew. Attach the reflective tape to the back of the bag and the front straps. Be generous with the tape. It may make you visible to drivers or emergency workers.  Choose a coat or poncho made of brightly-colored material, such as yellow, so you'll stand out more. This can protect you from the elements on a long walk, provide shelter, and, when covered in the reflective tape, make you stand out to drivers and other people. You should add reflective tape to your raincoat since wearing it may cover the tape on your backpack.   Pack the folded poncho in your backpack. If it doesn't fold into itself (as many do), you can compress it into a small bag to keep it out of your way. You can also wrap thick rubber hair bands to compress it. Those will also come in handy to keep long hair out of the way during the emergency. (Hair in the eyes can obstruct vision in addition to being frustrating.)  , You can buy Mylar sheets (so-called space blankets) at hardware or camping supply stores. They are large, lightweight, waterproof and exceptionally thin. They come tightly packed, about the size of an ace bandage, and should be left in their original packaging until you need to use them because they're pretty tricky to refold once you reopen them. Because Mylar reflects heat, it can be used to retain body heat in extreme cold or to reflect away heat in extremely hot conditions.  A whistle will make more noise with less effort than yelling if you become trapped. The higher pitch will also carry better than your voice.  In case of an emergency, you may have to run or walk long distances in unpredictable conditions. You don't want to do that in heels or stiff leather work shoes. Your safety may depend on moving quickly and traveling efficiently on foot. Athletic shoes are an absolute must in every person's grab-and-go work kit. Don't use a new pair, as these can cause blisters; pack a pair that is broken in but not worn out, if possible. Even a worn pair is better than wingtips or heels.   Many athletic shoes have reflective trims but you can add more. You should still have some tape left over from the poncho and backpack.  Pack cotton crew athletic socks that are appropriate for your athletic shoes in terms of thickness. Avoid low cut socks, as they don't protect your heels when walking long distances. Stuff the socks into the shoes so as to conserve space and keep your footgear together.   Women who wear skirts and dresses may benefit from packing knee high athletic socks to provide additional coverage for the legs.  For the kit, use a quart or gallon size zipping storage bag. Label your bag. You can even add a piece of the reflective tape to make it easier to find if you drop it or are looking for it in a dark pack. Include the following items:   Adhesive bandages: A few of each size will do. Pack mostly the 1" since they work well for blisters. Bandages that are foam instead of fabric offer more protection for blisters and can still be used for other first aid. Antibiotic first aid ointment. Benadryl or other antihistamine: emergencies are not a good time to have an allergic reaction. Epi-pen if you have been given one by your doctor for severe allergies. They're usually willing to write prescriptions for several so you can keep several available. Prescription medication to last a day or two in a well-labeled container. If your medication changes, you need to update your kit. Be very specific when labeling describe the pill bottle, the dose, and what it treats. Don't forget an asthma inhaler if you are an asthmatic. You may be walking and air quality could be questionable. Pain killers, such as aspirin. Look in the travel/trial size section of stores for small bottles. An ace bandage, which is great for rolled ankles or can be used to immobilize a limb. Latex or vinyl gloves (if you are allergic to latex) are a must. You could be around injured people or need to treat someone with your first aid kit. Anti-bacterial hand gel for cleaning up. Washcloth or hand towel: can be used for clean up, wiping a sweaty brow or signaling. Find a travel/trial size of saline solution (or contact lens wetting solution) and include it in your kit. Flushing eyes may be necessary for contact lens wearers or for anyone in dusty or polluted air. It can also be used to irrigate a wound. Assorted gauze or other first aid items. You can use additional quart or gallon size plastic storage bags to keep items dry and organized.  Find at least a small or medium flashlight or headlight and make sure it has fresh batteries. Maglite type flashlights are extremely durable but heavier aluminum flashlights. The larger ones can be used as a defensive weapon should you need it. Decide if you can tolerate the weight and have room. You can go full size (D cell) if you have room and can stand the weight. You won't get a warning on a massive power outage or evacuation.   Look for a small to medium light that takes AA or C batteries. It depends on how much space you have, your needs and how much weight you can tolerate. Lightweight plastic flashlights are great. You don't need to spend a lot but make sure it works. There are many newer, pocket-sized LED flashlights on the market that are less expensive (check discount), more durable (no bulbs to burn out or break), and produce more light per set of batteries.  It should include streets and public transportation (subway stop) information. You may be forced to detour, disembark a train early, or take an alternate route -- finding yourself in unfamiliar territory. Always keep a map to find the best way to your destination. Getting lost can add insult to injury. Traffic patterns are often changed and you may find yourself walking through unknown areas. Keep a map with you of the city and note different routes to take out.  Cell phone service may be down or your phone charge may not last. Consider keeping the numbers of friends or family near work, in between work and home, and someone who could pick you up and offer shelter. Keep the numbers stashed in your kit. Phone traffic may be heavy and connections hard to come by, so don't rely on calling information first. Your memory of numbers may also be strained in a stressful situation, so keep things written down.  You can get one from your local hardware or paint store and add it to your kit. They only cost a few dollars. If you need one, you really need one. Smoke and debris can be choking during a fire or earthquake. A particle mask can be very helpful.  There are solar and wind-up chargers available. Others often use a few small batteries and convert the power to give your phone a small charge. Check travel sites, mobile phone supply stores, or airport kiosks.  Stash cash for public phones, food vending, or any thing else that could come up. Don't keep too much, just a few dollars and quarters. You can often hide it under the sturdy cardboard bottom. You can use this for transportation or to buy food or drink. Don't forget to include several quarters should you need to use a public phone and be able to find one.  It may provide dual use in case the restroom facilities lack proper supplies. Think of the different things you may encounter on the way home. Every city and its facilities are different.  Multipurpose tools are available at most sporting goods or camping stores. The one shown here has pliers, which can be very handy. There are too many ways to use one of these to begin to list them all.  Many local radio stations switch to emergency programming during an emergency. Look for a small, battery operated FM transistor radio for your bag. These can be found in discount stores or electronic stores for minimal investment. All local radio stations will begin emergency broadcasting if there is an emergency in your area. Make sure it has fresh batteries and is turned off before adding it to your bag.  If you leave a house key, don't add anything to identify it as such. Even better, hang a combination lockbox from your home door (if allowed;) with a spare key in it. These are $30 at a hardware store and also come in handy anytime you or a family member accidentally lock yourself out or if you need to call a neighbor to enter your home when you are away, and you won't need to risk losing a spare stored elsewhere.   An additional advantage is that if you don't carry a spare key in your emergency kit, you can put your address on a luggage/ID tag attached to it. A spare car key could also be helpful depending on your situation (or in a magnetic wheel-well box - these really work!).  

choose the right bag.  pack enough food and water.  pack reflective tape.  pack a compact raincoat or poncho.  pack a space blanket.  pack a whistle.  pack a pair of athletic shoes.  pack socks.  pack a small first aid kit.  pack a small flashlight.  pack a map of your city.  pack a list of emergency contact numbers.  pack a face mask.  pack a portable charging unit for your phone.  pack some cash -- but not too much.  pack a small pack of tissues and moist wipes.  add a all purpose pocket tool or swiss army knife.  pack a small radio.  tape an extra house key into the bottom of the bag underneath the cardboard bottom. 

 You can find moss liners at most craft stores. Throw it over your table for an instant fairy transformation. It's the perfect base for little fairy hideouts and other decorations. If that's out of your budget, try lining the table with a green tablecloth or green paper., Lace is reminiscent of fairy wings and the fairies' whimsical world. Therefore, it makes the perfect solution to place mats for your party. Just use a doily big enough to act as a place mat for each setting, or use a series of doilies or a lace runner in the middle of the table., Once you've created the base, add woodland touches here and there. Butterflies, ladybugs, flowers, toadstools, tiny fairy houses, and even gnomes make great decorations for a fairy party. Of course, don't forget to add some fairies!, Glitter makes an excellent "fairy" dust to sprinkle around the room for a party. Add some to the middle of the table, for instance, to create some sparkle. Just keep in mind that glitter can be difficult to clean up, so be prepared to spend some extra time on cleanup., Bamboo can add a whimsical touch to the party. Fairies wouldn't use plastic utensils. They'd make they're own utensils from leaves or bamboo, so incorporate that into your decorations by using bamboo. Of course, green plastic utensils would also work fine., You've transformed your table; now it's time to transform your chairs. Start by covering the stools in red fabric. You can use simple cotton fabric from your local craft store. Next, add white felt dots with a glue gun. Cut the fabric into appropriate sizes, and pull it tight over the seat of the chair, stapling it underneath the seat of the chair. You can also use white fabric paint to add white dots, but you should do that before you put the fabric on your chair, as you could damage the fabric underneath if you don't.  

try a moss liner.  add a touch of lace.  create a woodland wonderland.  sprinkle some fairy dust around.  use bamboo utensils.  turn chairs into toadstools. 

 You need to win her back.; , She loves knowing that you took time out of your day to think of her and write down your feelings. She loves having something tangible that she can always refer back to when she wants to remind herself that she is special to you  , I know a lot of times it is hard for a guy to truly admit he was wrong. BUT you need to, she'll respect you for it.  Draw her a little picture, write a poem, whatever. It doesn't have to be perfect, if you can't draw then make an effort, she'll appreciate the fact that you tried for her.  It's harder to work with someone who hasn't cooled off yet. Give her a few hours to let off some steam.  Your apology will mean more if she hears it from your voice. If you have no guts, send her an email or MSN her. Make sure you make it sound meaningful.  Take her flowers, if she is into that type of thing and sincerely apologize.  This will mean a lot to her, and she will probably forgive you.  Some girls can really hold a grudge, but you have to use their own weaknesses against them. If they love bears, take them a stuffed one. If they love music, sing them a song.  Tell her how much she means to you.  

don't be pushy, if she is mad at you, don't try to force her to speak to you.  write her a letter, girls love letters for a number of reasons.  in your letter, apologize.  make her smile.  give her a bit of time.  if you have the guts, the most meaningful thing to do is call her.  to really make an impact, go see her.  promise never to do what you did to make her angry.  if she doesn't accept at first, give her more time and keep trying to apologize.  show her that you care, and apologize from your heart. 

 If you do Pilates in a small, carpeted area, you may be able to get a thinner, narrower mat. If you have more space or a harder floor surface, get a thicker, wider mat.; , The purpose of the Pilates mat is to help support and cushion your body as you do exercises on it, so it is important not to get a mat that is too thin.  Measure your height and body width to check against a mat's dimensions at the store or when reading product details online. If possible, lie down on the mat to see how it accommodates your body.  Touch the mat if you can to see how it feels and whether it will provide you with a good grip. Find a mat that will prevent you from slipping or sliding as you exercise and may perspire.  This may be important if you do Pilates at a gym or other location where you need to bring your own equipment or simply want to put away your mat after exercising. Consider getting a mat that can be rolled up or carried by a strap.  The extra thickness can give you more support and protection against potential injuries. You may want to have a mat made of foam underneath a thin mat.  Certain mats may be manufactured and marketed for either Pilates or yoga, but you can try using a combination of both types in your Pilates workouts.  This may be an option if you are taking classes at a Pilates studio that provides equipment for their students. By using different mats, if offered, you can decide which ones you prefer. 

examine your workout space and floor surface.  get a mat that is at least 1/2-inch (1.25 cm) thick.  buy a mat that is long and wide enough for your body.  judge the mat's texture.  find a mat that can be easily transported or stored away if necessary.  consider using 2 mats.  include yoga mats in your selection process.  try out pilates mats in a studio.  choose a mat's color and/or pattern based on your personal preferences.  

 Your park needs to be at level 14 or higher before trying to breed this dragon.; , A seasonal dragon can result from a variety of combinations containing the elements of air, fire and plant. Some suggestions for possible combinations include:   Blazing dragon with a plant dragon Firework dragon with a plant dragon Flower dragon with an air dragon Poison dragon with an air dragon  , The egg color will be a swirl of red, blue, purple and green.   Breeding time can be hastened by spending gems. , To help it grow, feed it the same food as all baby dragons.  

go to your breeding cave or the epic breeding island.  pair two compatible dragons.  wait 48 hours for breeding.  put the egg into nursery and wait another 48 hours until it hatches.  ,  place the seasonal dragon in a seasonal habitat. 

 Don’t worry about organization. Just open your heart and let it spill. Even if it sounds weird on paper, you can always change it later.; , Just like in English class, writing a great letter that will make her smile requires a process.  Let her know that you find her special and that you would like a chance to get to know her better.  Similes such as, “Your eyes are like a deep blue ocean” or “Your smile is like a sunrise that welcomes a wonderful day” are ideas of how to make your letter stand out. Don’t overdo it, but a little spice in the soup will get her attention.  If she’s interested, this will get her excited. , You just want to let her know how you feel.  

make a list of the things that you like about her.  begin organizing your feelings into a letter.  be honest with your feelings.  use some romantic style in your letter.  tell her you want to talk and would like to meet somewhere.avoid copying love quotes found online, as these usually end up sounding artificial.  thank her for taking the time to read the letter and let her know that if she doesn’t feel the same that it’s okay. 

 A well fitting girth on a new saddle will be slightly longer than when the saddle is broken in as the billets stretch. You need to use a girth that fastens with the girth buckles just below the appropriate position during the break in period (one or two holes below the middle billet hole on both near and far side).; , New leathers are rough on saddle flaps that are not yet broken in to accommodate them.  Wait for a day of steady rain. Not a downpour, and light mist won't do the trick. It's best to buy your saddle in the summer when the temperatures are such that you will be able to completely break in the saddle with one ride.  Do not wear a raincoat that covers any portion of the saddle.  During this ride, pay very close attention to your equitation, in particular your leg position and seat. It is helpful to have a friend who watches you and corrects ANY deviation. Start with your stirrups adjusted into the position you most commonly ride in. Shorten or lengthen your stirrups into the other lengths you use once your saddle is thoroughly saturated. Ride equal time in all positions after the saddle is softened by the rain.  The billets stretch most during the first ride.  Seal the exposed leather with a coat of glycerin. Dip a bar of glycerin into water and use a dry cloth to pick up a patch of it. There should be NO bubbles! Coat the top of the saddle fairly thickly and turn over. BE SURE THAT YOU ARE USING PURE GLYCERIN. Many soaps contain basic (high pH) additives that will damage the leather; leather is naturally slightly acidic due to the tanning process.  Use warm neatsfoot oil on the lower flaps (those in contact with the horse), taking care not to oil the side in contact with the horse. Do not oil any stitching. Oil in extremely thin coats, using a soft cloth or sponge. Repeat until the oil does not soak into the leather, then wipe off any excess and allow to set for at least 24 hours. Oil will soak into the leather over time, and may accept more oil after setting. DO NOT OVER OIL THE LEATHER. If it is over-oiled, it will become too soft and delicate, which will decrease the life of the leather. It is not recommended to oil soft leather at any point, including, in some cases, the knee rolls, blocks, and often the seat of the saddle. It is possible, if desired, to lightly oil the smooth side of hard leather on the skirt and upper flaps. Oiling the smooth side takes far longer, but it makes it easier to control the evenness and amount of oil used.  Alternatively, it is possible to lightly oil the billets, following the same instructions as those for the saddle flaps and skirt.  The leather should be darker, softer and shinier than when new.  Continue to closely monitor your leg placement during the first few weeks of service. Check your girth very frequently and use a shorter one when billets stretch and the buckles get too high on them.  

make sure your girth fits.  it is best to break in a saddle with an older set of well maintained stirrup leathers.  do not ride in your saddle the day you bring it home.  tack up your horse being very careful to have your girth adjusted and the buckle of your stirrup leathers pulled up to the stirrup bar.  ride as usual for at least an hour.  check your girth frequently!,  when you have completed the ride.  lightly treat the underside of the saddle as above.  you can work the billets with a glycerin wash. knead the glycerin in until they become more pliable.  buff the top leather with a soft flannel cloth.  allow the saddle to sit for 2 to 3 days before putting into use. 

 To start, find a firm surface. Lay the infant on the firm surface with their face down. Make sure the infant's head is turned so they can breathe. Kneel near the infant's feet.You can also place the infant on your lap face down.  Use the heel of your hand. Deliver five quick blows to the area between the infant's shoulder blades. Hopefully, an object will pop out quickly.With an infant, be firm in the blows but do not use harsh force. You do not want to press too hard, as this could hurt an infant. Gravity combined with back blows can provide adequate force to dislodge the object., If no object pops out, turn the infant over. Support their head with your hand, keeping the head slightly lower than the feet., Place your fingers on the lower half of the infant's breastbone. Make sure to keep your hand in the middle of your infant's breastbone and not to one side of another. Press down five times in a series of chest thrusts. If you see the object become dislodged, stop giving chest thrusts., Immediately call 9-1-1 if the object does not become dislodged. As you wait, repeat the back blows and the chest thrusts. Repeating the steps may cause the object to become dislodged while you're waiting. 

hold the infant face down.  give the baby five quick blows to the back.  turn the infant over.  give the infant five chest thrusts.  call emergency services if the objects fails to come out. 

 Begin with damp hair. Spray it with a heat protectant spray. Blow-dry it roughly so that it appears tousled and messy when it is dry.You can find a heat protectant spray at many supermarkets and all beauty supply stores.  First part your hair. Part is softly; a hard part works better for sleep ponytails. Then divide your hair into at least three medium-sized sections. The amount of sections you divide your hair into depends on how thick your hair is., Going one section at a time, twist each section by holding the hair at the end. Then spritz it with a texturizing spray. Blow-dry the section. Repeat for all sections. Run your fingers through your hair when you are finished texturizing., Gather your hair into a low ponytail. Secure the ponytail with an elastic. Leave out the extra strands of hair or pull a few out for a messier look. Finish the ponytail with hairspray. 

start with blow dried hair.  divide hair into sections.  texturize the hair.  put the hair into a low ponytail. 

 Which one do you think requires the funds most? If you are unsure, discuss this with friends and family.Talk to organizations in your community, such as religious organizations, homeless shelters, veterans organizations, schools, and libraries. These types of places often need funding, and you'll make a real impact right there in your own community.; , It's helpful to have an idea of how much money you want to raise. You may find that participants are more enthusiastic when they have a concrete goal to work toward., Are you targeting your friends and family? Co-workers? Fellow classmates or their parents? The type of event that you hold should be tailored to the types of things this group of people will enjoy doing.   For example, if you're running a fundraiser to benefit your school's band, you might want to set up a bake sale or a carnival. You should also keep in mind what might not go over well with your audience. For example, you might not want to host a benefit wine tasting event if you are raising money for your conservative church.  Ideas are limited only by your creativity. You could choose to hold something traditional, such as a silent auction or a dinner, or you could try something really different, such as a race, a water-fight, or even collecting donations while wearing something silly for the whole day. Be creative!Make sure the event is an "experience." This means that you make your fundraiser fun to participate in. Ideas could be having guest speakers, a band, activities after dinner, etc.You can offer a service with your fundraiser, such as hosting a car wash, or you can have contests, such as a wacky dance contest or a karaoke contest.(If you have games or contests, you will need judges.)  , Sometimes, you have to spend money to make money. However, in order to know whether you've actually made any money for your charity, you need to establish a budget for your fundraising event.Include the cost of things like the venue, items or services for raffles, food and drink, tickets, and guest speakers or entertainers. You may be able to get services, items, and venues donated by local businesses. Explain to them that you are hosting a fundraising event for your charity and that they can earn community goodwill (and exposure for their business) by donating to your event., Email is especially useful for contacting many people at the same time, particularly for finding volunteers.   Use the contact list to find anybody who has experience with the type of fundraiser you are planning. They don’t have to have been in charge, but any experience will be helpful. This is very helpful, if you don’t have any experience!  , This is especially helpful for fundraising events that help a person or family. In many states, if you plan on asking the public for donations you must establish a bank account for your charity.Put a name on the account to be sure it is clear for tax purposes. For example, if you are raising funds for a child (let’s say Susan Smith) who is getting treatments for cancer, name the account something like the “Susan Smith Donation Fund.”  , Possible places for large indoor events include: churches, schools, wineries, restaurants or halls of fraternal organizations. Find out where other similar events have been held and ask about the availability of those places. Depending on what your event is benefiting, you might get the space donated. You can also use the contact list to ask people for ideas on a place for your event., While touring the facilities, make a map of the event ahead of time to help avoid any “traffic” problems, such as lines blocking places needing access.  Consider things such as when other fundraisers are being held. Choose an end time that takes into consideration time for clean up.  Cash and checks are fairly easy. Credit cards probably get people to spend more but are more complicated. You may consider something like Square, which works with mobile phones. Be aware that Square has fees attached. Also, credit card companies take a percentage of each sale as payment.   You can also set up a PayPal account to help you take donations. Be sure that when you set up, the entrance table has a clear large sign letting donors know to whom the checks are payable.  For example, if you are holding a raffle, you may need to speak with the gaming authority. If you're selling food, you may need to check with the health department.  If the event requires paid admission, determine prices (single, couple, family) and make tickets. Tickets are fairly cheap, so overestimate rather than underestimate the number you need. You may also use a service like EventBrite (basic service is free) to coordinate the sale of tickets and/or guest list.   You could charge a "cover" fee for a benefit concert, and then have a raffle afterward. It's a good idea to provide multiple opportunities for donors to contribute.Depending on the type of event, you might get some friends and family to donate money in return for being allowed to take part.  Consider putting a large bucket at your entrance table with a sign on it that gives people an opportunity to donate more. It works surprisingly well. Watch all money repositories very carefully. Probably nothing will happen, but it would be easy for someone to grab something and run out the door.   It's a good idea to assign one or two people to manage the money. These people should monitor the money at all times to make sure nothing happens.  Make a detailed list of everything you need. For a silent auction, for example, you will need tables, clipboards, paper, pens, and donated goods and services. If you are having catering or entertainment, you may need food, glasses, plates, lighting, etc.  Find out if a local advertising business would be willing to help. A local newspaper can be helpful. Contact both the advertising department for advertising and the editorial department or a columnist for news coverage of your event. Contact local radio and television stations to see if they will give your event news coverage or offer Public Service Announcements. Use your contact list to have people spread the word via email, Twitter, Facebook etc., If you make a flyer on your computer and know how to make it into a PDF or a JPEG, you can email that to anyone on your contact list willing to print and post flyers.  There are free websites which can help you, such as EventBrite.This gives people who can’t make it to the event a chance to donate to the cause. It also can give you an idea of how popular the event might be. (This is helpful when buying supplies.) Volunteers can try to get permission to set up tables at local businesses to sell tickets and accept donations. This is good advertising, too.   You can offer an "early bird" discount if you are charging for the tickets to encourage people to buy early. You can also offer a group discount. This will encourage people to tell their friends and book in larger groups. Consider a VIP Early Access event. For example, if you are hosting a silent auction, you can charge extra for VIP tickets that let holders get in to the auction early and scope out the goods. Or, if you're hosting a benefit concert, you could have a pre-concert meet & greet for VIPs.  There are always last-minute glitches that cause delays. Make sure you start preparation well in advance of your event's start time. A big volunteer team can help things run smoothly., A pleasant ambiance will do a lot for your fundraising event, but what that means depends on the type of event.A fancy benefit dinner might have candles and floral arrangements on the tables, whereas a charity cookout would be less formal. Make sure your event space reflects the mood you want to set for your event.  Make sure that attendees know exactly where to go and what the function of each space is. For example, if you are running a silent auction, make large signs specifying where bids can be taken, where people go to pay, etc. Use your tables to create large aisles to direct people where you want them to go.  Try to make it as fun as possible. This means being positive and energetic. Interact with the people attending your event. Let them know how thankful you are for their generosity.  Be sure to keep your receipts and careful records.   Send thank-you notes to donors and sponsors after the event., You may want to designate one person to be in charge of this.  

decide which charity you are going to help.  set your fundraising goal.  determine your audience.think about the type of people you can get to attend your fundraiser.  decide what the event is going to be.  set a budget.  find out if the cause you are championing has a list of people who would be open to being contacted.  consider opening a bank account.  find a place to hold the event.  tour the facilities to determine if there is adequate space and to find out what supplies are available to use.  determine a date and time.  decide what types of payment you will accept.  check with proper authorities to see if you need to complete any paperwork.  determine if your event will be free admission or require tickets.  get cash for change and a lock box to hold cash and checks as people pay.  purchase necessary supplies.  get the word out.  make up flyers and post them around the area.  pre-sell tickets, if you are charging admission.  start well in advance.  keep it fun.  make things clear.  start the event!.  clean up as much as possible after the event.  take the money you have collected to the charity. 

 Ask people close to you for advice on how to achieve your goals. They may have ideas and resources that can help you move closer towards doing what you want, and they will be by your side for the long run.  By joining communities filled with like-minded people, you can build connections and relationships that will help you figure out the best way to achieve what you want to do. This is one way to begin networking which can lead you to new opportunities., If someone is offering to help you in whatever way possible, be humble and accept it. Do not feel ashamed to accept assistance from those who are willing to provide it.  

get support from family and friends.  find online communities.  accept the help of others who care about you and support your dreams.

 If you cannot find a lollipop mold, pour 2 cups (250 grams) of powdered sugar onto a baking sheet, then create 10 indentations using the bottom of a spice jar.Alternatively, you can also use a baking sheet coated with cooking spray.        ; , Pour the water into a small saucepan, then stir in the sugar and corn syrup. Turn the heat up to medium and allow the sugar to dissolve.           Make sure that you use light corn syrup, or your candy won't end up clear or take color well.  Make sure that the bottom of the thermometer does not touch the bottom of the saucepan. If you don't have a candy thermometer, don't worry; you can still make candy., Turn the heat up to high, and wait for the mixture to come to a boil. Wait until it reaches the hard-crack stage, between 300 and 310°F (149 and 155°C). Do not stir the mixture during this time.         If you don't have a candy thermometer, you can test whether or not the candy is ready by dropping some of it into a glass of ice water. If the candy turns hard, it's ready.  While not necessary, a little bit of extra flavor and color can take your lollipops to the next level. Be careful while doing this, however, as the mixture may splatter.          #* Use clear flavoring extracts and oils. They will allow the color of your candy to show up better.Make sure that you use gel food coloring; liquid food coloring will not mix well into the candy.  If you are using a baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray, leave about 3 to 4 inches (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters) between each puddle to allow for spreading. If you wish to add some edible flowers, fill the molds half-way first, place the flowers face-down into the melted candy, then fill the molds the rest of the way.Use the tip of a lollipop stick to push the flowers into the molds, if needed.  Give the lollipop half a turn after you press it into the candy. Make sure that the sticks go about halfway up the melted candy.  If you used powdered sugar molds, your candy will have a frosted look. If you don't want that, run the candy under warm water for a few seconds to wash the powdered sugar layer off.         Consider sprinkling some sprinkles onto your lollipops before they harden. Gently press the sprinkles down into the melted candy to help them stick. 

lightly grease a lollipop mold with cooking spray.  combine the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a small saucepan over medium heat.  clip a candy thermometer to the side of the saucepan.  bring the mixture to a boil, then continue to cook it until it reaches the "hard-crack" stage.  take the saucepan off the stove, then stir in your flavoring oil and gel food coloring, if desired.  wait for the mixture to stop bubbling, then pour it into your molds using a metal spoon.  insert the lollipop stick.  wait for the candy to harden before you take it out of the mold. 

 Retinoids are derivatives of vitamin A which are used in many anti-aging and acne products.   Retinoids increase cell turnover, which helps to unclog the pores and makes them appear smaller.Retinol, a relatively gentle retinoid, is available in many anti-aging products sold at drug stores and beauty supply stores. Tretinoin is a stronger retinoid commonly used to treat acne and available only with a prescription; you would need to speak to your doctor or dermatologist before pursuing this treatment.  Laser treatments provide a more permanent solution to large pores.   Non-ablative laser treatments like Medlite, Genesis and Fraxel increase collagen production which tightens pores, causing them to look smaller. The major drawback to laser treatment is the cost. You will probably require two to three sessions, at $500 a pop., Accutane is a prescription medication for severe acne.   It is one of the only treatments which will physically shrink pores, rather than making them appear smaller. However, Accutane is a very strong medication which causes severe skin dryness. It is also likely that the pores will return to their original size when the treatment ends. 

use products containing retinoids.  get laser treatment.  get a prescription for accutane. 

 Your doctor is trained to know which medication is likely to work best for the pain you're experiencing. Your doctor will also know what interactions must be avoided or otherwise handled. Many drugs can interfere with existing health issues. They can also cause severe interactions and complications if used with other medications. Always consult with your healthcare professional before taking any medication for pain.   Be aware that most drugs treat acute pain. Chronic pain is far more complex and, to date, there are no known drugs that "cure" chronic pain.; , Over-the-counter products are divided into two basic groups: paracetamol/acetaminophen-based products and NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). While many of these are safe for temporary aches and pains, you should only use them in accordance with the label directions. Consult with your doctor for long-term medication plans.Talk to the pharmacist and/or your doctor about using over-the-counter medications, especially if you are already taking medications or you have a pre-existing condition. Even OTC pain relievers can cause severe complications for people with health issues such as heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney or liver disease, or internal bleeding.In the US, paracetamol is known as acetaminophen.Paracetamol/acetaminophen can be used to relieve fever, headaches, and other body aches and pains. It does not reduce inflammation. It has fewer side effects than other pain medications and is usually safe for children.NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. These can be used to relieve fever and pain. They also relieve inflammation and swelling from mild injuries. They are usually not recommended to be taken for more than 10 days. When taken for a long time to manage chronic pain, many NSAIDs can increase your risk of heart attack and stroke.In some countries, the mild opiate codeine is legal for purchase over-the-counter. In many countries, including the US, medicines containing codeine are generally available only by prescription.Be careful not to overdose. For example, an overdose of acetaminophen can cause damage to your liver and even death. Since so many medications, from headache pills to cough syrup, contain acetaminophen, it can be easy to take too much. Read the labels on OTC medications carefully.Do not take several types of pain medications together. They may have negative interactions and could cause damage.Topical pain relievers, such as lotions, creams, and sprays, are also available. These may help relieve pain from arthritis or muscle pain.You may want to look into nutritional supplements, such as glucosamine, which can ease joint pain in those suffering from arthritis., If OTC medications do not adequately manage your pain, you can speak with your doctor about prescription painkillers. It is important to consult with your doctor so that s/he can prescribe a medication that takes into account any pre-existing conditions, your level of health, the type of pain involved, and other factors. Do not attempt to use prescription painkillers unless they have been prescribed specifically for you by your doctor.Common prescriptions for pain may include muscle relaxants, prescription-strength NSAIDs, or opiate painkillers (e.g., codeine, Percocet, Vicodin). Injections are a possibility for pain relief, such as a local anesthetic, a steroid injection (anti-inflammatory) or a phenol injection (a nerve block/destroyer). Your doctor can help you decide whether this treatment is appropriate for you. Antidepressants are common and effective treatment for chronic pain, even when depression is not present.Antidepressants may be used to treat pain from arthritis, diabetes, shingles, nerve pain, migraine, back pain, and more., If you have persistent muscle pain, trigger point injection may be helpful. In this treatment, a healthcare provider uses a small needle to inject a substance into a trigger point (a knot of muscle that will not relax). Sometimes this substance is an anesthetic and/or steroid; other times it is a saline solution.This type of treatment can be used to treat fibromyalgia and other chronic muscle pains. It is usually used when other treatments have not worked. This procedure must be done by a trained healthcare provider. Never attempt it yourself.  It is important to take any medication prescribed to you for pain relief. This sounds straightforward but in reality, many people either forget or forgo their medication for various reasons. Sometimes, people may believe that the medicine is no longer helping. Other times, people will stop taking a medication when they feel better, even if the prescribed course is not complete. Not taking a medication as prescribed can cause complications and even other health issues.For example, say that you hurt the left side of your back. Without medication to take the pain away, you will unconsciously favor that side. In turn, other muscles will compensate for this favoritism, and even when your back is healed, muscle memory will continue to overuse the right side. An imbalance in your core muscle strength can, in turn, leave you with back problems, leaving you back at square one, and perhaps even worse than before.  

talk to your doctor before using medication for pain.  consider over-the-counter (otc) pain relievers.  ask your doctor about prescription painkillers.  ask about trigger point injection.  take medicine that is prescribed to you. 

 Winding down in the evening is equivalent to telling your body that it’s time to call it quits for the day. You can’t expect it to go from 100 to 0 simply by getting in bed and pulling up the covers. So spend about 30-45 minutes slowly shutting down your brain and body.   You might do this by taking a hot shower or bath. When you get out, your core body temperature drops, which is a signal to your brain to produce melatonin, your body’s natural sleep hormone.Other ways to prepare for sleep are by putting away the electronic gadgets and gaming systems and, instead, reading a book, listening to classical or relaxing music or by doing easy stretches., Caffeine is a stimulant, and while most people associate it with coffee, it’s also in tea, chocolate, soda and some pain relievers. Sleep experts recommend avoiding these things for 6 hours before going to sleep.   This may seem like a really long time, but that’s how long it takes for caffeine to leave your bloodstream., When you exercise vigorously, your body temperature goes up, and it takes several hours for it to drop to normal levels again. Because lower body temperature is needed for better sleep, don’t exercise for 3-4 hours before going to sleep.On the flip side, exercising regularly promotes good sleep. The precise mechanism between regular exercise and sleep is still uncertain, but numerous studies on various populations have shown that it works., Turn off the TV, and put away your cell phones, computers and tablets once you’re in bed. They not only prevent you from winding down because you’re so busy clicking, scrolling, typing, chatting and so forth, but they also trick your body into thinking it’s daytime and, therefore, not time to go to bed.   Here’s how it works. These devices emit a type of blue light that mimics natural light, thereby suppressing melatonin levels. When this occurs, your brain tells your body it’s not time to sleep; it disrupts your circadian rhythm.TVs also emit this light, but the problem is amplified with cell phones, laptops and tablets because they are closer to your face.  Turn off all lights while you sleep. Your circadian rhythm, or inner clock, is largely regulated by exposure to light and dark, with melatonin secreted in darkness and suppressed in light. Since melatonin induces sleep, the darker your room the better.You might also want to dim the lights during those 30-45 minutes that you are powering down before bedtime as a cue to your brain that it’s almost time to go to sleep. If you live with a roommate or there are lights that you just can’t avoid, try wearing an eye mask to block out the light.  Make sure you stick to your bedtime each night of the week. While it will be tempting to stay up late on the weekends, doing so will really throw a wrench in your internal clock and make Monday mornings rather unpleasant.  

power down before bedtime.  stay away from caffeine before bed.  avoid rigorous exercise before bed.  break electronic insomnia.  darken your room.  go to sleep the same time each night. 

 Of course you already know that you need a basketball, but do you have all the gear you need? You should have:   a basketball.       proper basketball clothing which includes a t-shirt and shorts or sweatpants       basketball shoes       a sports headband (optional)       a water bottle (with water), or Gatorade.       a timer       an ice pack       a pack of gum (this is for keeping your mouth from getting dry).      ; , Set your timer for 30 minutes, go right under the hoop and start form shooting.  Start off right under the basket. If you can't shoot 5 out of 10 shots the distance away from the basket you are, then move in. , Once the timer stops, take a 3 minute rest, then set the timer for 10 minutes again (20 if on a half court), and do the same thing over again only with your left hand dribbling the ball. After the timer is up, take a 3 minute rest, then set the timer for 10 minutes again (20 if on half court), and do the same thing over only instead of using 1 hand, dribble the ball with both(keep doing a crossover while running around the court. After the timer is up, take a 10 minute rest.  Starting at the OB line right under the hoop, run from the line to the free throw line, then back to the OB line, then run to the half court line, then run back to the OB line, then run to the other basket's free throw line, then run back to the OB line, then run from your original OB line, to the next OB line at the other hoop. Keep doing this for about 5 times. Take a three minute break and do 5 more.  If you have a friend with you, you can practice that way, but if you don't, you can bounce the ball against a wall and try to catch it as it comes back. Pass or bounce the ball from different angles (if you're using a wall it is more unpredictable, and trains you better). Do this for 30 minutes and then take a 10 minute rest.  Try to make it bounce off, and rebound it in. The objective is not to make a shot it is to miss the shot, and rebound it in, that way you practice your rebounds. After the timer stops, take a 5 minute rest.  Start off by making 3 free throw shots, then step back and make 3 three point shots, then shoot the ball run up grab it, run down the court to the other hoop, and make a basket, run back down to the other hoop and make a basket, keep doing this 5 times, then make a basket and miss, then rebound the ball back in, run down to the other hoop and do the same, do this 5 times, then pass the ball to your friend or bounce it off the wall, do this 5 times then stop. You are now finished with the exercises, so come back tomorrow and do it again!!!!!  , 

get the right gear.  head over to your favorite gym or court.  don't start off trying to lug up shots that you can't.  once the timer rings take a ten minute break.  ,  set the timer for 10 minutes, and starting at one side of the court, dribble the ball in your right hand, and start running around the court (if you are on a half court, set the timer for 20 minutes).  do some "suicides.",  work on your passing and catching skills.  set your timer for 15 minutes, and start bouncing the ball against the backboard.  put all the above exercises into one exercise, and this will be your final one.  eat healthy and get lots of sleep.  

 The main appeal of peanut butter powder is its low calorie count. A tablespoon of powdered peanut butter has about 25 calories compared to the 96 calories in the same amount of regular peanut butter. It is a good option for those looking to lose some weight but still enjoy peanut flavor., Another appealing feature of powdered peanut butter is its low fat content. 1 tablespoon contains less than 1 gram (0.035 oz) of fat, while the same amount of regular peanut butter has about 8 grams (0.3 oz) of fat. Note that the fat content of peanuts is mostly heart-healthy monounsaturated fats.A single serving of peanut butter powder is 2 tablespoons. One serving contains about 1.5 grams of fat.  Powdered peanut butter is great for adding protein and fiber nutrients without adding the extra fat — 1 tablespoon offers 3 to 4 grams (0.11 to 0.14 oz) of protein and 1 gram (0.035 oz) of fiber. This is particularly important for things like baking where the extra fat can alter the finished product. 

reduce your caloric intake.  limit your fat intake.  add a little protein or fiber. 

 The kitchen is a particularly dangerous area, so it may be simpler to keep your children away form it altogether.  Kitchen appliances such as the oven and washing machine can be dangerous to small baby. Always make sure the oven doors are closed using anti-tip brackets which can be found in many appliance-parts store. Make sure your child is not around when leaving hot oven unsupervised.   Place sharp items out of reach or in a drawer with a childproof lock. Use place mats instead of tablecloths, or simply plates. When cooking, turn saucepan handles towards the back of the stove. Ensure hot tea and coffee cups are kept well out of reach. , 

consider blocking off the whole kitchen with a baby gate.  keep your children away from ovens, microwaves, and other dangerous kitchen appliances.a kitchen should be a restricted zone and your baby should never enter it without your knowledge and supervision.  put stove covers on your stove knobs.  ,  put a childproof lock on your cabinets and drawers.  

 If your school computer isn't advanced enough, open two windows instead. Better yet (but more annoying) bookmark a certain page (on frogs or something) and keep bookmarks open. When your teacher comes around open it. This is possible because RuneScape saves as you go.; , If you don't have a RuneScape account, it is best to wait until you get home to create the account.  The video below also shows how to use a proxy to play RuneScape at school.  Use standard detail. This will make the computer run as fast as normal, and will make things less suspicious.  

open your internet browser and load an educational site on them.  in a second browser window or tab, open the runescape website and log in.  if runescape is blocked, bypass the school filter by using a proxy or another method listed in the previously linked article.  set the runescape detail to lowest and set the gaming window to fixed. 

 After you get past the entrance you need some wacky skills to beat the rest,but you only need a wee bit of skill to do the part after that. All you need to do is strum as fast as you can through the entire song. When you get to the synth part I would hit one note every four beats and then tap the rest. It works really good. When you get to the solo you need skill to do that part,but you only need to move your fingers really fast and strum as fast as you can. When you beat the solo(if you beat the solo)there will be a three way long note. The notes are Green,Yellow,and Orange so you may need to have kind of large fingers or just stretch out your fingers. The rest of the long notes are easy ones that are right next to each other,but there is only one more Yellow,green,orange long note. After you get past the long notes there will be a guitar fill which you should tap on. After you do that there will be the chorus again and another guitar fill that you need to only strum on so if you can't strum some pretty serious Guitar Hero notes then I would suggest not trying this song. The entrance comes back on and here is another Guitar Fill so do some insane skills and then you have beaten Through The Fire And Flames. If you do eventually beat this song then rock on little dude!; 

at the beginning all it is is hammer ons and offs so basically all you need to do is tap and even if it is random you will still hit somewhat a lot of notes. 

 Establish what you hope to achieve with the help of a marketing consultant. Some companies simply want to reach more clients, others hire a consultant to plan and execute a detailed marketing strategy.; ,   Talk to your professional network about marketing consultants they have used, or if they know marketing experts who might be looking for work. Word of mouth is powerful in the marketing field.  If you have a marketing director or a team of marketing staff members, ask for their input.   Remind them that they are not being replaced. Staff might feel threatened by the use of consultants, but if they are involved in choosing and working with the consultants from the beginning, the relationship will be far more harmonious and productive.  You can get the names of local marketing consultants by searching for them online.   Use the Internet to explore the online reputations of different consultants as well. Spend some time on their websites and reading testimonials and reviews before you select a few of them to interview.  

determine your goals.  ask for referrals.  include any marketing professionals you have on staff.  conduct an internet search.

 If a shy guy likes you, he might be afraid to talk to you. Instead, he will probably try to steal some glances in your direction. If you notice him looking at you, he will look away as quickly as possible. This doesn't mean he doesn't like you. In fact, it can mean just the opposite., If he likes you, he might light up when you come around. Look for a smile and a twinkle in his eyes when he sees you. This might mean that he likes you, especially if he doesn't react this way when other people come around., If he likes you, he will probably be nervous around you. If he seems especially awkward around you (dropping things, stumbling over his words) it might mean he likes you.You can help ease his awkwardness by giving him your undivided attention. Also, avoid laughing at him if he drops something or stumbles over his words.  

catch him glancing at you.  notice him light up when he sees you.  take note of awkward interactions. 

 Fiber-rich foods are known to help stimulate your bowels. Unfortunately, these foods, such as many fruits and vegetables, often get overlooked in a person's daily diet. Don't think of veggies or fruits as optional side dishes, but as crucial parts of every balanced meal. Not only will these foods relieve constipation, but they will also promote digestive health by improving your diet. Recommended fiber intake varies greatly by age, sex, and other factors, so talk with your doctor or use an online tool to help you figure out how much you should be getting.Here are some foods to add to your diet:Avocado, split peas, broccoli, kale, green peas, and lentils Bran cereal, oatmeal, brown rice, and flax seeds Black beans, kidney beans, lima beans, navy beans, pinto beans, and soybeans Raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, blueberries, and oranges Cabbage and cauliflower Almonds, dried figs, and olives Papaya and peaches; , If adding a few fiber-rich foods to your diet doesn't improve your problem, you can try a three-day fast of a high-fiber vegetable, or substituting one or two of your meals for foods that are entirely fiber-rich. This is not a good long-term solution because a balanced diet does require proteins and carbohydrates as well, but the three-day method can work in a pinch.   Cabbage is particularly good because it's not only high in fiber, but it has enzymes which encourage the entire digestive tract to "flush." Cabbage can be prepared in a number of ways, including skillet frying, if the oil used is grape-seed oil or olive oil. You should vary your recipes so the three-day fast becomes enjoyable.  Consider taking a fiber supplement even if you think you are able to get that much fiber from your daily meals. Though these supplements aren't guaranteed to work, they have helped people relieve their constipation in some cases. Some semi-synthetic or synthetic fibers, such as Citrucel, Metamucil, or Perdiem, can do the trick., Constipation can also be caused by insufficient hydration. Generally drink a minimum of 33-66 ounces (1.5-2 liters) per day, or more depending on your size, the weather, or amount of exercise. Constipation results from a lack of liquid in your stools, and hydrating can help this problem.   If you're having a bout of constipation, increase your water consumption for 3-4 days, starting with a big glass in the morning and drinking regularly throughout the day. Water may not help with all forms of constipation, but can help relieve constipation caused by dehydration. Likewise, drinking water before and during meals may help prevent future constipation.Other drinks, such as juice and soda, cannot compare regardless of how healthy or natural they are, because they tend to contain excessive sugar that could actually exacerbate constipation., Prunes are especially high in fiber and contain sorbitol, a stool-loosening sugar that naturally helps relieve constipation. Sorbitol is a mild colonic stimulant that helps reduce transit time of stool and thus decrease the risk of constipation.If you don't like the wrinkly texture or unique taste of prunes, prune juice may be a more palatable alternative.   Prunes can be more effective for relieving constipation than prune juice. Prunes have 14.7g of sorbitol per 100g, whereas prune juice has 6.1g per 100g. You will have to drink more prune juice to achieve the same health benefits because the prunes are processed, and you will have to take in additional sugars.  This requires that you eat a banana by thoroughly chewing it. Make sure that the banana is very ripe, not unripe, or it can have the opposite effect., Constipation can result from over consumption of refined sugar, and dairy in comparison to fiber from whole grains, bran, fruits and vegetables. Avoid foods that are high in sugar, like candy or cookies, as well as too much cheese, red meat, white bread, white rice, and hard boiled eggs. You don't have to cut these foods out of your diet completely, but you should cut down on these foods if you're having trouble evacuating your bowels. Here are some other foods to avoid:Chips and crackers Frozen dinners, which are often high in fat and low in fiber Cookies Fried foods like fries, doughnuts, and onion rings Heavily breaded foods Dairy products like butter, ice cream, and cheeseRed meat  , Alcohol can dehydrate you and make you more constipated.Limiting or stopping your intake of alcohol can help you relieve your bowels. 

add more fiber-rich foods to your diet.  increase the intensity of fiber.  take a fiber supplement.  hydrate well.  add prunes or prune juice to your diet.  try the banana cure for mild constipation.  avoid foods that may cause constipation.  avoid alcohol. 

 This is important, as the fresher your garlic, the longer it will last.          The garlic bulb should be firm with papery dry skin and have no sprouting. Soft bulbs indicate over-ripe garlic that will not store for very long. Avoid shriveled garlic bulbs or those that are stored in the refrigerated section of the grocery store.; , Drying your homegrown garlic before storing allows the flavor to develop and become more concentrated.         Wash your recently harvested garlic bulb and allow it to dry in a dark, but moisture-free, place for about a week. You can hang garlic from its stalks to dry.  Many people make the mistake of storing garlic in the refrigerator, but garlic actually does best at a cool room temperature of around 60 °F (16 °C).         Refrigerating garlic is a bad idea as it causes the bulb to deteriorate. Refrigerating garlic bulbs adds moisture and can cause the bulb to grow moldy. If you have chopped or minced fresh garlic, you can store it in the refrigerator in a sealed container for a short period, but use it as soon as possible. Freezing is not recommended, because it changes the consistency and flavor of the garlic.  Storing your garlic bulbs in a well-ventilated spot allows the garlic to "breathe" and will extend its shelf-life.         Garlic bulbs can be kept in a mesh or wire basket, a small bowl with ventilation holes or even a paper bag. Do not store fresh garlic bulbs in plastic bags or sealed containers. This can cause mold and sprouting.  Your kitchen cupboard or a shady corner of your kitchen counter top is perfect for this.          Keep your garlic away from sunlight and moisture to avoid sprouting.  The shelf life of your garlic is shortened significantly when you break up the bulb to remove the cloves.          If the garlic begins to feel soft, or the cloves have green sprouts through the middle, then it is time to throw the garlic away. Unbroken garlic bulbs can be kept up to 8 weeks if stored properly. Cloves broken from the garlic bulb will keep from 3-to-10 days.  Homegrown, new season garlic will need to be refrigerated directly upon harvesting.          Also called "young wet" garlic, these garlic bulbs are harvested in early summer and have a mild flavor. They do not need to be dried and can be refrigerated for up to a week. New season garlic has a milder flavor than regular garlic and can be used in place of onions and leeks in cooking.  

purchase or harvest garlic that is fresh and firm.  dry homegrown garlic bulbs before storing.  store garlic at room temperature.  keep garlic in a location with good air circulation.  store fresh garlic bulbs in a dark, dry spot.  use garlic quickly once you have broken the bulb.  be aware that storage for "new season garlic" is different from regular garlic. 

 Smooth it out and undo the buttoned area.; , Make sure the comb is clean.  This will lift the button from the garment, separating it and the thread will be obvious above the comb, just under the button.  Leaving the comb in place, use a razor or extremely fine scissors to cut the thread above the comb and remove the button.  Remove remaining pieces of thread. 

lay your garment flat.  take a comb.  slide the comb under the button.  cut the thread.  take the comb off.repeat as needed for remaining buttons. 

 When you’re wearing a headband with your hair down, virtually any style will work. You can opt for a traditional horseshoe style headband made of plastic or metal or a stretchy fabric headband, and you can choose a thin headband for a delicate look or a wide headband for a bolder look.Embellished headbands, such as those with large bows or flowers attached, work very well when you’re wearing your hair down.   You can find all headband styles in a variety of colors and patterns, so it’s easy to find an option that will match your outfit.; , To ensure that your hair looks neat when you place the headband, you should brush it before hand. Brush your hair all the way down to the ends so it’s smooth and entirely free of tangles.         You may prefer to use a wide-tooth comb to brush through your hair because they don’t tug at your hair as much as a brush does. If you aren’t happy with the natural texture of your hair, you can use a flat iron to straighten your locks or curling iron to add curls or waves after you brush it.    , After you’ve removed any tangles from your hair, you can choose to add a part or not before you put the headband on. If you don’t want a part, just comb your back and away from your face. If you want a part, choose a side and carefully comb your hair over to that side.         Wearing a part with a headband typically looks best if you have bangs. After parting your hair, place the headband right where your bangs separate from the rest of your hair for the most flattering look.  Once your hair is neatly combed and parted as you want, slide the headband into over your hair. Position it so it rests approximately ½ inch (1.27 cm) from your hairline, and adjust your hair as you like, such as pulling it over your ears or pushing it behind them.         If you have bangs, you can use the headband to push them back and hold them off your face or you can pull the bangs loose from the headband, depending on the look that you prefer.  

consider your headband options.  brush through your hair to remove tangles.  decide whether you want a part or not.  place the headband on your hair.

Do your best to eat three healthy meals a day and to avoid skipping meals.If you skip a meal, try to fill in the gap with a can or bottle of a nutritional drink. Keep quick snacks on hand, such as almonds, to keep your energy up when you’re assisting your loved one.  Caregivers often have trouble getting enough sleep, which is a major cause of burnout. A lack of sleep can have an impact on emotional health, impact your ability to offer care, and compromise your immune system. Make an effort to find regular respite care, whether from someone you know and trust, a private organization, or a community service group.Do your best to get weekly time off to catch up on rest. Try to make it a goal to gradually develop a healthy sleep routine. Listen to relaxing music, read a book, or meditate before bedtime. Avoid caffeine at night or within six hours of bedtime. Try to sync up your sleep time with your care receiver’s and sleep when they do.  Make a daily effort to do things that you make you happy. Once you find regular respite care, use your time off to do things you love whenever you can, like catching a movie, grabbing a bite to eat with a friend, or going to a museum.Never feel guilty about needing personal time or having to take a day off. Try to something small for yourself every day. For example, while your loved one naps, read a book, listen to music, knit, or do another activity that you find relaxing.  Keep up with family members and friends. Try to have conversations with loved ones that will allow you to get your mind off of caregiving for a moment. Share your feelings with someone you trust to vent and perhaps seek advice from.Feeling isolated is a common symptom of caregiver burnout, so do your best to avoid it by staying close to your personal support system.  Even if you are doing all that you can to take care of yourself and prevent caregiver burnout, you may still experience it at some point. Therefore, it is important to know how to recognize the signs of caregiver burnout and seek help as soon as you notice them:Feeling depressed. Losing interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy. Feeling worthless or guilty. Experiencing changes in appetite or weight. Lacking energy. Feeling fearful. Sleeping too much or too little. Lacking interest in personal hygiene. Lacking interest in sex. Having anxiety. Crying easily. Being easily distracted. Experiencing agitation or restlessness. Having an inability to concentrate or make decisions.  

make sure you eat and exercise.  get as much sleep as possible.  make time for yourself.  maintain your other relationships.  watch for signs of caregiver burnout. 

 Make sure that the people involved feel comfortable. Be sure that you remain neutral and listen. In order to remain neutral it is important to pay close attention to your reactions. Try to keep facial expressions to a minimum and try to keep an equal amount of eye contact with the two of them. It will help you if you keep your responses short and be confident. Using words like create, explore, clarify, and share will help encourage positive responses while words like must, require, impose, and expect may do the opposite. Jot down questions in shorthand when they come into your head so that you do not interrupt one the participants and save your questions until the end.  Some ground rules you may want to consider would be courteous treatment and openness to new ideas. Direct the flow of discussion and stress uninterrupted time., Decide who speaks first and listen to both equally. None of the parties are allowed to interrupt the opposite party when there is their turn to talk. They might like to take notes to remember the ideas that they need to refer to but they can't interrupt no matter how important it is what they need to say., Re-frame their statements into more neutralizing statements. Reflect their emotions and neutralize their perspectives.  Ex 1. Statement: "I can't believe she fluffed another presentation." Reflected: "You're concerned about the quality of the presentation." Ex 2. Statement: "The presentation was a total wreck." Neutralized: "The presentation didn't go as well as you had hoped."  , In this agenda your ultimate goal is to transition from the past situations to future situations. You want to separate their topics and label and define the issues. Consider common agenda topics and use the agenda for negotiations. Have the participants choose one topic at a time to discuss and be thorough on the topic before you move on. If the participants get stuck, its okay to come back to that topic later and move to the next one. Be sure to talk about every concern and idea on the list., In order to avoid conflict between the parties, as part of the ground rules the best idea is to request that all the conversations will take place through the chair. The parties are not allowed to address each other at any moment of the mediation. In this way there is a less chance that the negative feelings will come to the surface during the discussion. 

work effectively.  make sure that everyone knows the ground rules for discussion.  make sure each participant gets the chance to present their perspective.  summarize and reflect.  create an agenda.  speak through the chairperson. 

 If you are under 18, make sure you get permission from a parent or guardian before you get the piercing. You need to have this approval so that you don't waste your time taking care of a piercing that you'll just have to take out regardless.; , Find a piercer with a good reputation at a reputable tattoo or piercing shop. Read customer reviews online to find out information about the piercer's reputation, and make sure the piercer has completed an apprenticeship with a reputable piercer.  It is crucial for a piercing/tattoo shop to be sterile and clean. If you go to the store, and it does not appear immaculately clean, don't get a piercing there.  When you get the piercing, make sure that the piercer opens up a package of unused, sterile needles to use for your piercing. This is crucial to prevent the spread of infection and disease.  The piercing itself will hurt minimally. The initial healing and swelling are the worst part.  For the actual piercing, the piercer will take a clamp and put it on your tongue to hold it in place. This protects you from jerking when the piercing happens.  There will be more symptoms for the first 3-5 days immediately after getting the piercing. Expect to see swelling, light bleeding, bruising, and tenderness, especially during this initial period.  Drink lots of ice cold water and let small ice chips melt in your mouth to help keep the swelling down. Make sure they are small ice chips so you don't freeze your mouth.   Don't suck on the ice chips; just let them melt in your mouth.  Avoid tobacco, alcohol, large amounts of caffeine, oral sexual contact (including french kissing), chewing gum, and playing with your jewelry during the initial week of healing.  These can cause stinging and burning sensations on and near the piercing.  Even if you follow these steps and do exactly what the aftercare sheet says, there could still be a whitish goo that come out of the piercing hole. This is normal and is not an infection. Just make sure that it is not puss.  After you get the piercing, use alcohol-free mouthwash 4 or 5 times daily for up to 60 seconds, including after meals and at bedtimes.  To clean the outside of the piercing, dab sea salt on the piercing 2 to 3 times daily and wash with mild anti-microbial soap up to twice a day.  Always wash your hands with antibacterial soap before cleaning or touching the piercing or jewelry.Never touch the piercing except during moments of cleaning.  Dry the piercing after cleaning with a paper towel or napkin instead of a bath towel or cloth. Towels can contain germs and bacteria, so it is better to use a disposable paper product instead.  Occasionally, the balls on tongue piercing bars can become unscrewed or loose over time. It is important that you regularly check to make sure they are tight. Use one hand to hold the bottom ball in place and use the other hand to tighten the top ball.   Note: To tighten the balls, remember twisting to the right tightens and twisting to the left loosens.  Know that the original jewelry should be replaced with shorter jewelry after the swelling has reduced. See your piercer for this change, because it usually will be during the healing period.  Once the initial healing process is over, you can pick any of the many styles of jewelry for your tongue piercing. Just keep in mind if you have metal allergies or sensitivities to certain materials.  

get permission.  do your research.  check out the shop.  make sure sterile utensils are used.  expect a little pain.  don't be surprised.  know what to expect.  use ice chips to help with swelling.  avoid potentially harmful objects/activities.  avoid spicy, hot, salty or acidic foods for a while.  expect some discharge.  rinse your mouth.  clean the piercing.  wash your hands.  dry the piercing properly.  check the balls regularly.  change the jewelry after the initial swelling dissipates.  choose the right style for you.

 Most devotional books and collections are built around a single theme, and that theme is usually directed toward a specific audience. Keep your theme and chosen audience in mind as you research and collect materials for your devotional.   For instance, you may choose to write a devotional for new mothers. “New mothers” are your audience and “motherhood” is the general theme. While you do not need to limit each individual entry to a topic that relates directly to motherhood, the overall tone of your book should address that theme.      ; , More specifically, start from a place deeply rooted in your personal relationship with God. Doing so will make it easier to be passionate and write spiritually sincere words.   Ask yourself what topics have been spiritually significant in your own life or which target audiences you feel called to work with.       As you prepare to write, consider writing devotionals based on your personal Bible study, life experiences, or everyday circumstances., Each individual devotional entry has four main components: a scriptural passage, a meditation, a prayer, and a key thought.The Scripture portion can be a few short verses or a long passage. For longer passages, consider writing out a short portion of that passage and providing the citation for the full passage below or above the quotation. Including a long passage on a page can make that entry seem cluttered.       The meditation or reflection should connect directly to the verses you quoted before it. Seek to explain those verses with fresh insight.       The prayer should be short and simple. Construct a few sentences that are related to the lesson you reviewed in your meditation.       The key thought is usually a simple, one-sentence summary of the lesson learned. It can also be a call to action.  Meditations can be personal or objective, but they need to address the topic at hand in a meaningful way. There are four main types of meditation you can expect to use: commentaries on scriptures, anecdotes, facts, and compilations.   Commentaries are usually used when your scripture passages are notably long. Break down the story or idea presented in that passage into further detail.       Stories are fairly common, as well. When you use a short verse, you might retell a longer Biblical story connected to that verse. Alternatively, you might tell a more personal story connected to your life or the life of someone you know.       Factual meditations use scientific or historical facts to explain the significance of the verses presented before the meditation.       Compilations are a combination of multiple meditation types.  When putting together a collection of devotions, consider how many devotions to include and how long the overall work should be. The right answer will vary depending on the market and purpose of your devotional.   Many devotional books are monthly and include 30 to 31 individual devotions. If you are publishing a booklet, a week's worth of devotionals might be all you need, though. Conversely, if you have enough to say on the theme of your devotional, you can write several months' worth, instead.       Some devotional books are also written by liturgical seasons. For instance, a Lenten devotional will usually cover the 40 days of Lent, the rest of Holy Week, and Easter.  You should be prayerful throughout the entire process, but it is especially important to pray for guidance when developing individual devotional entries. Good devotionals will help the reader draw closer to God, so God needs to be at the center of your writing. Pray for the ability to convey the truth in clarity, humility, and courage.   Ask God what He would have you write about. You may already have an idea in your head, but be open to other ideas and thoughts that come to mind as you pray.       On the other hand, if you don't "hear" anything specific as you pray for guidance, don't let that stop you from pressing forward. Writer's block can happen even when you're working on a project like this. You need to write your way through it if you want the ideas to start flowing again.  A standard entry in a devotional book is no longer than 500 words. Keeping the entry short will keep your writing concise and poignant. Short writings are also easier for readers to pay attention to.   If you tend to get carried away as you write, aim for writing something between 250 and 350 words. That way, if you end up writing too much by accident, you'll probably still be under 500 words.The other option is simply to cut out and revise a lengthy entry until you can trim it down to 500 words.  If you're writing a collection of devotionals, your overall work will have a somewhat broad theme. Each individual entry will need to be even more focused, but the subtopic you choose for the entry must still fit in with the overall theme of the collection as a whole.   Try to connect the idea presented to at least one of your readers' physical senses (sight, sound, touch, taste, or smell). For instance, you could describe the sound of a church bell or the smell of incense.  This might seem like an obvious statement, but any narrative meditation you include must have some form of exposition/rising action, climax, and falling action. Build up to your main point, declare your main point, and explain that point in further detail as needed.   When describing your own experience, for example, provide context for the experience, describe the experience itself, and share with readers the lesson you learned from your experience.  Sometimes, you will need to build a reflection around a chosen verse. Other times, you will write a meditation first and find the verse you need afterward. Make sure that the verse connects directly to the idea behind your meditation.   When quoting scripture, always cite the version of the Bible you are quoting from since translations often vary.       Never take a verse out of context or try to bend it into a shape that matches your meditation. If necessary, revise your meditation rather than revising the verse.  Check and recheck everything you write. This applies to scriptural passages you include as well as any external facts you mentioned.   When verifying the verses you used, make sure that you have the correct wording for the translation version you cited.  Each individual entry needs to prompt the reader to take action in his or her own relationship with God. The action can be major or minor, as well as internal or external. Regardless of the action itself, you need to encourage the reader to be an active part of the experience.   The action should relate directly to the message of that devotional entry. For example, if the entry was about forgiveness, ask the reader to consider whether he or she has been holding a grudge against someone and, if so, what the reader needs to do to let go of that anger and forgive the offender in question.  You don't need to have all the answers. Your primary task is to prod the reader forward on his or her faith journey. There are times when a deep, reflective question may accomplish that goal better than a halfhearted answer could.   Good devotional writing has an exploratory nature to it. Sometimes you will arrive at a conclusion, and sometimes you won't. This is a natural part of spiritual growth, so you needn't force an answer when a question is all that remains at the end of your exploration.On a similar note, don't be afraid to present yourself in a somewhat unfavorable way in a particular meditation. Readers can learn from your struggles and mistakes in the same way they learn from your questions.  Most devotionals are written in a conversational and fairly casual tone of voice. You still need to use good grammar and proper spelling, but keep the tone as natural and comfortable as you can.  Writers who try their hand at a devotional often make similar mistakes in regards to content and language. Make yourself aware of these potential pitfalls beforehand so that you can avoid them as much as possible.   Use the first person point of view as little as possible. You can use "I," "me," "my," etc., when sharing a personal experience. At all other points, however, the first person should be avoided. Stick with the third person ("he," "she," "they") or second person ("you") as much as possible.       Watch your wording, as well. Avoid preaching, pouting, or pointing fingers.       Meditations can take a lot of different forms, but they are not testimonies, tributes to specific people, sermons, formal Bible teachings, journal entries, fine literature, or biographical/autobiographical sketches.       Avoid common or trivial symbols. A flower struggling to grow in a cement parking lot conveys the beauty of struggle, but it's overused and should be avoided unless you have a unique spin to present.       Show, don't tell. Resist the temptation to spell everything out to your readers.  Your devotional might be honest, fresh, and from the heart, but if there are structural problems with your writing, no one will be able to see the value of your work underneath all the muck. Revise your work until it is as clean, cohesive, and coherent as possible.   Aim to sell with each work you complete. Be confident in your writing, but make sure that your writing is up to par with other words you would expect to find on the shelf of your nearest Christian bookstore. If you wouldn't buy a book of its quality from someone else, don't expect someone else to buy it from you.  Some criticism is constructive and should be taken to heart. Other criticism is destructive and should be ignored. Learn to tell the two types apart from each other. Use constructive criticism to improve your writing, and try not to let yourself get discouraged when you hear destructive criticism.   You might also receive criticism from those outside of the publishing industry for wanting to make money on the devotionals you write. You can give you work away for free if that's what you feel God has called you to do; however, there is no shame in using your God-given talents to support yourself financially., Send your devotional to the market that is most likely to publish it. No matter how great your writing is, a publisher that doesn't publish devotionals (or one that doesn't publish your type of devotional) will not accept it.   Pay attention to things like target audience, length, and theme. Don't send a year-long devotional to a publisher that only publishes month-long devotionals. If your devotional is geared toward teenagers dealing with illness, don't send it to a publisher that deals exclusively with devotionals for adults.       Every publisher has writer's guidelines. Publishers with websites usually post these guidelines online. If you can't find those guidelines posted anywhere, though, write to that publisher and ask for their writer's guidelines before you submit your work.  The vast majority of writers will receive plenty of rejection letters, and devotional writers are no exception. If your submission is rejected, don't get discouraged. Instead, take the opportunity to revise it one more time before sending it out to another publisher for consideration.  

know your theme and your audience.  start from a personal place.  familiarize yourself with the basic components.  determine your meditation type.  choose the right length for your overall work.  be prayerful.  keep each devotional short.  focus on one subtopic for each entry.  write a beginning, middle, and end.  choose key verses.  check your facts.  inspire action.  don't be afraid to ask questions.  write in your own voice.  beware of a few common pitfalls.  edit your work.  expect criticism.  choose the best market for your work.  revise and send your work back out. 

 If you are uncomfortable lying to your current employer, it is okay to give a vague reason why you need time off. Most of the time, giving a vague reason will not prompt questioning from your employer because it implies a personal matter. Here are some acceptable vague reasons:   I need time off for a personal matter. I need time off to take care of a time-sensitive issue. I need time off to deal with a sensitive situation.  Realistic excuses are more believable because these situations can happen to anyone at any time and render less suspicion. Realistic excuses can include any of the following:   Dr.’s appointment Dentist appointment Child or other family member is sick Childcare or elder care issue Meeting with child’s school Meeting with financial advisor Meeting with insurance agent House issues (bugs, plumbing, heat or air condition, electrical, or carpets) Car trouble (battery, tire, or car won’t start)  , Excuses that can be seen as negative to your existing job and security or excuses that can be discovered as lies should be avoided:   Jail time. This may be a cause to fire you, may be written in your file, and/or stain a recommendation. Car accident. No damage to your car will be a giveaway. Injury to you during an accident will be discovered as a lie. Questions may be asked later on if you give an excuse of being in someone else’s car during an accident. Broken body part. You cannot wear a fake cast for weeks! Bad injury. You don’t want to limp on the wrong leg next week! Death in the family. What if they later on figure out this person is still alive?  , Do not drag on the story into a mini drama. Giving an excuse, answering a few brief questions and leaving it alone is good enough. Sometimes coming up with elaborate stories can reveal inconsistencies within your story and/or outrageous claims causing suspicion.  Remember which excuse you provided and keep to the story later on. You never know when someone will ask you about it. They may not mean anything by it, but if you slip up, there will be doubts and confusion of where you really were.   If you stick to your simple excuse, you should be okay and free to attend an interview without suspicion.  

be vague if you do not want to lie.  make a realistic excuse.  do not choose an excuse that is negative or will catch up to you later on.  keep it simple.  stick to the story. 

 For large, publicly trade businesses this shouldn't be too hard to find, since by law they are required to post periodic financial statements.; , Important things to look for include:   Net Sales Net Income Current Assets Total Assets Current Liabilities Long-Term Liabilities Total Liabilities Common Stock Retained Earnings  ,   The return on assets ratio is like an overall indicator of how efficiently a business uses its resources. It is figured by dividing net income by total assets. The higher the ratio, the better the investment. The earnings per share ratio is used for businesses that publicly trade stock. It is found by dividing net income by the average number of outstanding shares. It should be compared to other companies as well as a business's own previous earnings per share. The price earnings ratio tells what investors expect to make from a share of stock. It is calculated by dividing the market value per share by the earnings per share. A ratio above fifteen is considered excellent. The dividend yield measures the amount of cash you receive as dividends from one share of stock. It is found by dividing the amount of annual dividends per share by the price per share. A low dividend yield doesn't necessarily mean a business is doing bad; it might mean that that business is simply reinvesting more of its profits back into itself.    The current ratio measures a company's ability to repay short-term liabilities with only its short-term assets. It is found by dividing current assets by current liabilities. Different industries have different expectations here, but generally anything above one is good. The quick ratio is like the current ratio, only it is a little more stringent because it excludes inventories from current assets. Therefore, it is calculated by dividing quick assets, which are current assets minus inventories, by current liabilities. A ratio of 1:1 is pretty common. The receivables turnover ratio shows how well a business does in providing credit and collecting its receivables. It is figured by dividing net credit sales by the average amount of the accounts receivable. The higher the turnover, the better the business is at collecting debts. The inventory turnover ratio signifies how often a company sells its inventory and replaces it in a time period. It is found by dividing the average cost of goods sold by the average inventory. A high turnover means that a business more than likely has very strong sales.    The long-term debt to total assets ratio shows how much of a company's assets are financed by long-term liabilities, which are defined as those lasting longer than a year. It is figured by dividing long-term liabilities by total assets. The times interest earned ratio determines a business's capacity to finance its accrued interest. It is calculated by dividing income (before interest expense and income tax expense) by the interest expense. A ratio above two is generally considered good.  

obtain a company's balance sheet and income statement.  locate the different totals and subtotals on the two financial statements.  use profitability ratios to see how efficient and productive a business is, and how easily its cash flows.  use liquidity ratios to see how easily a business is able to pay off its short-term debts and respond to cash needs.  use solvency ratios to see how easily a business is able to pay off its long-term debts and other obligations. 

 To potty train a dog, keep track of when your dog usually uses the bathroom. Most dogs eliminate shortly after dinnertime. Track your dog's bathroom habits for about a week. Then, try to schedule letting your dog out around the time he usually has to eliminate., You can actually train your dog to eliminate on command. Create a command that you will use to signal to your dog it's time to go. Something like, "Go potty" should be sufficient. Say this command when you notice your dog squatting or sniffing as this means he will probably eliminate soon., Dogs tend to respond best to positive reinforcement. Always praise your dog when he eliminates outside.   Say something like "Good boy" immediately after your dog eliminates. Then, pet him a bit to show him he's done well.Some dogs respond well to a reward like a small treat. Consider taking a small bag of treats with you when you let your dog out. Give your dog a treat as a reward as soon as he eliminates., Dogs do not respond well to punishment. Scolding your dog after he's eliminated inside or confining him to his crate as punishment will not help. It will only create a stressful situation for the dog that might make accidents more frequent. If you catch your dog in the act, clap your hands fast and say "No!" and then take him outside. However, never punish a dog after an accident has occurred. Dogs live in the immediate moment as they might be confused as to why they're in trouble., If your dog does have an accident indoors, clean up the area thoroughly. Dogs tend to be attracted to spots where they've previously eliminated. Accidents might reoccur if you do not clean an area after an accident.   Look for special cleaners designed to remove pet urine and feces. However, urine especially can be difficult to get out of carpet. You may have to hire a carpet cleaner. 

figure out when your dog usually eliminates.  create a command.  use positive reinforcement.  avoid punishment.  clean up accidents. 

 Ensure that all the joints, straps and pivot points are correctly connected. Do this every time you use the table in order to avoid a serious accident.   Read your inversion table instructional manual thoroughly before attempting to use the table. It will support your body weight, so it is important that all the steps are done correctly. Make sure you have a friend with you when you use the inversion table for the first time, in case there are problems.; , They will give you an extra firm support when the table locks into place. Never use the inversion table with bare feet.  Raise your feet onto the steps one at a time. Lean forward with a straight back to pull up the lever and lock your feet in place.  Inversion tables differ in how they secure your body in place. They may have an ankle bar, body strap or other device, so make sure all the safety gears are locked in place before inverting yourself.  You will push off these straps to invert your body.  This will allow the blood flow to adjust. Slowly return to the starting position before unhooking yourself and getting out.  

secure your inversion table on a flat surface.  wear athletic shoes when you use an inversion table.  step into position, with your back toward the table.  place the straps over your body.  grasp the straps on either side of the table.  return to a horizontal position for 1 to 2 minutes when you start to come up from your inversion. 

 If your clay is only slightly hard, you may be able to soften it just by warming and kneading it with your hands. Before you start kneading the clay, hold the clay in your hands to warm it. You can also warm it using the heat of your body by sitting on top of it.Warmth helps to revitalize the clay. If your clay is only a little bit hard, you may be able to restore its softness just using body heat. No matter what method you use to soften clay, always warm it first.; , If the clay is especially hard, you may need to use a heat source to soften the clay. Lay a hot water bottle over your clay for twenty minutes to help soften it.You can also use a heat lamp, but be sure to not heat the clay over body temperature. This can cause the clay to start to bake, which will make it unusable. Additionally, you can put the clay in the microwave for 10 second spurts until it is warm.  Once the clay has softened, roll it between your hands in a snake shape, then roll it into a ball. Rolling the clay creates friction, which helps to soften it.You can also cut the clay into small pieces, then roll it.  If the clay is still too hard to roll with your hands, you may to use more force. Lay the piece of clay on a clean cutting board or on the counter, then press down on the clay to flatten it out as much as you can. Then roll the clay out with a rolling pin. After you roll it out, it should be warm enough to roll with your hands.  If your clay is too hard to roll out with a rolling pin, you will need a large amount of force. Break the clay up into as small of pieces as you can, then place the clay pieces in a sealed plastic bag. Wrap the bag with a cloth and put it on the floor or on the cement or pavement outside.Use a rubber mallet to pound on the clay for several minutes. Using the mallet will break up the clay and add friction which will make it softer. After you have used the rubber mallet, take the clay out of the bag and roll it with your hands into a ball.  After you have rolled the clay, knead the clay with your hands on a counter just as you would with dough. Use as much force as you need to pull apart and reshape the clay.Kneading the clay ensures that you handle the entire surface area of the clay. You can also use a clay-kneading machine if you don’t want to knead by hand.  

warm the clay with body heat.  warm the clay using a heat source.  roll the clay in your hands.  roll with a rolling pin.  hit the clay with a mallet.  knead the clay. 

 There are many different salts available, and they all have different properties.The amount of Epsom salt (MgSO4) that you can dissolve into a given amount of water at a given temperature will differ from the amount of table salt (NaCl) that you can dissolve into the same water. If you are trying to understand the dissolution process in general, you should stick with using table salt.If you need to study the properties of a specific salt, use that salt.; , The kind of water you use matters. For example, tap water has more contaminants than distilled water. Deionized water can often be even more pure than distilled water. The purer the water (i.e. the less contaminants it contains) the more salt you will be able to dissolve into it.This is because there are fewer water molecules acting on other substances in the water, and therefore, more molecules to act on your salt.  You will need to decide how much (how many grams) salt you intend to put into your water. You will also need to know how much water you are using. If you use too much salt (or too little water) then you will not be able to dissolve all of it.You can add salt slowly to see approximately how much can be dissolved in a given amount of water (at a given temperature). You can dissolve more salt by adding more water or heating it up.  If you are measuring out a specific amount of water, you can use a graduated cylinder or a beaker. If you aren’t as worried about exact measurements, any container will do. Keep in mind that the temperature of the container can affect the temperature of your water. This isn’t a big deal for most experiments, but if you are doing highly controlled experiments, it is worth considering.Make sure to label your container, especially if you are working in a lab with other people.  Put weigh paper or a weigh boat on your scale and zero the scale. Add salt a little at a time until you reach the desired amount of salt. Record the exact amount of salt that you used., If the salt does not immediately dissolve, try mixing it with a spoon or spatula. You need water molecules to come in contact with your salt to dissolve it, and stirring things up helps that happen more quickly. You can also heat the mixture to help the salt dissolve., When you are analyzing how much salt you can or cannot dissolve into a given volume of water, you should consider the temperature. Warmer water will dissolve more salt than cooler water, regardless of the type of salt you are using. If you are doing a formal experiment, you should record the exact temperature of your water., The more solutes (things dissolved into the water) present, the less water molecules are available to interact with your salt. There can also be interaction between the solutes and the salt, depending on what solutes are present. If you are not studying the interaction of a specific solute with your salt, it is best to use distilled or deionized water to minimize the amount of contamination., Your water isn’t the only non-perfect substance you’ll be working with. Your salt is bound to have some level of impurity. If you purchased your salt, it is likely food or commercial grade and the impurities will be negligible for most experiments. If you made your own salt or mined your own salt, then impurities might be higher. 

choose a salt.  choose your water.  decide how much of each you will use.  pour your water into a container.  weigh out your salt.  pour the salt into the water.  account for the temperature of the water.  account for other solutes in the water.  account for impurities in your salt. 

 Phone records and call logs can be checked. Computers’ browser histories can be traced. You can try erasing your call log or internet cookies and history. Some browsers also allow you to set them to “private” mode. But if you are worried that your abuser is monitoring your communication with others, you might want to find another computer or phone to use.Most public libraries offer computers with internet access to community members. This could be a good place to start. You may want to get a prepaid cellular phone. This could come in handy while looking for help and later, when you actually leave. You could also use a friend or neighbor’s computer or phone. If necessary, make an excuse such as your own computer or phone being broken.; , Most areas have local resources to help victims of abuse. If you are not sure where to start or if you want to talk to someone about planning to leave an abusive relationship, begin with the following resources.   In the US: National Domestic Violence Hotline 1-800-799-7233(SAFE)  Men in the US can contact The Domestic Abuse Helpline for Men and Women   In the UK: Women’s Aid 0808 2000 247  Men in the UK can contact ManKind Initiative    In Australia: 1800Respect 1800 737 732  Men in Australia can contact One in Three    Worldwide: The International Directory of Domestic Violence Agencies   , If you are a woman who is a victim of abuse, find a battered women’s shelter in your area (or a nearby town). Be aware that the physical location of such shelters is usually kept secret for the protection of the women in the shelter, but you should be able to call a hotline or go through a screening in a physical location. Then you will be referred to the shelter.Most shelters allow for a safe place to live for both women and children. They are designed to offer safety and support while you get back on your feet, but your stay there will be for a limited amount of time., This often leads victims to believe that they have no one to help them escape their abuser. However, friends and family, even if you have been out of touch, may pull through and help you get out of a bad situation. Reach out to someone you trust and ask for help.   Try to be specific with what you would like for them to do for you (such as let you stay with them, keep your “escape bag,” call the police for you if you give them a “code word,” etc.)  

find a secure means of seeking help.  contact an organization that can help.  find a battered women’s shelter.  talk to friends or family.unfortunately, many victims of abuse withdraw or are forced to become isolated. 

 It'll be easier to get a task done if you have all the supplies on hand to do it. Avoid wasting time looking for tools or documents by having them all accessible and organized from the beginning.; , Even though you may just want to do this in your head, actually writing it down has a huge impact.   Try to be specific and reasonable. For example, don't write 'continue novel' or 'clean house.' Instead, write things such as 'write 500 words' or 'tidy the living room floor.' Small, achievable tasks are best. If you have a big goal in mind, try breaking it down into smaller steps on your list.       Don't get too distracted by the list. If list-making is taking more time than just getting down to work, put it aside and start being productive.       If tasks have a deadline, mark them on. This will help you in prioritizing.        Prioritize the tasks. A simple numbering system works well - you can decide to either prioritize the tasks that need to get done first, or get particularly hard/long tasks out of the way first. Alternative, you might even opt to start with a few shorter/easier tasks so that you can knock a few off the list quickly.    Shed light on the situation. If it is day, open the curtains. If it is night, turn on the brightest lights. This will have a psychological impact on you.       List all the advantages of completing the goal you have. Come up with as many things as you can. For example, if your goal is to make friends with a colleague, don't just say 'I will have a new friend.' Instead, advantages can include: I can meet people from their social circles; Our work can be more enjoyable; We can learn from each other; They may encourage me on days when I feel demotivated etc.       Tell people when you will be finished by. This is a very powerful tool for getting things done as it increases the pressure on you. Tell as many people as you can and emphasize how good your finished thing shall be.       Set rewards for yourself.       Open the windows if you can to let in fresh air.  Some people prefer to work in silence; others like to have music on. Also, find what type of music is best. While most find relaxing, gentle music best for homework, college assignments, etc; others don't. Most people find that the type of music varies from task to task (e.g. fast music for cleaning or relaxing music for paperwork).   Remember that you may not be able to play music for the task. For example, you may not be allowed to play music at work/school.       Try not to play music that you will be tempted to sing along with.  Distractions can include phones, emails, social media, family etc. Whatever is deterring you from working needs to be removed. If you are being distracted every 15 minutes, you will get little work done because it is impossible to get immediately back to work after a distraction. For most people this takes 5 - 10 minutes.   Consider letting your family members, coworkers/classmates, or housemates know that you're buckling down to work on something important, so that they won't distract you.  Many people believe that multitasking increases productivity, but the truth is tackling things one at a time will allow you to complete more in less time.   Break tasks into smaller chunks if needed. One huge job can seem overwhelming, but if you break it down into sections, it becomes more manageable. For example, "write an essay" seems big, but if you start with "brainstorm ideas" and "write a topic sentence," each part becomes a much smaller and more achievable goal. As you do each task, check it off your to-do list. This feels great, and can motivate you to keep going down the list.  The breaks should be no longer then 8-10 minutes. During this time you should stretch and exercise a bit. This will help you come back to the task with more focus, and keep at it for a longer period of time overall.  In particular, drink lots of water. Your brain and body can only work properly if you are hydrated. While drinks and snacks can be distracting, they also help keep your energy up. If you're thirst or hungry, don't ignore these feelings - take care of them, and get back to work.  This may seem tedious, but a tidy space means a tidy mind.  This shouldn't be a problem if you've already removed the main distractions before beginning work, but if you hear your phone ring, or get a Facebook alert, ask yourself: is it worth breaking my work flow? If there's something urgent you need to take care of, do, but if it's something you can take care of later, wait for your break.  If you lose site of why you're working so hard, look back at your to-do list and try to refocus on your motivation. If needed, taking a few moments to re-adjust your mindset like this will help you stay on task.  Give yourself the rewards you had promised yourself. Be honest with yourself - if you do not complete the task, do not reward yourself.  

keep possessions organized.  make a list of all things that need to be done for the day, week, and month.  find motivation.  find out if music works for you.  remove distractions.  do things one at a time.  take short breaks every hour.  eat and drink as needed.  keep your workspace tidy.  resist distractions.  remind yourself of the goals and rewards.  reward yourself for a job well done. 

 If you are left handed, reverse the handedness of the instructions.; , Put the string under the axle (the metal bit).  Then roll it over to the left or just back and forth, and lift the sticks into the air when it reaches the foot. This gives the diabolo initial rotational momentum that stabilizes it when you lift it into the air.  Try to imagine cutting a carrot with a kitchen knife. Try to keep this up as long as possible without the diabolo falling off.  Do not fret; this is easily controlled. If the diabolo is tilting towards you, move your right hand forward. If it is tilting away from you, move your right hand back. Do this while continuing to move the right stick up and down. This works by pushing against the top of the diabolo with the string.  Until then, you can rectify the balance of the diabolo by moving the right stick it the opposite direction diabolo is leaning. For example, if it's leaning forward, bring the stick backwards.  This is done by simply pulling the two hand sticks apart rapidly, causing the diabolo to fly up. To catch, simply position the string underneath the axle of the diabolo.  

if you are right-handed, follow the instructions precisely.  place the diabolo down on the ground directly in front of you.  roll the diabolo over to your right foot, and let it stop.  before it stops spinning, move the right stick up and down in a "hitting" motion.  the diabolo will naturally tilt away from or toward you.  the diabolo naturally tends to unbalance until you learn to keep it at consistent high speeds.  when you can keep the diabolo level and with reasonable speed, try learning to throw and catch it. 

 Helicobacter comes from the Ancient Greek ἕλιξ (hélix) meaning 'something twisted or spiral', and βακτήριον (baktḗrion), rod. Pylori comes from the Ancient Greek word for gatekeeper: πυλωρός (pylorus).  Helico-bacter pylori , It is pronounced as Hee-lee-koh, with the stress on the first syllable., Pronounce Bèk-ter, with the stress on the first syllable., Pronounce it as Pai-loh-ree, with the stress on the second syllable., Hee-lee-koh-bèk-ter pai-loh-ree., 

understand the words' origins.  split the word in easy to pronounce parts.  start with helico.  follow with bacter.  end with pylori.  say the whole name slowly.practice until you can say it without hesitations. 

 Take the four ripe tomatoes and place them in a bowl. Pour in boiling hot water until it covers the tomatoes. This will start to tear the skins for peeling. After 2-4 minutes, take them out and dry them.; , Make sure there is not a trace of skin left. Chop up the tomatoes into very small, cube-shaped pieces and add into a different bowl.  Stir until combined. Pour this mixture into the main bowl with the tomatoes.  Make sure the tomatoes are coated well. Transfer to a small side serving dish. Place in the fridge to cool for an hour. Take out and enjoy immediately!  , 

gather your ingredients mentioned in the 'ingredients' section at the top of this article.  start to peel the skins off.  add together the lemon juice, olive oil and balsamic and chili in a smaller bowl or cup.  stir all of your ingredients together.  finished.  

 Lacquer, even more so than paint and primer, gives off dangerous fumes that can be deadly in enclosed spaces. Unless you have a designated spray booth, you should spray your lacquer outside.You'll want a sturdy, level surface to work on, and a surrounding area free of unnecessary equipment or tripping hazards.   You can make a temporary work bench on level ground outside your home. Lay a flat board between two sawhorses, and you'll be ready to start lacquering. You may still want to drape a large drop cloth over the surrounding area to protect accidental lacquer spatter on your house or lawn furniture., Set your goal board on your work surface. For the best results, you should prime your board before painting it. Use medium grit sandpaper (60 - 100 rating) for rough wood, fine grit paper (120 - 220 rating) for relatively smooth wood, and very fine paper (240 - 400) for smooth, unblemished wood.When sanding, use moderate, steady pressure to rub the sandpaper back and forth with the grain of the wood, smoothing blemishes, splinters, and so on. Sand your goal board until it is completely smooth and even. Then, wipe away sawdust with a water dampened rag. You can speed the sanding process considerably by using an automated sander, like an orbital sander. Be sure to wear a dust mask and protective eye wear when using automated sanders., At this point, you'll need to allow a few minutes for the wood to dry following its damp wipe down. This is the perfect opportunity to check and put on your safety gear for lacquering. You'll need:   Dust maskSafety googles Gloves, Depending on the kind of lacquer primer you bought, there are several methods by which you might apply it. Many kinds can be brushed onto your board to improve the quality of your lacquer. Always follow your lacquer primer directions, but generally:   Mix the lacquer primer with a clean paint stirrer. Then dip a clean brush into the lacquer and wipe excess primer off onto the inner lip of its can. Apply the lacquer in thin layers with long, even, overlapping strokes. Prime from the top to the bottom, and target cracks and joints, which can be difficult to prime. Wait the required time between coats, indicated in the label instructions of your primer, then apply another coat in the same fashion. Apply three to five coats total., Depending on the kind of lacquer you have purchased, your method of application will vary. Many lacquers, however, use a spray applicators. Always follow your lacquer instructions, but for spray applicator lacquers, generally:   Shake the can for 5 to 10 minutes. Hold it so the spray nozzle is 10 - 18" (25.4 - 45.7 cm) from the surface you are going to lacquer. Press the spray button down to emit the spray lacquer. Apply it in short, smooth, horizontal strokes. It may take some trial and error before you achieve the correct spray distance. Dimpling in the finish is cause by excess distance. Streaking occurs when you apply lacquer too close to the wood., The wait time between coats of lacquer will be different depending on the lacquer you have used. Follow your lacquer's label instructions for best results. When your lacquer is ready for another coat:Sand the entire lacquered surface of your board lightly with very fine (240 - 400 rating) sandpaper. Wipe dust free of your board with a clean rag or tack cloth. Pay special attention to edges and joints, where fine dust may have built up. Apply a second layer of lacquer in the same fashion as previously described. Repeat this process until your lacquer has at least three to five coats.  After your final layer of lacquer has dried, it's time for you to bring out its shine. You can do this by lightly buffing it with a 0000 rated piece of steel wool. Then wipe the surfaces of your board with a clean, dry cloth, and use a suitable wax to really make it sparkle. 

select a safe work area.  prepare the wood for lacquering.  put on proper safety equipment before lacquering.  apply lacquer primer to the goal board.  lacquer the goal board.  add several coats of lacquer.  buff the lacquered surface of your board. 

 When you are packing, you can't pack long before the trip because you need most of that everyday stuff. Make a packing checklist, here's an example of one:   1 or 2 shirts plus the one they wear on the way to your destination 1 or 2 pairs of pants including what you are wearing a few pairs of underwear, socks, bras sneakers diapers, baby wipes, pads, deodorant, hairbrushes, toothbrushes, etc activities for the car ride or in case you get bored medicines comfort items; , One or two days before the trip, you can pack clothes and maybe some entertainment items. The morning of the trip you can pack the rest like hygiene things.  This is also a great time for them to have o clean out their backpacks! If you have any toddlers who are not in school yet, get them a backpack or travel backpack so they can also carry their own things in there. If you don't have a lot of room and feel like you can't have all the kids bring individual bags, then have a few big bags, or suitcases not for clothes but for the things listed like at the beginning of this step.  Some people say travel during nighttime or during kids nap times but it doesn't make much of a difference either way.  Make sure they don't get too sweaty though because otherwise they will be uncomfortable. Also make sure everyone has gone to the bathroom. Before you leave, go through the luggage once more to make sure you haven't forgotten anything.  Also brinks snacks and some drinks. But make planned bathroom stops so that the kids can know when they should have their drinks so they won't have to hold it for a while. Some entertainment items that kids can bring are iPods/mp3 players, portable DVD players if you have one, books and magazines, snacks will definitely keep them busy too. You can also play easy games that don't have a lot of pieces. You can play car games like each person decides a color and they count how many cars drive by that are that color. There are many other games you can play that I will explain down in the tips and anyone else is welcome to add any games that they know of. , The kids will really need to cooperate. Also tell them what will happen while you are there. It is their house so you won't be able to have too much control over what happens and the way you do things. When putting the kids to bed, do the same routine that happens at your house, like if you read a story to them, make sure to do that. Have them do whatever they usually do to get ready for bed.  Tell them what will happen while you are there Bring swimsuits because there will probably be a pool See what amenities the hotel has If the kids are bored or don't want to be in a small hotel room then go outside, get some air, take a walk. Do the same bedtime routine that you usually do with your kids at home.  

be organized.  do some packing one or two days before the trip and the rest the morning of the trip.  have the kids empty out their school backpacks and have them pack their entertainment things, comfort items, and their hygiene things like hairbrushes, toothbrushes, etc in their backpack.  consider the travel time.  before you leave the house, make sure everyone has gotten some energy out like maybe tell them to go outside for 10-15 minutes and run around this way they hopefully will not mind sitting for a little while.  for the car ride, have the kids sit with their bags close to them so they won't be climbing around trying to get their things.  have the kids dress in the same colors so it is easier for you to keep track of them.  ,  if you are staying at someone else's house with them:  bring them a gift for being your hosts  before you get there, explain to your kids what you expect of them while you are at their house.  if you are staying at a hotel,  tell the kids what you expect of them while you're there. 

 Most J-1 visas are privately sponsored. The purpose of the program is to let individuals learn about U.S. culture while studying or working. The more common categories include the following:Interns. A student or recent college graduate can intern with a U.S. business to learn more about the business culture and U.S. culture generally. Trainees.

Describe what you are currently doing. Where will you live in the U.S.? What program are you applying to and when did you apply?  , At your interview, you must show the consular official that you intend to return to your home country after your visit to the U.S. You must show that you have strong ties to your home.There are different ways to show these ties to your home country, depending on your circumstances.   For example, if you are a student, you can explain how the education you receive in the U.S. will help you get a job or start a business in your home country.You can also show that you own property in your home country which you intend to return to. You might also discuss relationships you have in your home country, with elderly parents, for example.  You also need to show the consular official that you can support yourself while in the U.S. For example, you may need to show bank accounts or a letter from a family member promising to support you.   Applicants will typically need to give an ink-free scan of their fingerprints.You will usually give the fingerprint during your interview. If you are approved, you’ll receive a visa foil in your passport. Many applicants will receive the visa foil on the same day as their interview.Your visa is valid until it expires. However, some people might need more administrative processing, which can extend the process another 60 days. As part of the processing, you may need to provide additional information.

 You can buy the console from Nintendo, or from any number of online stores. Enter 'Buy Nintendo DS' into an internet search and you will find a bunch of options to buy from. Prices range anywhere from $20.00 to $60.00 depending on if you are buying the console new, used, or refurbished.  Some classic Nintendo series and characters include Donkey Kong, the Legend of Zelda, Mario Kart, Mario Party, and Mario World. If you have no idea what kind of game you want to play, starting with one of these could be a good bet. Everyone else seemed to like them and you might too!, Before you use the Nintendo DS for the first time, the battery must be fully charged. To do this, you'll want to find the power adapter in the package that your Nintendo DS came in. It should be labeled as the power adapter. Take the small end of the adapter and plug it into the plug at the back of your Nintendo DS labeled 5.2v ln. On the other end of the adapter, swing the prongs out of adapter until they lock into place. Now you can go ahead and insert the adapter into a normal 120 volt wall plug. Once the system begins to charge, an orange light will turn on. Once it is fully charged it will go off and that's how you will know you are ready to play. Always unplug the adapter from the wall before unplugging it from the Nintendo DS. Your battery is good for at least 500 full charges before it starts losing steam. Keep that in mind for future reference.  

buy a nintendo ds.  buy the games you want to play.  charge the system. 

 This is a very similar method to the previous one. You are basically aiming to get your opponent's Bishop and Knight Pawns forward one and two squares respectively, while freeing your Queen to enable it to move onto h5. The end result is the same as the previous method.          You are trying to tempt your opponent to move her Bishop and Knight Pawns. You need you opponent to respond by bringing out her Bishop Pawn one square to f6. It can also work if she moves her Knight Pawn forward two squares on this turn, as long as she moves the Bishop Pawn on her next move.  The next move for you to make has to free up your Queen so it can get into a checkmate position on the next move. To do this, move the White King Pawn ahead two squares to e4. Now you have opened up an avenue for your Queen to reach h5.          In order to clear the way to your opponent's King you need her to move her Knight Pawn ahead two spaces to g5.  Checkmate! And that's it, you have trapped your opponent's King in the same position as the previous method, but this time you did it without even capturing a single piece. Game. Set. Match. Over.         Again, this looks simple and it is. So don't expect it to work very often! In theory, there are loads of variations on this. The key moves are getting your Queen to h5, and your opponent's Bishop and Knight Pawns out of the way of her King.  

move your king pawn to d3.  move your queen pawn forward to e4.  move the white queen to h5 (qh5). 

 Use a pencil, dowel, stick, or chopstick to push the items about until they are positioned the way you want. Be careful not to overfill it, however. Also, note that these items won't add fragrance to your candle. If you want, consider matching the decorations to the season. For example:   Fall: orange slices, cinnamon sticks, star anise, or brightly colored leaves. Winter: mini pinecones, twigs, pine branches, or holly leaves and berries. Summer: orange, lemon, and lime slices. Spring: Whole flowers, such as dahlia or daisies.  If you want, you can add a few drops of food coloring into the water for a special effect., Light olive oil and sunflower seed oil are great, because they burn clean.You can also use just about any other type of oil meant for cooking or burning in lamps.   Consider mixing some essential oils into your vegetable oil first. Lemon, rosemary, and sweet orange are all great choices., Purchase your floating wick from a store or online. Next, take one of the wicks, and push it half-way through one of the waxed disks., The candle will burn for about 2 hours. When you want to extinguish it, simply place the jar lid on top. Eventually, the wick will burn completely. When that happens, simply insert a new one; the waxed disks can last much longer, and do not need to be replaced as often.Fresh fruit and flowers will last about 1 week in the water. If you want something that lasts longer, use fake flowers. Some craft stores also sell fake fruit. 

fill your mason jar with natural, decorative items, such as cinnamon sticks and pinecones.  fill the jar with water until it is 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) from the rim.  pour in a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) layer of vegetable oil.  assemble your floating wick.  place the floating wick on top of the oil layer, and light it. 

 Do this a couple of times and each time use your outline less and less.; , As you become familiar with the flow of your speech this will become easier. These should be key words that help you to remember the flow of the speech. Don't memorize the speech but memorize the flow.  If you are using any visual aids incorporate those as well.  When practicing, time yourself to make sure that you are near your time goal. At this point, your presentation should be a little too long (couple minutes or so for a ten minute speech) because when you actually present you will go faster than when you practice (This will not happen as much as you gain experience).  This will allow you to get a realistic picture in your head as to what your presentation will look like. Bring some friends along to listen as well. Feedback is always good.  You don't want your presentation to look rehearsed, it should be very natural and conversational, so don't practice too much.  You want to be refreshed when it comes time to present!  , You don't want your stomach rumbling, but you also don't want to be groggy.  The tips below should help you to deal with your nervousness. Remember though, a little bit of nerves is good, it will help you to present excitedly and passionately.  

practice your speech using your outline.  condense your outline into fifteen words that you can put on your note card.  practice your speech using your note card.  time yourself.  recreate the location where you will give your speech and practice there, as realistically as possible.  don't overdo it!,  get a good night's sleep.  eat a good meal, but don't overeat.  deal with those nerves. 

 There are several types of endocrine disorders that can impact your dog's hair and skin. These include disorders of the thyroid gland, adrenal gland, and the pituitary gland.Skin and hair problems are also often caused by allergies. If your dog is having issues with its skin and hair, you should consult with a veterinarian about possible causes and solutions.; , Endocrine disorders can cause both weight loss and weight gain, depending on what type of disorder your dog has. Problems with the thyroid gland and the adrenal gland can cause your dog to either gain or lose weight. Problems in the pancreas can cause your dog to lose weight.In order to assess whether your dog has lost or gained weight, it's a good idea to have an idea of how much your dog weighs normally. If you know how much the dog weighs on an average day you can easily weigh it to see if it has lost weight.  While weakness and lethargy can be caused by a wide variety of illnesses, they can be associated with endocrine disorders as well. Pay attention to your dog's energy level and take note if its energy level drops.   Lethargy and weakness are associated with endocrine disorders in the pancreas, adrenal gland, and the thyroid gland., Endocrine disorders can also cause problems in your dog's digestive system. This usually means your dog will have repeated episodes of vomiting or diarrhea, or both. It may also mean that your dog has less interest in eating than usual because it is not feeling well.   Digestive distress can be associated with a wide variety of illnesses. In the case of endocrine disorders, it is usually associated with problems in the pancreas, adrenal gland, or the thyroid gland., If your dog has symptoms that you think could be connected to an endocrine disorder then you should have it looked at by a veterinarian. Call your veterinary office and tell them about your dog's symptoms. They will schedule an appointment for you to bring your dog in.   If your dog is having severe symptoms and you are worried about its survival then you should bring your dog to a veterinarian right away. Call the veterinary office on your way in so that they can prepare for your arrival but don't wait for an open appointment if your dog is gravely ill.  When you bring your dog in to see a veterinarian, they are likely to ask you a variety of questions about your dog's condition. Give the vet as much information as you can in order to assist them in coming to a thorough diagnosis for your dog.   Keep track of your dog's symptoms, even consider writing them down, so that you can tell your veterinarian exactly when you first noticed them and how they have progressed.  Once your veterinarian has done a thorough physical exam of your dog and has discussed its symptoms with you, he or she may want to do additional testing to figure out what exactly is wrong with the dog. Approve these tests so that your veterinarian can get to the bottom of what is making your dog ill.   Testing usually begins with a general blood count and urinalysis. If any levels look off during these tests, then the vet can do follow up tests to narrow down the cause. Once a veterinarian suspects a specific glandular problem, they can do specific tests on that gland's function. For example, if your veterinarian suspects a problem with the thyroid then he or she is likely to do a series of thyroid function tests, testing for T4 and TSH levels., Once your veterinarian figures out what they think is wrong with your dog, they will discuss the problem with you. They will also discuss the treatment and prognosis with you as well. Feel free to ask questions if you don't understand what they are telling you at first.   Take notes if you have a hard time remembering details. This will help you to treat and care for your dog later on. Make sure that your vet is taking your dog's age into consideration when discussing treatment. You will need to weigh your dog's age and physical stamina against the treatment options your veterinarian presents.  Medication can often be used to treat endocrine disorders that produce too much hormone. Syndromes that are caused by hormone deficiency are often treated by replacing the missing hormone. The most common example of this type of treatment is insulin injections that are used to treat diabetes. Medications used for endocrine disorders are sometimes injected, as in the case of insulin, but are often given orally. This is the case for steroid and thyroid hormone replacements. Medications are often a good treatment option for senior dogs, as undergoing more invasive types of treatment could be too much for their aging bodies.  If your dog has an endocrine disorder that causes too much hormone to be released then surgery to remove the malfunctioning gland may be one of the treatment options.For example, endocrine problems that are caused by tumors or tissue malformation may require surgery to correct.   Surgery can be very hard on senior dogs. You will need to discuss your dog's health and whether or not your vet thinks the dog can physically handle surgery before committing to this treatment. Some senior dogs, depending on their age and condition, are better off living out their days on medication than undergoing surgery even though the surgery could potentially eliminate the problem.  Radiotherapy is extremely rare as a means of treating endocrine disease in dogs. A medical or surgical intervention is much more likely. However, if your dog has an endocrine disorder that causes too much hormone to be released then it may be able to be treated with radiotherapy. This type of treatment uses radiation to eliminate tissues that are malfunctioning.For example, radioactive iodine can be used to eliminate an overactive thyroid. In many cases, radiotherapy is used on glands that cannot be surgically removed due to location or other restrictions. 

look for skin problems or hair loss.  identify changes in weight.  pay attention to weakness and lethargy.  take note of digestive distress.  take your dog to a veterinarian.  give the veterinarian as much information as possible.  approve blood and urine testing, as well as imaging.  discuss the diagnosis with your veterinarian.  give your dog medication.  schedule your dog for surgery.  have your dog undergo radiotherapy. 

 It's best to do so when the car is stopped on a level surface, with the engine cold.; , On most cars with hydraulic clutches, the clutch fluid reservoir is located near the brake master cylinder at the back of the engine bay but is smaller than the brake fluid reservoir. If in doubt as to where to look, consult with your car's owner's manual.  The reservoir should either be filled to the top, or filled to between the minimum and maximum lines shown on the reservoir, depending on the car in question. On most newer cars, the reservoir will be made of translucent plastic, while older cars may have metal reservoirs, requiring you to remove the reservoir cap before you can see the fluid level.  Pour the fluid carefully into the reservoir, wiping up any spills.   Hydraulic clutches use the same type of fluid as hydraulic brake systems. Use the fluid with the DOT specification recommended in your car's owner's manual.  Be sure the gasket on the cap seats correctly.  

open the car's hood.  look for the clutch fluid reservoir.  check the fluid level in the reservoir.  add fluid to the reservoir.  replace the reservoir cap and close the hood. 

 Metals are typically shiny and malleable. They often have loosely bound electrons. That means that they have weaker electronegativity than many nonmetals. This allows metals to “give” some of their electrons to nonmetals, resulting in a dipole.A dipole is when a bond has a positive and negative charge at either end. The presence of a dipole indicates a polar bond.; , Non metals are usually hard and brittle, and lack luster (shine). They often have a greater electronegativity than metals. This means that they can “take” the electrons from the metal atoms to which they are bound. This will create a dipole in the bond., The valence electrons of an atom are the ones that reside in its outer shell. For the most part, atoms follow the octet rule, meaning that eight valence electrons will create the most stable configuration. Atoms with nearly eight are likely to “take” other electrons, while atoms with only one or two valence electrons are likely to “give” up their outer electrons.For example, sodium (Na) has one valence electron, and chlorine (Cl) has seven. When they bond, they form the salt sodium chloride (NaCl) because the sodium gives up its one valence electron and the chlorine accepts it. This is a polar bond.  

identify any metals.  note any non metals.  consider valence electrons for each atom. 

 Examine the boot and determine where the widest part of the shaft lies. More often than not, the widest part will be at the opening of the boot, but this is not always the case.   Note that boot shaft circumference is sometimes referred to as “circumference” or “calf circumference.”  , Place the end of a tape measure at a point along the widest part of the shaft. Wrap the rest of the tape measure around the shaft until it meets the starting end. Read the tape measure at the point of intersection to determine the shaft circumference.   Make sure that the tape measure is parallel to the ground the entire way around the shaft of the boot. If the tape measure is not even or straight, the measurement can get significantly thrown off. As with shaft height, shaft circumference is often measured in inches when discussing boot sizes in the United States.  

identify the widest part of the boot shaft.  measure around this part of the boot shaft. 

 Do so by tapping the grey gear icon that's on one of your Home screens or in a folder named "Utilities."; , It's in the third group of options. , It should turn grey, meaning that Night Shift will no longer automatically enable or disable itself.   If this switch is already grey, skip this step.  It will turn green, and your display will shift to a softer brown color.  

open your iphone's settings.  tap display & brightness.  select night shift.  ,  slide the scheduled switch left to the "off" position.  slide the manually enable until tomorrow switch right to the "on" position. 

 Don’t spend time worrying about what makes you metal and others not metal. Why waste time judging others when you can be enjoying the company of friends or discovering new bands?   Many metal fans claim to feel like outsiders in the regular world, but to feel welcome and happy in the metal community. If you make people feel unwelcome, chances are you’re the one who’ll end up getting shunned.; , A lot of metal fans fit the stereotypical image of having long hair, wearing band shirts and baggy pants, and violently dancing to their favorite tunes, but just as many metal fans look like “regular” people.   If you’re a metalhead, chances are the music will inspire your personal style, but that doesn’t mean you have to look like a metalhead just to fit in with your community.  True metalheads live their lives according to a philosophy taught by the music they love. This could vary depending on their favorite bands, but if you’re a metalhead, the music will be part of your moral fabric.  Let metal inspire you to discover who you are as a person. Use the songs to explore your feelings and ideas. Let the music inform your decisions, but don’t let it make them for you.   A lot of the lyrics of metal songs can be violent and self-destructive, but that doesn’t mean you need to be. There’s often a deeper meaning, so seek it out before you make poor life choices. As an example, the song “Suicide Solution” was once cited in a court case as causing a teenager to commit suicide, but the artist (Ozzy Osbourne) argued that the teenager had misinterpreted his lyrics., Many people claim that most metal is fantasy regardless the subgenre. This is because it explores reality through a lens that reaches beyond the things we see every day.   This might be more obvious with a band like Rhapsody, but fantasy (albeit horror fantasy) is also explored in Cannibal Corpse lyrics and album art., A lot of metalheads claim to be nerdy. Some regularly play role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons. Some claim to be obsessed with video games and fantasy fiction. Others claim to be passionate about composing and producing music.Regardless of the genre, metal is generally quite intricate and complex music. It invites repeat listening and obsessive attention.  Invest in high-quality sound equipment. Metal is complex music that is best heard on a sound system that can handle it. Try out your favorite songs on various stereo systems before deciding on what you like best.   In addition to purchasing a good sound system, you’ll also want to treat your records and CDs with care. If you have any rare recordings, be sure that you back them up., A lot of people have a fixed idea of metal but don't actually know what it’s about. Try not to get offended when they immediately assume you’re a Satanist or deranged in some way.   Metalheads are some of the most sensitive, happy, and friendly people you’ll meet. Don’t let a few ignorant people change that!  , Metalheads are no different from other types of fans in that they value trivia. If you haven’t already done so, read up on the history of metal. This will also help you discover new bands and figure out which subgenres of metal are your favorite.   A topic that often comes up in discussions of metal is “Who was the first metal band?” The most popular answer seems to be Black Sabbath, the first band to play “the Devil’s Chord”, but people also argue for Blue Cheer, Dennis Edmonton/Mars Bonfire, and Alice Cooper, among others., There are an overwhelming number of metal subgenres, and these will differ depending on who you talk to. Knowing the types of metal will help you explore your tastes and broaden your horizons.   Some subgenres include power metal, progressive metal, stoner metal, glam metal, thrash metal, stoner core, black metal, Norwegian black metal, Swedish death metal, goth metal, industrial metal, new wave American metal, folk metal, viking metal — the list goes on indefinitely., If you spend time in the metal community you’ll likely hear various labels for types of metal fans. Some labels include Hessians, Bangers, Metallians, and Death Rockers.It’s better to get to know a person than to base your opinion on a stereotype, but knowing what the labels mean can still broaden your knowledge of metal.  For the most part this is common sense, but it becomes particularly important if you’re planning to be in the mosh pit — which is likely if you’re a metalhead. If you’re going to be in the mosh pit, here are some considerations:   Wear sturdy shoes and clothes. Don’t wear anything that can be easily wrecked. Don’t wear anything that is super important to you, which you’d be sad to lose or have destroyed. Minimize. Only wear and bring what you absolutely need. If you can avoid it, don’t wear glasses. If you have a wallet and keys, attach them with a chain or leave them with a friend who isn’t going to be in the mosh pit. Leave the phone at home if possible. This isn’t just for your safety; it’s for the safety of others too, who could be hit by your flying items.  Also called the horned hand or the Mano Cornuto, this hand gesture was made popular by the famous metal vocalist, Ronnie James Dio. It involves making a fist with your hand, but leaving your pointer and pinky fingers pointing upwards.When doing devil horns, make sure your thumbs aren’t sticking out.  If you want to look like a stereotypical metalhead, you’ll need to rock metal shirts. If you wear a tour shirt, make sure that it’s from a show you’ve actually been to. Many fans look down on wearing shirts from tours you haven’t actually attended.   It’s kind of immature, but a lot of metal fans look down on wearing shirts of the bands whose concerts you are at. For instance, you wouldn’t wear an Arch Enemy shirt to an Arch Enemy concert.  Denim vests and leather jackets covered in patches are popular in the metal community. If this is part of your style, be sure to buy and sew on the patches yourself. Pre-patched clothes are looked down upon.  Boots are another popular item worn by metalheads. If you go to a lot of shows (and if you’re a true metalhead, you probably do), you might want to invest in a pair of steel-toed boots to protect your feet in the mosh pit!  , Arm and wrist cuffs are popular metalhead accessories. The type you wear might depend on the type of music you listen to.   If you’re into folk metal you might be more likely to wear a forearm cuff of embossed leather. A viking metal fan might wear a traditional metal viking bracelet. If you’re into goth or black metal you might wear something a bit more dangerous looking, with spikes or long nails protruding from it.  Metal fans have all sorts of hairstyles. The main reason for growing your hair long is that it can make it more fun to head-bang, particularly since it makes the head-banging look more dramatic.  

don’t be judgmental.  be yourself.  live by the music.  read between the lines.  recognize the fantasy.  get nerdy.  honor the sound.  fight ignorance.  know your history.  know the subgenres.  familiarize yourself with the labels, then forget them.  learn concert etiquette.  perfect your devil horns.  wear metal shirts.  sew those patches on.  wear boots.  accessorize.  grow your hair long.

 A quiet place with a suitable environment. Whether it is your room or a library, choose an atmosphere that is silent & free of distractions in order to concentrate. It should be away from the TV, pets, and anything else that spells for an easy distraction. What's more, you want a comfy chair and good lighting. There should be no strain on your back, neck, or eyes – pain is also a distraction.   For example, do not study right in front of a TV; you will only do your homework when the advertisements come up. Go to get a "snip" of TV or radio only as a quick break – exactly as if it's a few moments to go to get a drink of water or "fresh air" for a minute. Sit in a chair at a table or desk while you study. Don't study in bed, except maybe reading on top of your covers, propped upright with a bright reading light behind you. However, don't get under the covers – you'll just want to fall asleep. What's more, you'll start to associate your bedroom with studying and that's definitely an impulse you want to avoid. A standing desk does a remarkable job making you focus on your task (in addition to being a healthier option to sitting).; , Your pencils and pens, highlighters and books should be within your reach so that you are not distracted while studying. Organize the area, if need be, so the clutter doesn't clutter your mind. There should be no reason you have to get up, interrupting you from being "in the zone."   Even if you're not sure you'll need it, it should be in your "study area." All the textbooks, notebooks, and papers you need (remember that syllabus) should be within arm's reach. This is quite literally a set-up for success. Use your laptop if it is necessary for your studies otherwise keep your laptop away from you.  Try to keep it to something simple that you can repeat, like a few nuts, blueberries/strawberries, 1/4 an apple, or break off a piece of a dark chocolate bar. Keep water nearby, too – don't drink too much coffee, caffeinated teas, or any energy drinks (you'll be up all night long). They inevitably lead to a crash that makes you feel dead-tired – and pinching and slapping won't fix it.   Looking for some "super-foods?" Research shows that blueberries, spinach, squash, broccoli, dark chocolate, and fish are all brain-boosting foods that can help you get your study on.  For just today, what do you want (or need) to get accomplished? What should you do to be able to walk away feeling like you've done all you needed to do? These are your goals, and it will give you something to work toward during your study time.   Make sure they're doable. If you have to read 100 pages this week, break it down to 20 pages a day – don't bite off more than you can chew. Keep in mind your time constraints as well. If you only have one free hour tonight, do the most important thing to get done?  , This will help you avoid temptations to be off-task and allow you to stay on your plan. Only use your computer, if you need it for your studies; otherwise, it's just an unnecessary risk. As for your phone – put it in airplane mode unless you need it on for an emergency.   There are website and software blockers like SelfRestraint, SelfControl, and Think that can keep you away from the websites and software that are the hardest to resist.Understand yourself and whether you need Facebook to be blocked for the next hour or so. Don't worry – it'll come back.  For some people, music helps them concentrate. For some, it doesn't. Try it out and see what works best for you. A little something in the background can make you forget that you're just studying instead of out having fun.   Keep in mind that the music that's right for you to study to may not be the music you traditionally like. Traditionally music that you don't know is better because recognising a song makes your mind wonder or even sing to it. Experiment with listening to other genres to see whether there's something you enjoy but can easily tune in and out. Try to use a background noise generator that plays natural sounds such as bird chirping, rain, river stream or other pleasant sounds in order to help you study. There are several free tools available online.  If you have a long night of studying ahead of you, make a plan for the day. Aim to work for 30-60 minute periods with 5-10 minute breaks in between. Your brain needs the break to recharge. It's not laziness – it's letting your brain synthesize the information.Try to switch subjects every hour or so, too, to prevent yourself from getting bored and saturating your mind. Too much of one subject and your brain will start going on autopilot. A new subject will wake up your mind and your motivation.  Sometimes it's hard to study because the real world keeps creeping into our minds, good or bad. We feel like we don't have control over our thoughts, but we do. Tell yourself that you'll think about that problem or that girl or boy when you're finished. You'll feel a bit of solace knowing you'll get to it eventually. And when the time comes, the urge may have actually passed.   If you start to feel your mind wander, stop it dead in its tracks. Take a second to shake it off, and then resume with the material. You are the ringleader of your thoughts. You started them, and you can stop them, too! Keep pen and paper besides you and write down everything that comes to your mind during your study sessions. Do or think about those things once you're having a pause.  Let's say you just got done reading 20 pages of a textbook. The last thing you should jump into is 20 pages of the next textbook. Instead, do a quiz with some flashcards. Make a few charts to help you remember those economics stats. Listen to those French tapes. Do some studying that involves different skills and different sections of your brain. Point blank, you'll be less bored.   And it'll be easier for your brain to process, too. Switching up what skills you're using helps you brain process the information faster and hold onto it. The time will go faster and you'll remember it better? Check and check.  Sometimes we need a little pick-me-up to keep ourselves going. If the good grades aren't enough of a reward, create something else to keep you concentrated on your studies. Maybe some sweet treats and some noshing time in front of the TV? A shopping spree? A massage or a nap? What would make studying worth your while?   If possible, get your parents involved. Could they help supply you with incentive? Maybe getting better grades could get you out of your least favourite chore or could temporarily up your allowance. Ask them whether they're willing to help work out some type of reward plan – it never hurts to ask.  Have you ever been handled a pile of paperwork and wanted to fill it out, but you just didn't know what some of it meant? That can be what studying is like sometimes. Recognize when you need to go back and make it simpler. If you don't know the basics, don't try to tackle the content. Parse it out first.   When a question comes up saying, "What was George Washington's stance on the Boston Tea Party?" it'll help to know who George Washington is. Figure that out and then move onto the content at hand.  Teachers know it, but they'll rarely say it: reading can get boring, especially when it's in a topic you don't enjoy. To make your studying more effective and to make it easier to concentrate, use active reading techniques. This'll keep your brain from wandering and make sure your grades stay top drawer. Here are a few ideas:   Ask yourself questions as you read. Look away from the page and summarize out loud what you read.  Use as few words as possible and brief examples to tell what you mean to say. Abbreviate the spellings of what you write in your notes. Note page numbers, titles and authors of books in case you need to refer to them again for a bibliography or another reason.   Create a quiz as part of your note making, as you read and use it later for checkup and a review.  During your break, make your time online count. Get right on Facebook. Turn your phone on and check for texts or missed calls. Don't spend time answering them right then unless there is an emergency. Take part in all your favourite break activities – but only do so for a few minutes. Get it out of your system, and then get back to studying. You'll feel a little better having been "plugged in" and "connected," even if was just for a few minutes.   This little recharging session will do wonders for your focusing ability. You may think it could be distracting and get you off course, but ultimately you'll be able to get more done.As long as you use your break wisely, that is.  The fact of the matter is that we all have high-energy periods of the day and super low-energy bouts, too. When are yours? If possible, study during your high-energy time. You'll be able to focus better and retain the knowledge you're inputting into your brain. Any other time will just be an uphill battle.   For some people, this will be bright and early in the morning when they still have plenty of energy for the day. For others, they get their juices running at night, after powering up for a while. Whichever is yours, listen to your body and study during that time.  The benefits of sleep are practically innumerable. Not only are your hormones regulated and information synthesized, but it helps you fire on all pistons the next day, too. In fact, trying to focus while overly tired is physically similar to trying to focus while drunk.If you can't concentrate, this could be why.   Most people need between 7-9 hours of sleep a night. Some a little more, some a little less. How many hours do you like to sleep, when you don't have to set an alarm? Try to get that every night by going to bed a bit earlier than usual, as required.  You are what you eat after all, and if you eat healthy, your mind will be healthy, too. Aim to eat your favourite colourful fruits and veggies, whole grains, lean meats and dairy, nuts (not greasy fries/chips and fattening candy), and good fats, like the ones in dark chocolate and olive oil. A healthy diet will keep you more energized and make it easier to put your mind to the test.Avoid white foods like white bread, potatoes, flour, grease and sugar. They're just "dead" foods and sugary drinks that cause you to crash in class and at study time.  You are your motivation when it comes down to it. If you convince yourself you can focus, you can. Grab your mind by the horns are start thinking positive: you can do this and you will. There's nothing stopping you but you.   Try the "5 More" rule. Tell yourself to do only five more things or five more minutes before quitting. Once you've finished those, do another five. Breaking tasks up into smaller chunks makes things easier for those with shorter concentration spans and it keeps your mind going longer.  While fresh, you can sizzle with the highest powers of concentration at your disposal. Do the most critical and deep background concepts early before moving onto easier (less challenging) but necessary grinding out of details. If you do the easier tasks first, you will be thinking about and stressing about the harder ones the whole time, reducing your productivity and ability to focus.   That being said, avoid bogging yourself down when reading, or getting stuck and defeated on difficult problems or essay questions. Sometimes the least desirable part of an assignment may be too time-consuming and it could drain/kill all your available time. So try to limit your time and self-supervise to move on to easier matters, if absolutely necessary.  Search on YouTube for a BiNaural Beat, and use of headphones or earbuds are required. If BiNaural Beats work for you, this will be like magic!   Listen while studying. For best results you should listen on a low to medium volume during your study period. Prolonged use is not harmful.  When combined with a good timetable, food, rest and anything else that benefits your study, this track may improve your memory.Study is such an important part of life and to learn how to maintain good focus and concentration is a lifelong skill.  After listening for a few hours your ears will take a few minutes to readjust to the normal ambient sounds in the room. It is perfectly normal, if your hearing is a little distorted. Many other strange effects are possible with BiNaural Beat, but for the majority they work.   Headaches are normal for about 10-25 minutes, this is your brain adjusting to the beat. If it does not subside after 30 minutes, better to leave this out of your routine. Music can also be played along with the beat to make the sound more appealing. Together they may aid further in concentration.  

choose the right spot.  have everything you need to study.  have a snack nearby.  write down your study goals.  make sure your cell phone and other electronic devices are turned off.  consider playing background music softly.  make a timetable.  set aside time to worry or think about other things.  switch up how you learn.  reward yourself.  backtrack, if need be.  make studying more active.  make notes on the concepts, characters, plots, or events described.  get on the internet, and then get right back off after your break.  listen to your body.  get enough sleep.  eat healthy.  take control of your thoughts.  do the least pleasant tasks first.  see whether alpha wave sound tones will give you, the listener, improved focus, memory and concentration for study and other activities.  follow all the concentration steps and tips.  check how the environment sounds after the binaural beat. 

 Other people are outside your control, and if you can't get past worrying about your own image, you can't live freely. You can't please everyone, so thinking that you can will leave you alienated and disappointed.   Don't let other people's views become the words you mold yourself around. Once you get to the point where you are saying to yourself and everyone else that you're just trying to be what everyone else wants, you have reached a point where you cannot be free. Detach yourself from "toxic" people in your life. These are the people who try to tie you down through manipulation, negativity, and other forms of control. Better still, learn how to disarm such people by learning non-violent communication techniques and standing your ground through being less reactive and more responsive and assertive; you have the power within you to remain free of such people and to live free from their harmful ways. Good friends will help you find your balance.; , Be free by focusing on what can be done, rather than on what cannot. Shift your attention to what you can do to make things better for yourself and for others. By doing this, you'll find greater freedom to live the life you want to live.   Remind yourself of your successes instead of your failures. If work or school isn't going as well as it might, focus on your family, your relationships, or how awesome you've become at shooting three-pointers. Focus on the positive. Watch your language. Avoid negative statements like "I can't." Language is powerful, both in convincing yourself and in convincing others. By changing these negative phrases to ones focused on what can be done, you will free yourself from inaction and procrastination. Instead, say, "I've got to do this."  , Lies create a tangled web of deceit that keeps you from being free. Learn to recognize the lies you tell yourself and others. Being sincere and truthful allows you to connect better with people you can trust because they can identify with your vulnerability.   Lies are one form of reacting defensively; for many of us, it is natural to feel a need to defend ourselves in a situation of conflict. Lying during a conflict may seem like a good, defensive way of getting someone to leave you alone but it binds you even more tightly to that person because you've made things less clear and have evaded your real needs rather than stood up for yourself. By responding with loving kindness, you regain your freedom in relationships because you learn to acknowledge the pain, hurt and other negative feelings of others without escalating the conflict and still make it clear that you retain your power to make your own decisions and choices.  Many people associate "having enough money" with freedom, but your attitude toward money says much more about freedom than money itself. Treat money as a tool in your life, not the driver of your life. Learn to save, budget and be a conscious consumer.   Look for what you can do to remove yourself from parts of the consuming cycle that you feel burden you. For example, if you're fed up paying high prices for organic food, dig up your lawn and plant a beautiful vegetable and fruit garden instead. Tend to it regularly, knowing that the fruits of your labor are repaid through communion with nature, health through quality food and role modeling sustainable behavior to your children, neighbors and friends.  Start bartering your skills with others who have skills in making things you can't or don't enjoy making, so that a virtuous cycle kicks into place. From this, you will also gain friendships and connections that might just amaze you.   Make use of online resources to connect with like-minded people, share items and services, and to encourage others to get involved in ways of living more freely. One site you might find useful is Sharehood, a collaborative consumption website that helps you to bring together local community and your neighbors for sharing resources and skills.  Exercise can release endorphins that change your mood for the better, and staying in shape will ensure that you're able to do the things you want to do. Don't let your lack of health keep you from being free to do what you want to do. Choose something you enjoy doing, as exercise should be fun in itself rather than being viewed as a means to something else.Release endorphins to free your spirit. Endorphins are your body's own mood lighteners, bio-chemicals produced by your brain in response to pleasant experiences. Endorphins help you to free yourself from unhelpful emotions that can trap you in ongoing cycles of negativity. The ways to help release endorphins do you good, such as exercising, socializing and laughing, all freeing you up to focus on the things that truly matter to you in life.  Your smile changes your frame of mind. Make a point of laughing at something every day. Start with laughing at your own antics or fun thoughts, then expand to watching a funny movie or going to a comedy club or just doing something that will encourage you to laugh. Laughing and smiling boosts your immune system as well as making you feel better by releasing endorphins. Laughing lets your brain know you're happy, and gets you in a great mood, in the right state of mind.  The sun can brighten up your day as well as your mood. Go to open spaces, do some trekking, enjoy nature and spend time around people. Obviously, observe sun safe procedures during the hottest months.  Being with friends brings out your empathy; understanding and being understood can improve your sense of well-being, also helping to release endorphins. In addition, spending time with friends and being social has been shown to increase serotonin levels, also important for improving your inner well-being.  Being open to new experiences is a source of freedom because you're expanding your horizons, discovering new hidden talents and keeping yourself open to the goodness of life.   See new experiences as opportunities rather than as burdens or something to be worried about. Most of the battle is inside your head, before you've given the new activity a go. Congratulate yourself every time you try something new. And tell others what you've done, to reinforce its good. Your story may help others to live more freely too  , Movies all have soundtracks and so should you. Walking down the street on a horrible rainy day, pick yourself up with something that gets your feet moving and your mind entertained.  Spontaneity is often lost upon entering the adult world of work, parenting and societal obligations. Conforming to what's expected of each adult in society tends to quell the opportunities for breaking free now and then, to do something out-of-character. Restoring a little spontaneity and impulsiveness to your life can bring back some balance.   Check out the fun things that Improv Everywhere has done, like gathering over two hundred people to walk around downtown using the famous "invisible dog" toy and pretending they were real. Doing something that makes people stare is a great way to live free and get out of the box you're trapped in. Look for flash mob videos online to find actions that have brought laughter and enjoyment to people's lives.  Go outside and start walking. Just keep walking in no particular direction and don't stop until you have to. There's something great about taking a walk with no direction or goal in mind.  It's okay to act on impulse without thinking it through sometimes. Have pie for breakfast or shave your head without warning if you want to. Embrace surprises and spontaneity. Shaking up the regular way of things can help you to become more enthusiastic about each day. Who knows what will happen!  , You don't have to be good at whatever it is that fills you with passion, you just have to love it. Maybe it's writing, maybe it's drawing, maybe it's playing sports of some kind. Whatever it is, embrace it with all your heart and allow yourself to get completely involved with it. Tell your family about it, convince your friends to try it, go crazy and let your life revolve around that something you love.  

give less value to what other people think of you.  stop focusing on the bad.  be honest.  come to terms with money (and any lack of it).  make things that you're good at making.  exercise.  laugh and smile whenever possible.  spend time in the sun.  spend time with friends.  do something new as often as possible.  pretend you've got background music in everyday life.  do something outrageous or spontaneous.  take walks.  indulge the occasional impulse.  regularly do something you're truly passionate about. 

 Often, redness and irritation is the result of over-exfoliating or using abrasive or harsh acne reducing products. Stop using anything new you have put on your skin for at least 4 days, and consider switching to a gentler cleaning product.Acne medicines using retinoids are particularly irritating. After 4 days, try using the product sparingly to see if irritation still occurs. If so, throw it away. Do not introduce more than one product at a time to your skin, so you know which one is “too much.”  , A good cleanser should wash off all dirt and makeup, but not your skin’s natural oils. If your skin feels tight or squeaky after washing, the product is too harsh.Cetaphil and Eucerin are good products for sensitive skin.   Hot or cold water can damage capillaries and cause redness. Hot water also dries your skin out quickly, causing redness.Look for a cleanser made for your skin type, whether it tends to be oily or dry. Foaming cleansers are generally bad for dry skin.Avoid cleansers with harsh ingredients like sodium laureth sulfate, menthol or alcohol.Avoid products with fragrances and dyes. Also avoid medicated acne cleansers, since they usually strip away good oils.You may need to use different products for different seasons, depending on how dry the air is and how you skin conditions adjust accordingly.  Choose a moisturizer with glycerin as the first ingredient since it is very efficient at holding in moisture,or just use plain petroleum jelly.Use it every time you shower, after drying off.   Beware of typical hand sanitizers, which contain alcohol and dry out your skin. Look for one specifically made for hydrating dry skin too., If you are experiencing widespread irritation, it may be how you wash your clothes. Try a different detergent made for sensitive skin or that has mostly natural ingredients., If the air is dry, particularly in winter months, using a humidifier can help prevent your skin from drying out while you sleep.Moisture in the air also helps to reduce inflammation.  Fill your plate with anti-inflammatory foods, such as leafy greens, salmon, avocado, and walnuts. Take anti-inflammatory supplements, such as probiotics, spirulina, vitamin C, and fish oil. These nutrients will help you reduce inflammation in your skin.  

stop using harsh skin care products.  wash daily with a gentle cleanser and lukewarm water.  moisturize your skin at least once a day.  switch to a laundry detergent without fragrances or harsh chemicals.  buy a humidifier for your bedroom.  eat an anti-inflammatory diet. 

 Hold a clean, sharp chef’s knife in your dominant hand and hold the ginger firmly against a cutting board. Take care not to let the ginger slip or slide while you are cutting.  Ginger is a very fibrous root; the fibers run along the length of the root and its lobes. Cut across the fibers so that the knife is perpendicular to them while you are cutting.  As you cut the ginger across the fibers, you will be cutting little round shapes, aptly named “coins”. You can use these coins as they are (which are great for making candied ginger) or you can continue slicing., Stack two or three of the coins that you just cut and begin cutting them into slivers. These slivers can be as thick or thin as you desire. If you intend to chop or mince the ginger, you should make these slivers fairly slim.  Line up several of the ginger matchsticks. Cut the sticks crosswise. In other words, you will be cutting them perpendicular to the length of the ginger.  

prepare to cut the ginger.  cut across the fibers of the ginger.  cut the ginger into coins.  julienne the ginger.  mince the ginger. 

 This disease is associated with dryness, cracking, or scaling of the lips.This may also affect the skin around the lips. This may be caused by allergies or by excessive licking of the lips.   To prevent or eczematous cheilitis or lip dermatitis, your doctor may prescribe a topical ointment. Your doctor may also suggest an allergy test to seek out potential irritants.  Cold sores generally appear on the outside of the lips in a cluster of blisters. Canker sores are gray and white surrounded by a red inflamed area, generally located inside the mouth on the inside of lips, cheeks, tongue, or throat.These may be caused by a simple viral infection. Unfortunately, there is no known cure for sores although there are pain relieving options in topical ointments and treatments that may shorten the duration of a cold sore. You may treat these sores with a cool compress. You can also take an anti-inflammatory to help the swelling. You can prevent cold sores by avoiding the saliva (drinking after, eating after, or kissing) of a person who has a cold sore. If the sore is caused by a viral infection, it can be transmitted.  This disease is characterized by white patches on your lips, tongue, cheeks, or mouth.It is most commonly associated with tobacco (smoking or chewing). The best way to prevent this disorder is to stop smoking or chewing tobacco products.   Leukoplakia is usually benign, but can sometimes show early signs of cancer.  This viral disease is characterized by blisters, ulcers, or sores in the mouth.It is a common childhood infection that can treated with plenty of fluids, rest, and over-the-counter pain relievers.   Herpangina is typically short-lived and resolves on its own. Herpangina is similar to hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD). Both are caused by a virus in the same family. HFMD causes the same mouth ulcers as herpangina in addition to spots on the hands and feet. As this is a viral infection, prevent this disease by frequently washing your hands or your child’s hands.  

prevent eczematous cheilitis or lip dermatitis.  identify cold or canker sores.  prevent leukoplakia.  identify the symptoms of herpangina. 

 The formula is Sn=n(a1+an2){\displaystyle S_{n}=n({\frac {a_{1}+a_{n}}{2}})}, where n{\displaystyle n} equals the number of terms in the series, a1{\displaystyle a_{1}} is the first number in the series, an{\displaystyle a_{n}} is the last number in the series, and Sn{\displaystyle S_{n}} equals the sum of n{\displaystyle n} numbers., This means substituting the first term in the series for a1{\displaystyle a_{1}}, and the last term in the series for an{\displaystyle a_{n}}. When adding consecutive numbers 1 through 100, a1=1{\displaystyle a_{1}=1} and an=100{\displaystyle a_{n}=100}.  Thus, your formula will look like this: S100=n(1+1002){\displaystyle S_{100}=n({\frac {1+100}{2}})}.  Since 100+1=101{\displaystyle 100+1=101}, you will divide 101 by 2: 1012=50.5{\displaystyle {\frac {101}{2}}=50.5}.  This will give you the sum the consecutive number in the series. In this instance, since you are adding consecutive numbers to 100, n=100{\displaystyle n=100}. So, you would calculate 100(50.5)=5050{\displaystyle 100(50.5)=5050}. Thus, the sum of the consecutive numbers between 1 and 100 is 5,050.  To quickly multiply a number by 100, move the decimal point two places to the right. 

write the formula for finding the sum of an arithmetic series.  plug the values into the formula.  add the values in the numerator of the fraction, then divide by 2.  multiply by n{\displaystyle n}. 

 Let's face it — sometimes, cheeks just refuse to be cooperative. If you can't get pinker cheeks with the tricks above, try using a little blush to give your cheeks a boost! Start light by adding just a little blush. Remember, you can easily add more, but it can be a pain to remove your blush and start over if you add too much.   There's no single "right" type of makeup to use — what looks good on one person may not look good on another. However, if you're a makeup beginner, it's generally a good idea to start with a mild pink blush, which can contain hints of gold or peach if you like. These shades are a good general choice because they complement nearly all skin tones. See our blush article for tips on applying your makeup.; , The more blush you add, the more noticeable your "rosy cheek" effect will be. If you'd like to bring out your cheeks a little more after applying your first light dusting,feel free to do so, but be wary of applying too much.   As a general rule, people with very light skin should be careful about the amount of blush they apply. Because a pale complexion makes makeup more noticeable, it can be easy to use too much blush (though there are plenty of exceptions to this rule.)  , Applying lots of blush will certainly give you rosy cheeks, but if you don't balance your blush with the rest of your makeup and your outfit, it can easily distract from your natural beauty. Overly-heavy applications of blush can give an artificial, doll-like appearance, especially to people with very light skin.  

apply light blush for a subtle glow.  apply medium blush to define your cheeks.  apply heavy blush for a bold effect. 

 If you are apologizing, it is because you or your company may have done something wrong, failed to communicate properly, or simply be involved in a misunderstanding. Whatever the case may be, the first step is recognizing and stating there is a problem. Be clear and specific when talking about what went wrong. This lets the recipient (your boss, customers, coworker) know that you see the problem, and understand it., It seems simple enough, but your apology will go a long way if you actually say that you are sorry for what happened.Use “I” statements to get the apology across. “I’m sorry,” or “I deeply regret what I did.” This puts the focus on you, and what you did. Otherwise, it might sound as if you are blaming the other person. Make sure to avoid the non-apology, or apologizing for how someone else feels. Avoid statements like “I’m sorry if what I did upset you” or “I’m sorry you took that the wrong way.” When you do that, you aren’t actually apologizing for your actions, just the result, which suggests you didn’t so anything wrong., Try to help the recipient understand how the mistake happened. Even if it was just an oversight or error on your part, identifying the cause of your mistake is a way to tell the other person that you know what happened and can avoid doing it again in the future.   One important part of this is to make sure the apology and explanation are separate from one another. While you want to make sure the recipient understands your intentions, the important thing is that you apologize first. Once that has been accepted, then you can move on to explaining yourself., If you are apologizing, then something has gone wrong. While your apology is a nice start, in order to maintain a good professional relationship it is important that you work with the recipient on finding a solution to the issue. The way you go about doing this depends on the nature of your mistake.   If you are a company apologizing to your customers, explain how you intend to resolve the problem. Make sure you include specifics related to the original problem. Avoid generic statements like “we are doing everything possible to prevent problems like this in the future” will come off as insincere without details.When dealing with customers, resolving the problem can mean giving the customer a discount on their next order if the mistake was a pricing error, or shipping the next order for free if it was a shipping or delivery mistake, or paying for damages that occurred as a result of mishandling. It is important to provide options like this as a way to keep customers. If you are apologizing person-to-person, such as to a co-worker, you may consider asking for discussion and input on the way to resolve the issue. The recipient may not want to discuss it further, but you should give them the option. Offer by saying, “I am open to discussing what happened so we can work on avoiding this again in the future,” or something similar., Depending on the setting, an apology may be seen as an admission of guilt, especially if you are apologizing on behalf of your company to customers. If you or your company is not at fault for what happened, you do not need to issue an apology.Don’t take responsibility for things that are not your fault, and you will avoid over-apologizing, which can weaken your image with co-workers or customers. It is certainly appropriate to express empathy, but you should avoid taking responsibility. You can tell people “I’m disappointed to hear that,” and offer to help resolve the problem, but avoid saying “I’m sorry.” If you are apologizing on behalf of a business to your customers, this may be seen as an admission of responsibility, and you may be held legally and financially liable. Make sure you discuss what happened with a lawyer to discuss any potential legal difficulties before apologizing. This isn’t effective for lots of the smaller mistakes that may happen with customers daily, so you may consider creating company policies for certain mistakes, and how your employees should handle them.  If your customers are angry or upset with something your business has done, you need to move quickly. They are more likely to listen to an explanation if you issue it as soon as possible. The longer you delay saying anything, the more angry the future recipient will be.While there are times when you should delay apologizing in order to consult with other people, such as a lawyer, it is important that you get on that as quickly as possible so you can get your message out as soon as you can.  Depending on the nature of your error, including what you did and who it was against, there are different mediums you can use to respond. If your mistake was one that affected all of your clients, an email is a good choice. If your error was posting an offensive or inappropriate message through social media, using that platform as a place to express your contrition. If you need to apologize to someone in your own company, or to a specific client, try to arrange for a face-to-face meeting. If you can’t be in the same place, try video-conferencing, then a phone call. The closer you are able to get to the person you are apologizing to, the better. This will make you look more serious when offering your apology., Once you have apologized, and the apology has been accepted, you both need to be prepared to move past it. Hanging on to the issue will only make the situation more difficult to handle.This goes for recipients too. If someone apologizes to you, and you accept it, there is no need to dwell on the mistake any longer. Bringing it up again will look petty or unprofessional.  

acknowledge the problem.  make sure you say “i’m sorry.” acknowledging that you were responsible is the most important part of the apology.  offer an explanation.  offer to fix the problem.  make sure it is appropriate.  act quickly.  find the appropriate medium for your apology.  move on after apologizing. 

 Specially formulated cloth shoe cleaners, like Lincoln E-Z cleaner, are designed to remove dirtiness from your shoes without damaging them. Purchase products like these at your local shoe store or in the shoe section of a general retailer.   The directions for your shoe cleaning product may vary depending on its brand. Always follow the label directions for best results. In most cases, specialty cleaners are applied in the same way as soapy water: completely wet the shoe, apply soap to it in sections, brush stains lightly, and rinse the hemp thoroughly when the entire shoe is clean., To improve the stain fighting power of your washing machine, pre-treat stains with a mild soap and water or a suitable specially formulated cloth shoe cleaner. Use a dampened cloth to gently blot cleaner onto stains until they are saturated., To protect your shoes from damage, you may want to put them in a laundry bag before machine washing. Set the machine to a gentle, cold cycle for dyed hemp. Add a cup (237 ml) of white vinegar to the rinse cycle to freshen the shoes and neutralize any remaining soap.   Non-dyed hemp may be machine washed on a warm cycle. However, as hemp is somewhat sensitive to heat, you should only do this occasionally or for severe dirtiness. Machine washing can be harsh on hemp shoes. Shoes that are delicate may be damaged by this cleaning technique. Preserve your shoes by only machine washing them infrequently. 

use a suitable cloth shoe cleaner for severe dirtiness.  pre-treat severe stains before machine washing shoes.  wash shoes in your washing machine. 

 Hellevators are 3-block wide tunnels that prevent spreading of Corruption/Crimson. Why is this crucial? Every biome has something unique about it, and has unique drops, and this will get you far.; , This includes Molten Armor (25 defense for a full set), Night's Edge (42 melee damage), a Molten Pickaxe (can mine Cobalt/Palladium, trust me, you will not regret crafting one), Sharanga (35 ranged damage, turns all arrows in to Spectral Arrows), Flamarang, Sunfury, and a Phoenix Blaster.  This makes your fight with the Wall of Flesh a lot easier.  To summon the Wall, throw a Guide Voodoo Doll in to a lava pool. If you are playing on mobile version of Terraria, just tap on the doll and it will summon it.  The Hungry are little, mouth shaped creatures at the front off the wall. Use your Night's Edge or your Sunfury to fend them off. (Note: They will detach from the boss when they are down to 1/3 health.)  , This is when you should use your Phoenix Blaster, Flamarang, and your Sharanga. Your Sunfury also helps for this part too. Make sure to go for either the eyes or the mouth, because those are the only parts of it that take damage.   This may include, but not limited to, Pwnhammer, Breaker Blade, Clockwork Assault Rifle, Summoner Emblem, Sorcerer Emblem, Ranger Emblem, and Warrior Emblem. Make sure to have a pickaxe on you, because the loot is in a room with demonite bricks. Don't worry about where to find the room; it will be very close by.  The Hallow is the Corruption/Crimson counterpart, where everything is happy and fun. It is normally on the other side of the world of where the the Corruption/Crimson is.

 You might actually be better off starting a business on your own. If you need help, then you could hire someone to work for you part-time or as an independent contractor.Partnerships don’t always go along smoothly, and you shouldn’t jump into a partnership unless you are prepared to work closely with another person.   It makes sense to form a partnership when the success of the venture depends on having the other person’s participation. For example, the partner may bring needed skills, capital, or network connections to the partnership that are essential for the partnership’s success.; , If you don’t know the other partner well, you should try to find out as much about them as possible. You want to figure out how well you will be able to work together. Ideally, you and any partners will have complementary skills.For example, you might be good at finances and legal issues, while the other partner excels at product development and marketing.   You can also consider taking a weekend retreat together. The purpose of the retreat is to allow you and your prospective partner to discuss the expectations you each have.Be sure to discuss what you expect in a partner as well as where you see the business going.  You might be forming a partnership with someone you have worked with before. In that situation, you probably have a good idea of your partner’s communication style.   However, if you haven’t worked together before, then see if you can work on a project with each other before forming the partnership.It doesn’t have to be anything large. But you could work as independent contractors for another company on the project. At the end, you will have a better sense of whether you two are effective team members.  Forming a partnership raises a host of legal issues. A qualified attorney can help you solve problems and provide advice. The attorney can also help you draft the partnership agreement or at least look over the agreement if you draft it yourself.   To find a qualified attorney, you can visit your state’s bar association. These organizations often have referral services which you can use. You might also want to meet with an accountant.An accountant can advise you on tax issues. To find a competent accountant, you can ask your lawyer for recommendations.  There are generally three types of partnerships, each with their own risks. You should discuss with your partner and your attorney which partnership form is best for you.   General partnerships. Partners share equally in profits, management, and liabilities. If you want to deviate from this default, then you need to assign different percentages in the partnership agreement.Limited liability partnerships (LLPs). Under this arrangement, partners are personally shielded from the partnership’s liability. Partners may also have limited input in partnership decisions or be short-term investors in the partnership.Joint ventures. A short-term partnership, e.g., two people working on a single project or for a limited amount of time.  You should begin the Partnership Agreement by opening a blank word processing document and then labeling the document “Partnership Agreement” at the top of the page. You then want to identify the essential components of the partnership: the partners, the type of partnership you are forming, and the partnership’s name and location.   Identifying the partnership includes naming all of the partners and their places of residence. Then state that the partners agree to the substance of the partnership agreement: “The Partners agree as follows:”Also explain what type of business the partnership will be engaged in.For example, “The partners voluntarily associate themselves as partners to perform the general business of and any other type of business from time to time as agreed to by the Partners.” Be sure to include a statement naming the partnership and its principal place of business., In a general partnership, it is assumed that each partner will contribute an equal amount of start-up capital to the partnership. However, if partners contribute an unequal amount, then you should identify the amount contributed by each as well as the type of capital contributed (whether cash or property).   Include language like the following: “Each partner shall contribute to the Partnership an initial contribution of capital.” Then list each partner and specify how he or she will make the contribution. For example: “Margaret Wesson: Capital contribution shall consist of cash in the amount of $25,000.”  , Any property the partners contribute to the partnership becomes the property of the partnership. Also, any property purchased by the partnership belongs to the partnership as well. You should identify any exceptions in your partnership agreement, in case partners want to retain title to their property.   For example, you would state: “It is agreed that the 2014 Toyota Camry is being made available to the partnership by Ethan Smith solely for the use of the partnership and that it is to remain the property of the lender. It shall be returned on January 1, 2018 or when the partnership is dissolved, if prior to that date.”, You can divide profit and losses however you want. For example, you might divide them equally. Or you could divide them in proportion to each partner’s capital contribution. Because this is a key element of the partnership, you should come to an agreement with the other partners before drafting this section of the partnership agreement.You should list the partners along with their ownership percentage. Then you can explain that profits will be distributed based on this percentage: “Generally, gross cash distribution will be made in proportion to Partners’ percentages of partnership interest. Operating expenses will also be shared generally at the time those expenses are realized in proportion to Partners’ percentages of partnership interest.”Also be sure to explain how profits will be distributed. You might distribute only once a year or you could allow partners to make periodic withdrawals. If you allow periodic draws, then be sure to specify how much each partner may withdraw at one time. For example: “Unless and until modified by the unanimous written consent of the partners, will be entitled to a monthly draw of $_____.”  , This is another key part of the agreement. During the normal course of business, countless decisions will have to be made. For example, you may end up buying office supplies for the partnership or purchasing online advertisements. The partnership agreement should identify the people who can make these decisions.   Also be sure to clarify who in the partnership has the power to bind the partnership in a contract. Generally, any partner can bind the entire partnership.However, you can change this default rule. For example, you may only want to authorize one partner to enter into contracts. Alternately, you could give all partners the ability to form contracts provided the contract is not worth more than a certain amount. For any contract in excess of this amount, then you can specify that the partner needs the express written consent of all other partners., Partners end up leaving partnerships for a variety of reasons. For example, they may want to retire. Alternately, they might want to withdraw from the partnership in order to form a different partnership with someone else. Sometimes, partners also need to be expelled. Your agreement should explain the mechanisms for each.   You can provide for retirement or withdrawal by explaining what steps the partner must take, e.g., providing written notice by registered or certified mail to all of the other partners. Also stipulate how much advance notice the other partners must receive.Explain the grounds for expelling a partner. The most common include the failure to make a required capital contribution, failure to fulfill an obligation under the agreement, mental disability, and legal insanity or incompetency.Also explain the process for how the partnership can expel the member. For example, you could decide that the partners will take a vote. Explain whether the vote needs to be majority, unanimous, or some other percentage. Also explain how much notice the expelled partner will be given., You must define under what situations the partnership can be dissolved. Generally, partnerships dissolve automatically on the death of one of the partners, but you can provide for the continued life of the partnership. Explain what triggers dissolution and what steps the partners need to take to keep the partnership going.   For example, many partnerships dissolve when a partner withdraws, retires, or is expelled; a partner dies or enters bankruptcy; a partner becomes incapacitated; or all partners unanimously agree to dissolve.Explain what then happens when dissolution is triggered: “On dissolution, the remaining partners shall have the right to elect to continue business under the partnership name, by themselves, or with any new persons that they choose.”By including this language, you give yourself the option of continuing with the partnership as is. Be sure to state whether the vote must be unanimous, by majority, or by some other percentage.  All partnership agreements should have a “merger” clause. This clause explains that the document contains the entirety of the partners’ agreement. This clause helps pre-empt a partner from later claiming that there were oral agreements between the partners that were not included in the agreement but which should be enforced.   A typical merger clause looks like this: “This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties hereto and may not be modified or amended except by a writing signed by the parties.”, All of the partners must sign their names and write the date.You should also have the partnership agreement notarized.  You need to register a DBA (“Doing Business As”) name with your state if it differs from the partnership’s legal name. For a partnership, the legal name is either the name listed in the partnership agreement or the last names of the partners.For example, if the partnership is named Wesson & Peters, but you want to do business as “The Tax Guys,” then you need to register that name. Contact your county clerk’s office and ask if you need to register the DBA at either the state or county level (or both)., If you form a limited liability partnership, then you will probably need to file a “registration” or “certificate” with the Secretary of State’s office.By contrast, if you have a general partnership, then you might not have to file anything. Check with your lawyer.  Before you can legally run a business, you need to have the proper licenses and permits from your state or municipality. To find out what licenses or permits you need, you can use the Small Business Association’s Licensing and Permits tool at https://www.sba.gov/content/what-state-licenses-and-permits-does-your-business-need. Click on your state to find out what you need.  You need to set up the partnership’s bank accounts. In order to do so, you will need to take the following documents to the bank:The partnership’s Employer Identification Number (also called a “EIN” or “TIN”). You can get this number for free by contacting the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) at (800) 829-4933 or by visiting https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Apply-for-an-Employer-Identification-Number-(EIN)-Online. A copy of your partnership agreement. Your business certificate from the state, which shows the partnership’s name as well as the names of the individual partners.  Unless you are running a partnership from your home, you will need an office. You should think about the following when negotiating a commercial lease:Try not to overcommit on the lease. You want to leave some flexibility. Specifically, you should avoid getting locked into a long lease; instead, a one or two year lease would be ideal. Pay attention to extras not included in the rent. The landlord might charge you for utilities, maintenance fees, and upkeep for common areas. Ask about all “hidden fees” before signing a lease. Ask whether the lease allows subleasing. Also check if there is an exclusivity clause that prevents the landlord from leasing to one of your competitors on the same premises. Both of these could be beneficial to you. Figure out what happens in the event of default. Although it’s painful to consider, your business might not be successful. In that case, you may need to dissolve the partnership. Find out if you are obligated to continue to pay on the lease, or whether you can end the lease early by paying only one more month’s rent.

 The only way for this to work, is if you have this DLC.   You can also adopt children/pets, and marry with the same DLC.; , Solitude is the best if you want a big house.  Besides mods, this is the only way to obtain a house.  For example, Solitude's Jarl's quests are:   The Man Who Cried Wolf, where you must interrupt the necromancer's ritual of summoning Potema Septim. Elisif's Tribute, where you must venture to a specific Shrine Of Talos, and place an item called 'Torygg's War Horn'.  You then become a Thane of the hold, the Jarl allowing you to buy property.

 Before you can sing or write songs successfully, you must learn how to read music. That will allow you to understand the pitch, speed, and rhythm of a song, so you can see how other songwriters have put their songs together and eventually craft songs of your own.If you’re already a student, see if your school offers a music theory class that can help you pick up all of the basics, including how to read specific notes and decipher the beat. If you’re not in school, your local community college or continuing education program may offer an introductory music course. There are a variety of online programs that can help you learn to read music. Many are free, but you can also pay for courses that provide more personal instruction. Some singer songwriters receive a more formal education by attending an arts college or performing arts conservatory with dedicated music programs, such as The Juilliard School or the Berklee College of Music. It isn’t necessary, but a formal degree may open other career paths to you if songwriting doesn’t work out, such as teaching music.; , Most songwriters play an instrument, which they use to help them develop melodies and chords when they’re writing songs. In most cases, they use either an acoustic guitar or a piano, but you can technically use any instrument to help you write a song. Choose an instrument that you have an interest in, so you’ll be motivated to put the work in to master it.If you have the opportunity to learn an instrument as part of your school’s band or orchestra program, go for it. It’s a chance to get hands on instruction without having to pay for it. You can take private lessons to learn how to play the guitar, piano, or another instrument. Visit your local music store to ask about learning -- the store may offer classes or have a bulletin board where teachers can provide their contact details. It’s possible to learn an instrument without a teacher. There are online programs and videos that can provide effective instruction if you’re willing to make an effort.  If you plan to sing your own songs, you want to ensure that your voice is as strong as possible. While practice can help you get better, working with a vocal teacher or coach can provide valuable feedback that improves your singing. A teacher can help correct pitch problems, vocal fatigue issues during performances or rehearsals, poor breath control, and even a lack of confidence.Private vocal lessons can be fairly expensive, so it’s important to set a budget and shop around until you find a teacher who you can afford. If you want to be sure to find a qualified vocal teacher, visit the National Association of Teachers of Singing website. They provide a search engine that allows you to find vocal teachers in your area who meet the association’s standards. If you’re on a budget, your local music store is an ideal place to look for a vocal teacher. You may find graduate students and instructors who only teach part-time, so they don’t charge as much as full-time teachers.  When you’re trying to become a singer songwriter, your goal is eventually performing in front of large audiences. Before you start pursuing the career, it’s important to know that you’re comfortable singing and performing in front of a crowd. If you're a student, you might join your school chorus or glee club. You can also participate in your church’s choir or find another singing group in your area that you can join. Look for any opportunity to gain experience singing in front of others.If you don’t have any opportunities to join a singing group, find ways to perform on your own. Sign up for a local talent show or gather some friends and family that you can perform for. Even participating in karaoke night at your favorite restaurant or bar can help you become more comfortable in front of a crowd.  Before you start to write your songs, it helps to listen other songwriters’ work so you can get a feel for what makes a successful song. Don’t just listen to songs in the genre that you enjoy, though. You can learn something from every type of song, so analyze pop, rock, country, rap, folk, dance, and other types of music and see what you like about each song.Pay close attention to the lyrics of the songs that you listen to. See which ones move you emotionally, so you can try to figure out how to create a similar effect with your own music.  When you listen to music, pay attention to the composition of the songs. Composition refers to how the songs are put together. Most songs typically feature two to three verses and two to three choruses. The verses tell the story or set the scene for your song, while the chorus is a simple, repetitive section that usually draws the listener in. As you listen to a song, try to break it down into these components.Some songs contain a bridge in addition to the verses and chorus. A bridge is usually a section that helps take the song in a new direction. In many cases, it’s instrumental and may feature changes in key, tempo, chords, or instrumentation. The common layout for a song with a bridge is: verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus.In some cases, a song may contain a pre-chorus, which serves a transition between the verses and the chorus. Some songs features intros and outros, which help establish and expand the song’s main theme. It can be comprised solely of instrumentals or feature a combination of vocals and instruments. It may help to print out the lyrics or purchase the sheet music for some songs. That way, you can diagram the songs and label each section as what it is.  The best songs are ones that are rooted in personal observations and emotions. You’ll find inspiration for your songs in the things that you see around you and the experiences in your life, so it helps to write down your thoughts and feelings in a journal. Your entries don’t have to be fully formed lyrics -- just get your feelings down and you can develop them into catchy lyrics later.Carry your journal with you all the time. You never know when an idea for a song or specific lyric will hit you. Sometimes, it’s easier to sing an idea that comes to you. Use a recording app on your phone to hum a chorus or melody line that you come up with suddenly.  There is no right way to compose a song. Some songwriters start with the lyrics and then put a melody or chords to the words. Others start with a melody or chord progression and then add the lyrics later. See which approach feels most natural for you, and go to work writing your song.If you have a specific story or idea that you want to convey in your song, it may be best to start with the lyrics. If you want to capture a certain mood, starting with the melody or chords may be a better approach. When you’re trying to figure out a chord progression for your song, just play chords that you think sound good together. In music theory, there are certain chords that are commonly played together, but you’ll never know if a progression will work until you play it. When you’re having trouble coming up with lyrics, it’s okay to hum nonsense words or syllables until you establish a basic melody for the song.  Once you’ve finished writing the song and you’ve practiced it, it’s time to make a recorded version of it. By recording it, you’ll be able to listen back to it to see if there’s any room for improvement, but you’ll also have a version that you can post online for exposure, or send to record companies as a demo.If you have the money to book a session at a professional recording studio, that is definitely the best option. Do an online search for studios in your area. If you don’t have the budget for a professional recording session or don’t have any studio nearby, don’t worry. You can make a strong recording with a good quality microphone and the right computer software at home.  Once you write some songs that you’re proud of, it’s important to protect them before you start performing or sharing them with the public. As soon as you’ve produced the final written version of your song, you can register your song with the U.S. Copyright Office to ensure that no one else can claim ownership of it.You’ll also need a recorded version of the song. It doesn’t have to be a professional recording from a studio, though. You can use a rough demo version.  After you’ve written at least one song that you’re happy with, it’s time to start singing it in front of an audience. Look for open mike nights at clubs, bars, and coffee shops in your area where you can test out your new songs, and gain more experience performing your material in front of a crowd.In addition to open mike nights, keep an eye out for talent shows and music festivals in your area that might allow you to perform your songs.  If you want to get more exposure and see how your songwriting compares to other artists’ work, you may want to enter a songwriting contest. Not only may you win money or other prizes that can help fund your singer songwriter career, you may also make contacts in the music industry that can help you advance.There are a variety of different contests for songwriting, such as the John Lennon Songwriting Contest and the International Songwriting Competition. Some may be geared toward specific genres, though, so be sure to find one that’s a good fit for your song(s). Do an online search to find songwriting competitions that you may want to enter. In some cases, you may be better off entering local contests because you won’t be competing against as many other songwriters.  Another way to get more visibility as a singer songwriter is to share your music via social media apps, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. YouTube is probably the best tool -- create an account and make videos of yourself singing your original songs. Through the other social media apps, you can share them with friends, family, and potential fans, who will hopefully share them with more people so you can create a larger following.You can also use social media to advertise performances. The more people that you help bring to an open mike night, festival, or other venue, the more of a commodity you’ll seem to booking agents and music industry executives. It’s also a good idea to create a website for yourself and your music. There are a variety of website building sites that make it easy to create a site even if you’re not a computer expert. A fee may be required, though.  When TV shows, commercial companies, and other business need music, they often consult online music catalogs. You can submit your songs to these catalogs so companies can listen to your music and see if it’s a fit for what they need. It’s a good way to break into the industry because it will be cheaper to use an aspiring songwriter’s music than to use a successful, popular musician.Some online catalogs charge a fee to list your songs, so be sure to read the fine print to know what you’re in for.  Some record companies accept unsolicited demos from aspiring singer songwriters, so you can send them recordings of your songs to see if they’re interested. The best way to identify companies that you should contact is to consider the labels that represent sing songwriters with a similar style to yours. Do an online search for the company, and see what their submission policy is.If you’re going to be sending a demo to a record label, you should have a professional recording of your music. Wait until you have the money to buy studio time and produce a high quality demo before contacting a record company.  

learn to read music.  take up an instrument.  work with a singing teacher/coach.  perform in front of a crowd.  listen to a variety of genres.  study song composition.  keep a journal.  decide the best approach for your song.  record your song(s).  copyright your music.  perform at open mike nights.  enter songwriting contests.  post your music to social media.  submit your songs to an online music catalog.  contact music labels. 

 This is a major characteristic of pemphigus vulgaris. This is a chronic disease which is mediated by Immunoglobulin G antibody or IgG. Immunoglobulin G is thought to react in the skin in such a way as to break intercellular junctions of the epidermis and in particular that of keratinocytes. This leads in turn to separation of these cells from each other, a process which is called acantholysis. This in turn leads to the formation of vesicles that contain keratinocytes. There are accompanying to this disease several systemic symptoms such as fever and weight loss. This is a potentially life threatening disorder that can lead to death if left untreated. Treatment of this disorder includes the administration of drugs that suppress the action of the immune system such as steroids. If you suspect this is the disorder you are identifying, try to make sure the person receives medical attention as quickly as possible.; , It differs than pemphigus vulgaris in that it usually affects persons between the ages of 60 and 80. It differs than pemphigus vulgaris also by the lack of oral lesions. It is however, similar to pemphigus vulgaris in that it is mediated by the action of immunoglobulin G also. It is thought to deposit in the skin basement membrane. This causes the basal cells to detach from the dermal layer of the skin. This in turn leads to the formation of subcutaneous vesicles which contain predominantly white blood cells.  This disease is common between the ages of 20 to 40 years. This disorder has strong association with gluten induced enteritis or celiac disease. In spite of the apparent link between the two disorders removal of gluten from the diet does not improve the dermatitis. It is mediated by the action of immunoglobulin A instead of immunoglobulin G. Clinically speaking, this is a chronic disease with relapses and remission. The treatment to this condition is also by suppression of the overactive immune system with steroids.  Skin pathology in this condition can arise as a separate condition or accompanied by other organs in the body. The isolated skin disorder is called discoid lupus erythematosus while that involves other organs is called systemic lupus erythematosus. They differ by the fact that systemic lupus erythematosus has a deposition of immunoglobulin G in the basement membrane of the skin of both diseased and healthy skin, while discoid lupus erythematosus is manifested by deposition of IgG in the affected area only.    Psoriasis. This disorder is as was mentioned idiopathic in which its cause is unknown. The disease is common and affects approximately 1% of the total population. It has a chronic course with remissions and exacerbations. Often the nails of affected persons are involved. The disorder is manifested by the excessive formation of keratinocytes in the basal layer of the skin. This leads in turn to more formation of keratin and its deposition in the epidermis. This disorder is sometimes linked to joint diseases that are similar to rheumatoid arthritis. Lichen planus. This disorder has a chronic course in which women are more affected than men. This disorder is manifested by a decrease in cell proliferation. This leads in turn to more keratin formation with hyperkeratosis. Erythema multiforme. This disorder is a common disease and can affect people with any age. It is associated with many disorders such as cancer and autoimmune diseases.  

look for large blisters on the skin and the oral cavity, especially in people between the ages between 40 and 60 years..  if there are large blisters on the skin but not in the oral cavity, consider the possibility of bullous pemphigoid in older patients.  look for erythematous vesicles in younger subjects.  check for the symptoms of lupus: butterfly-shaped rash (malar rash) on the face that covers the cheeks and bridge of the nose, skin lesions that appear or worsen with sun exposure, mouth sores, and hair loss (alopecia).this disorder can affect many organs in the body including the skin.  learn to recognize the symptoms of idiopathic skin diseases (skin diseases that are idiopathic or their etiology is not known). 

 To bring an action in small claims court, you must be over 18 or an emancipated child. Parties who are mentally incompetent or who do not meet the age requirements must be represented by a court-appointed attorney called a guardian ad litem., The jurisdictional limit is the maximum amount of money for which you can sue in small claims court. You can also ask for other specific types of non-monetary relief. The limit may be different based on what kind of case you have. The following types of cases can be filed in Wisconsin small claims court:   $10,000.00 for debts or other civil actions for claims of money; $5,000.00 in damages for torts and personal injuries; Any eviction action, regardless of how much rent is owed; Return of personal property where the property is worth no more than $10,000.00 and was not the subject of a lease or credit from a dealer; Return of personal property that was the subject of a lease or credit from a dealer where the amount financed was no more than $25,000.00; Return of earnest money (money deposited by the buyer into a trust account while the buyer seeks financing) for the purchase of real property; Actions to enforce an arbitration award for the purchase of real property; and Eviction actions due to foreclosure., Unlike some other states, Wisconsin's small claims paperwork does not instruct you to make a demand to the defendant before you file your case. However, making a written demand shows a good-faith effort to resolve your claim out of court, and may even prompt the defendant to settle.Put your demand in writing, explaining how much the defendant owes you and why.   Describe the transaction or incident giving rise to your claim, what your demand is, and how long you will give the other party to respond before you file your case. For example, "Dear James Smith: On June 1, 2015, I paid you $500 to paint my house at 215 Cliff Street. You did not paint the house, and I am now demanding that you return my $500. Please respond by July 30, 2015, after which date, I will be forced to take legal action." Make sure you have proof of when you sent the demand. If you send it by mail, request a return receipt. If you email you demand, print the email with the date and time showing. Whether the defendant refuses or does not respond, you can show a judge that you tried your best to settle out of court. If you are not sure where the defendant lives, mail the demand to his or her last known address.  Small claims courts use simplified rules of discovery and evidence, and you present your case to the judge, not a jury. Part of what makes regular litigation so expensive and time-consuming is that parties and their attorneys can try to bury each other with discovery requests and depositions and trip each other up with complicated evidence rules. By using limited discovery and evidence rules, small claims court avoids those added costs and complications. You give up the opportunity to use those tactics, but you ensure that they can't be used against you either.   Limited discovery and evidence rules help parties represent themselves effectively without having to hire an attorney. Hiring an attorney is usually not cost-effective when suing for a small amount of money, as the attorney's fees will eat into your recovery. You may still want to hire an attorney for a case you don't think you could win on your own. For example, if you are suing a wealthy corporation with attorneys on staff, or if the facts of your case are particularly complicated, you may fare better with your own attorney, especially if winning is more important to you than the monetary reward.  The Wisconsin court system operates an online forms assistance program, which helps you select the right forms and fill them in correctly. The program asks you questions and generates your forms based on your answers.You can access the Small Claims Forms Assistant at https://myforms.wicourts.gov/.  To file a small claims case, you need to complete the Summons and Complaint, which is made up of two parts. The complaint section is where you enter the details about your case and for how much money you are suing. The summons section informs the defendant that he or she has been sued and must respond. You must have the form notarized when you sign it. You can find the Summons and Complaint, complete with instructions, at https://www.wicourts.gov/formdisplay/SC-500I.pdf?formNumber=SC-500I&formType=Form&formatId=2&language=en.   If you are suing to enforce a prior judgment via a garnishment, use this Summons and Complaint instead: https://www.wicourts.gov/formdisplay/SC-301.pdf?formNumber=SC-301&formType=Form&formatId=2&language=en. If you are suing to recover possession of personal property, use this Summons: https://www.wicourts.gov/formdisplay/SC-516.pdf?formNumber=SC-516&formType=Form&formatId=2&language=en.  Naming the defendant can be complicated. If an individual person or group of people are liable for the harm you suffered, you can easily name those people. But if those people work for a corporation, LLC, or partnership, naming the right defendant, then you want to make sure that you sue the right organization and name it correctly in your complaint. For more detailed information on naming the right defendant, see Appendix B of the instructions at https://www.wicourts.gov/formdisplay/SC-6000_instructions.pdf?formNumber=SC-6000&formType=Instructions&formatId=2&language=en.  You must sue the defendant in a court that has jurisdiction over the claim. Generally, you can sue a defendant in the county where he or she resides, or in a county where the claim arose.For example, suppose that the defendant breached a contract for a business deal in Chippewa County, WI. You live in Dane County, and the defendant lives in California. You can sue the defendant in Chippewa County, or even in California, but not in Dane County.  Make two copies of your Summons and Complaint for each defendant in addition to the original. Take your forms to the court clerk, who will assist you in filing your case. The clerk will stamp your forms as "filed" and return the copies to you. The clerk will give you a hearing date. The date may be a few weeks or a few months away, depending upon how busy your court is.   The filing fee for most small claims case $94.50. (Fees may differ in Milwaukee County.)If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, ask the clerk how to file a petition for a fee waiver. The form for a fee waiver is available at https://www.wicourts.gov/forms/CV-410.PDF.  After you file your paperwork, the defendant must be served with copies, giving him or her notice of the lawsuit. In most cases, the defendant can be served by mail; otherwise, he or she must be personally served, meaning that the server gives the defendant the documents in person. You cannot serve the defendant yourself. You must arrange to have the defendant served by a professional process server, the sheriff's department, or someone else who is over 18 and not involved in the case.In eviction actions, the server usually must also post a copy on the door of the residence. Ask the court clerk what forms of service are permitted in your case under the court's rules.  You must file a form with the court signed by the person who served the defendant. There are several versions of the form, depending upon the type of case and the type of service. Each requires that the server sign the form in the presence of a notary. Once it has been signed, file the affidavit with the court.Use the Affidavit of Mailing if the defendant was served by mail. It is available at https://www.wicourts.gov/formdisplay/SC-5130.pdf?formNumber=SC-5130&formType=Form&formatId=2&language=en. Use the Affidavit of Service (Eviction) for eviction actions. It is available at https://www.wicourts.gov/formdisplay/SC-5100.pdf?formNumber=SC-5100&formType=Form&formatId=2&language=en. Use the Affidavit of Service (Individual/Sole Proprietorship/Partnership) if the defendant is an individual or one of those specified organizations. It is available at https://www.wicourts.gov/formdisplay/SC-5120.pdf?formNumber=SC-5120&formType=Form&formatId=2&language=en. Use the Affidavit of Service (Corporation or LLC) if the defendant is an LLC. It is available at https://www.wicourts.gov/formdisplay/SC-5110.pdf?formNumber=SC-5110&formType=Form&formatId=2&language=en.  Ask friends, family, employers, landlords, and the post office if you cannot find the defendant's new address. You might even hire a private investigator. If you have made every effort to locate the defendant and still have not been able to successfully serve him or her, you may be permitted to serve the defendant by publication. This means that you publish the notice in a local newspaper as a last resort to give notice to the defendant.  Ask your process server for an Affidavit of Due Diligence/Not Found/Attempted Service. Process servers and the sheriff's department regularly give out these affidavits when they are unable to successfully serve the defendant. This form is signed by the server and states that he or she made every necessary effort to serve the defendant, but was unsuccessful., This form is available online at https://www.wicourts.gov/formdisplay/SC-5160.pdf?formNumber=SC-5160&formType=Form&formatId=2&language=en. Enter information about the parties to the lawsuit and the hearing date. You will mail this information to the defendant at his or her last known address, and publish it in the newspaper., The letter should include your name, the defendant's name, the defendant's last known address, the case number, and some language akin to the following: "Enclosed, please find a Publication Notice and Summons and Complaint which I have filed in the ______ County Circuit Court." Keep a copy of the letter for your records., Mail the cover letter, Publication Summons and Notice, and Summons and Complaint to the defendant's last known address. Request a return receipt so that you will have proof of the date upon which the documents were delivered.  Deliver the Publication Summons and Notice to the local newspaper that circulates in the area where you believe the defendant lives and ask the newspaper to publish the notice. The newspaper will charge you a small fee for this service. Although it is unlikely that the defendant will actually see the published notice, courts acknowledge that this method of service as a last resort.   The applicable statute requires only that the notice be published once, not that the notice be repeated for multiple days.Once you have given your Publication Summons and Notice to the newspaper, take all of your forms to the court clerk for filing., In presenting your case, you will have the opportunity to question witnesses and present evidence. Collect any documents and photographs that support your claims and organize them in a binder in such a way that you can quickly refer to them in court. Make copies for the judge and for the defendant. Also arrange for any witnesses to accompany you to court on your hearing date.  An opening statement should quickly and clearly inform the judge what kind of relief you are asking for and why. Briefly describe what the defendant did that harmed you, what evidence you brought to prove that the harm occurred, and what you would like the court to do, i.e. award money damages, evict a tenant, or order the return of your personal property. The judge will ask you to elaborate where necessary in order to fully understand the dispute.   Write out your opening statement ahead of time if it will help you remember the points you want to make. Having a written statement to refer to can help you to feel less nervous in court.  Dress professionally, arrive early, and wait for your case to be called. When your case is called, step forward and take your place at the plaintiff's side of the table. Do not address the defendant directly. You should speak to the judge, even when talking about the defendant. When you present evidence, give a copy to the defendant and a copy to the bailiff, who will deliver it to the judge.  If you win your case, the court will issue a judgment to you, which is a piece of paper that formally states that the defendant owes you money (or that the defendant must move out, for an eviction action). Hopefully, the defendant will voluntarily comply with the order, but collections and evictions are a separate process.   To collect on your judgment, you may need to garnish the defendant's wages, get a lien on his or her real property, or get a writ of execution to take personal property to satisfy the debt.Ask the court clerk what forms you need to proceed with one of those collection tactics. In order to evict a tenant, take your judgment to the sheriff, who will post a notice at the property instructing the defendant to vacate within 10 days. If the defendant fails to leave, the sheriff will return to remove the defendant. 

satisfy the age requirements.  verify that your claim is within the jurisdictional limit.  make a written demand.  understand the procedural limitations.  consider using the small claims forms assistant.  fill out a summons and complaint.  name the party you want to sue.  decide where to sue the defendant.  file your forms with the court clerk.  have the defendant served.  file an affidavit of service.  try to locate the defendant.  get an affidavit of due diligence.  fill out a publication summons and notice.  prepare a cover letter.  mail your documents.  publish the publication summons and notice.  gather witnesses and evidence.  prepare an opening statement.  follow court protocol.  collect on your judgment. 

 As you get used to the fingerings and air intensity, you can shape the sound to create a warmer tone.; , This will be your first altissimo note. Meet C#!  , This is D.  Now, only cover the middle hole on the upper joint, the two bottom holes on the lower joint, and keep the pinky key down. This is high G, exactly one octave above the top of the staff.  Now you will perform an overtone. Try blowing into the clarinet harder and aim for getting a half step higher than G, G#/Ab. This note can also be done by playing G from the previous step and lifting the 3rd finger on the lower joint, so only the 2nd hole on both the upper and lower joint, and the upper left pinky key as normal are being covered.  Now perform an overtone on this for an A. This note can also be played by pressing the 2nd and 3rd holes on the upper joint, like playing the high E, but instead of using the upper left pinky key, use the lower left pinky key, the same one used for 3rd space/middle register C#. This is more of a standard fingering that could be called an overtone, but the C# key makes it much more of a defined A.  Press the key used for the G# on the staff. Finger the rest like the high F you played earlier. Now aim to play the overtone and get A#.  Cover the top two holes on the bottom joint and make sure you haven't forgotten the pinky key for any of the altissimo notes(excluding C#). Now try to make the pitched squeak on this note and if you can get it out, you have accomplished playing a B over an octave from the staff.  This is high C, on top of the 5th ledger line over the staff! This is an accomplishment!  , It is advisable to use the altissimo fingerings you just learned, because then you don't need to try as hard to get the right note, you're in the range already.  The best way to prepare yourself for this is to play the mouthpiece. To do this, take the clarinet mouthpiece and using only changes in your throat play different notes. You should (with practice) be able to play an entire octave on the mouthpiece alone.  

understand that these notes are pitched squeaks and probably won't be the most relaxing sounds to your ears for a while.  finger a top space e. then lift your top finger.  finger a top line f. now, do the same thing for this note, except for intonation reasons put your pinky on the key used in low g#.  follow this pattern until you get to the high f#.  finger the d you learned earlier.  finger the e you learned earlier.  press the register key down without the thumb down.  cover the top two holes on the upper joint with the thumb and register key down.  cover the top hole on the upper and lower joints, keep the thumb and register key down, and keep the pinky key down.  notes above this can be produced using overtones.  remember that playing above a high a is largely a matter of overtones and not so much an exercise in fingering. 

 Talking in private will help you feel less nervous and more comfortable about asking for help.It will also give your teacher more time to help you because they aren’t trying to teach at the same time.   For example, you could say, “When you have time later today, could we talk about a problem I’m having?” If you’re afraid to approach your teacher, put a note on their chair. The note could say, “Can we talk later about something personal? Thanks, Mark.” You could also send your teacher an email or message letting them know you would like to ask their help with a personal issue.  Sometimes teachers will try to offer advice on what you should do, when all you wanted was for them to listen. If you let your teacher know how they can help, it will make it easier for them to give you the help you want and need.Think about what kind of help you want. Ask yourself, “Do I want her to listen, to give me advice, or to do something about the problem?” Tell your teacher how they can help. For example, “Can you help me come up with ways to make more friends?” If you don’t know how you want your teacher to help, you it’s okay for you to say that, too. Try saying, “I need your help with a problem, but I don’t know what kind of help I need.”  , Also, being honest will help your teacher figure out the right way to help you.   The more truthful information your teacher has about what is going on, the more they will be able to help. If you are afraid you will get in trouble, then say that. You could say, “I need your help with something but I’m scared I’ll get in trouble.” If you are asking for help, but also trying not to get someone else in trouble, you could leave out names, but still be honest about what is going on. For example, “My friend is thinking about cheating on a test and I need advice on how to stop them from doing something so stupid.”  

ask to talk to the teacher in private.if you want to ask you teacher for help with a personal issue that you have, you should talk to the teacher alone, not during class time.  tell your teacher what kind of help you need.  be honest.it will be a lot easier for you to ask your teacher for help if you are truthful about what is going on.you won’t have to worry about keeping a lie straight, so you will feel more relaxed talking to your teacher. 

, Use a conventional 20 x 13cm tin or a muffin tin.  Boil 200ml of water in a small pot. Add the dates and let them boil for 5 minutes. Drain the dates and save the sweet liquid in a cup., Add them to a food processor or blender with 100ml of the date liquid. Blend until completely smooth.  Place the nuts, dried fruit, flour, spices and baking powder in a mixing bowl and stir until combined. Add the date and banana puree as well as the rum. Stir until the mixture has the consistency of batter.  Beat them into the batter one at a time until just combined with the loaf batter.  Use the back of the spoon to smooth the top of the batter.  The loaf is ready when a toothpick poked into the center comes out clean, and the top is golden brown.  Cut it into slices and serve with tea.

 In the United States, the most vital precaution you must take in advertising your business in any form is to ensure you’re targeting adults over the age of 21. The images you use cannot appeal to children and you cannot post print content in areas within 1,000 feet (300 m) of a school, playground, child care center, recreational center, public park, library, or game arcade.Your marketing materials cannot contain cartoons characters, toys, or other depictions that would appeal to minors.  Avoid using plays on other registered products or services, regardless of their industry. Pay special attention when naming edible products to avoid copyright infringement and a subsequent lawsuit.For example, a dispensary that sold edibles called Reefer’s Cups was sued by Hershey’s. Major corporations will waste no time in going after small cannabis-related businesses to disassociate themselves from the industry.  The industry exists in many grey areas and its public perception is evolving. You should make an effort to use your brand to advance positive, informative content and avoid negative stereotypes.Maintain fair labor practices, abide by all of your local jurisdiction’s applicable laws, and represent your business with professionalism. Avoid derogatory and sexist messaging. For legal and professional purposes, avoid advocating over consumption of marijuana. 

avoid advertisements that appeal to minors.  steer clear of copyright infringement.  consider how your brand can advance your industry.

 Place each chicken breast between two pieces of plastic wrap. If you have a meat mallet, you can use this to pound out chicken breast. If you do not, you can use a wine bottle, canned food, or a pan or pot.Start pounding the chicken on the thickest part. This is usually found near the center of the chicken. Use gentle strikes as pounding too hard can damage the meat. Move outward, working from the center to the sides. Pound out each chicken breast until they are all 1/4 of an inch thick.; , Add the flour to a small mixing bowl. Then, add a small amount of salt and pepper. Use a wire whisk to mix everything together., Egg wash helps coat the chicken for cooking. To make it, add your eggs to a bowl and beat them into an even mixture. Then, mix in your water. Set the egg wash, as well as the flour, aside for now., Add the olive oil to a large skillet. Heat it over medium-high heat.Olive oil is ready when it has a watery, glistening appearance. You can also toss in a small bit of food, like a piece of garlic or onion. If the food sizzles immediately, your olive oil is ready to use., As the olive oil heats, work on coating the chicken breasts. First, coat them in the flour mixture. Then, dip them in the egg wash, coating them completely in that as well. Allow any excess egg wash to drip off each chicken breast before proceeding with the cooking process., Place each chicken breast in the skillet. Keep the heat at the medium-high setting. Cook the chicken beasts for two minutes on each side, or until each side is golden brown.Do not worry if the chicken breasts are not cooked all the way through. You will be cooking them more later.  Add the lemon rinds to the skillet first. Cook them for one to two minutes. Once the lemon rinds are giving off a strong scent, mix in the wine, broth, and lemon juice.Allow the ingredients to simmer for five minutes. This should reduce the amount of sauce slightly.  Coat your stick of butter in flour. Then, add it to the sauce. Stir everything together until the butter melts and the flour is mixed into the sauce., Turn down the heat to medium-low. Add the chicken breasts to the pan. Place one lemon slice on top of each chicken breast. Simmer until the chicken cooks through, which should take about two minutes. Then, garnish the chicken with parsley before serving.To make sure the chicken is done, insert a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the chicken. It should be at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit (about 71 degrees Celsius).If you don't have a thermometer, poke the meat. Any juices that escape should be clear.  

pound the chicken breast flat.  mix salt and pepper with the flour.  make an egg wash.  heat the olive oil.  coat the chicken breasts.  cook the chickens for two minutes on each side.  cook the lemon, wine, broth, and lemon juice.  add the butter.  finish cooking the chicken. 

 Empathy is one of the most powerful tools you can use to support parents of special needs children. The parents often have feelings of grief and loss of dreams and expectations, and they may feel guilty about these feelings.Stay away from saying "I'm sorry" or making similar comments, but be sure to validate their feelings. It may be essentially automatic for you to apologize, but this isn't what the parents need to hear. You have nothing to apologize for, and you'll better support the parents by accentuating the positive rather than acting like something terrible has happened to them. Ask if there is anything specific that offends or annoys them, so you can refrain from doing those things. For example, some people are deeply offended by "people-first" language, in which you describe their child as a "child with special needs" rather than a "special needs child." They prefer "identity-first" language, instead.Although the word is used in legal and social contexts, many people also dislike the word "disability," because it focuses on what the child can't do rather than what they can. Others prefer it to terms they find patronizing or condescending. The only real way to know is to ask about their personal preference, if they have one.  Parents with special needs children want to protect their child, and may have significant concerns about the future. As someone who cares for them, your role is to acknowledge those concerns and recognize them as valid.Avoid using dismissive language. If the parents mention something about their child, you may be inclined to say something like "oh, that's no big deal." However, for that child it may be a very big deal. Similarly, saying the child will grow out of it or be "better" when they're older will only show that you don't understand that child's diagnosis or how it affects their life. Instead, accept the parents' concerns at face value and acknowledge their validity. You might say "I understand that you're concerned about Jamie making friends in a new school. That's a valid concern. What can I do to help?" You can also say, “What are you thinking about doing about it?” to help them develop solutions.  Parents with disabled children often feel powerless to help their children and may believe they are not providing enough for their children or doing all that they can do. You can support the parents by reminding them of the good things and maintaining a positive outlook on the future.They need people to remind them that they are good parents, so when you see them doing something admirable, say so.   Be there to celebrate with them on the good days, and on the bad days you can be the one to remind them of the good days and reassure them that there are many more good days ahead. At times you may not feel like being positive, but being optimistic (even if you have to fake it) encourages the parents and families to carry on. You do want to keep your optimism in check, though. Don't insist on a positive attitude at the expense of failing to acknowledge the parents' legitimate concerns. Saying things like "Oh, it'll be just fine. There's nothing to worry about!" can make the parents think you're being dismissive.  If you also have experience with disability, the parents may come to you with questions. However, if you don't have experience raising a special needs child you typically aren't going to have any advice that would be helpful.If you've been reading about the child's diagnosis or about parenting disabled children, you may find an article or website that you want to share with the parents. However, you shouldn't do this in a way that comes across like you are judging them, or criticizing their parenting skills. For example, if you read something that you think would benefit the parents, you might say "I read this article yesterday that reminded me of you as a parent. Would you like me to send you the link?" If they are interested, you can share it with them.  

empathize with the parents.  acknowledge the parents' concerns.  stay positive.  avoid giving unsolicited advice. 

 Get to know the characteristics of the border collie. Spend some time looking online at dog breed websites, such as the American Kennel Club (AKC). Many of these sites will provide the history of the collie as well as some useful care tips. You can also talk to any friends who own collies and ask them about their ownership experiences.If you need additional guidance you can talk with a dog breed consultant in your local area or online.; , Border collies are highly intelligent and require a great deal of personal attention. They also need a fair amount of space to run around and play. Look at your daily routine and see if you can envision when you will spend time with your dog and how. Also, think about whether or not you can provide the material conditions (i.e. space) that a collie needs to thrive.Collies enjoying chasing things, including cars, so they can be a real challenge in an urban space. If you live in an area like this you will need to invest in a sturdy fence and a quality leash.  You may or may not have a preference in this area. Or, you may like the idea of breeding your dog in the future. Females in the breed are generally smaller by a few inches and five pounds or so. There are few real behavioral differences., This is an important decision as it will broaden or limit your search options. Purebred dogs are generally automatically eligible (with paperwork) for AKC competitions and sports. However, they can also fall prey to a variety of genetic disorders and health issues. Crossbred or mixed dogs are generally restricted in AKC activities but can still compete in other areas. They can also combine the best (or worst) characteristics of multiple breeds.For example, a mixed breed Golden Retriever and Border Collie puppy could possess the affective characteristics of the Golden and the athletic prowess of the Collie.  A puppy will generally require additional socialization and training in order to become a good mature dog. However, you can establish a very close bond from a young age. An adult dog may already have the potty training aspect down and some other tricks as well perhaps. However, they can also have behavioral baggage from their previous owner experiences.As you make your decision remember that a Border Collie puppy period lasts for around three years.  Border Collies are herding dogs by nature and this means that they can occasionally take this impulse out on small pets and children as well. You will want to carefully consider the comfort of others when choosing a particular Collie. Some dogs do better than others in household situations.No matter which dog you choose you will want to carefully introduce it to any children or other pets. Make a point to monitor all interactions between the Collie and small children in particular. Never leave them alone together., Make sure to budget for the purchase of the dog itself (which can range from free to hundreds of dollars) and the dog’s immediate care as well. This would include veterinary treatment, food, training items, and bedding. Anticipating these costs in advance will make it less of a shock when they pop up.  Not all dogs are the same. You want to look for a Border Collie that possess a mild temperament, basic manners, and an intellectual curiosity. Your dog should be interested in interacting with you or other strangers. It should be curious about new sounds or smells. It should fall somewhere between the leader of the pack and the wallflower., If you’ve never had a Border Collie before or even owned a dog, fostering is a great way to familiarize yourself with the breed and with dog ownership in general. You will be responsible for the day-to-day care of a Collie until a new home is found. This is a great way to see if a Collie would fit your lifestyle.Fostering also allows you to save a dog’s life in the process. Every dog being fostered is one less potential dog in a kill shelter or on the streets.  

research the breed.  consider your lifestyle.  choose male or female.  decide on a pure or mixed breed.  decide if you want a puppy or adult dog.  take your household’s other members into account.  keep the cost in mind.  know how to select a particular collie.  consider fostering. 

 To stay positive and maintain your happiness no matter what, it is important to recognize your value and learn to appreciate yourself. Having self-worth means that you do not base your value on what other people think of you, the job or title you have, or any other external factor. If you have self-worth, then you will see yourself as a valuable person no matter what.Try making a list of all of the things that you value about yourself that have nothing to do with your relationships with other people, jobs, or other external factors. For example, you might include in this list that you are creative, honest, and compassionate. You might also include things like your interests or skills, such as knowing how to play the guitar, being an avid reader, or enjoying fishing. Leave out items that have to do with external factors, such as how much money you make, things other people have praised you for, or items you own.  No matter what, you are a unique person with much to offer the world. Everyone has flaws, but by accentuating the positive aspects of your personality, you can begin to eliminate negative thoughts about yourself.   A good starting point for being at ease with yourself is to not try to please everyone. Many people think that they have to “fake” their way through life because others won’t like them if they don’t seem successful. But playing that kind of role can leave you deeply unhappy. Focus on being the best version of yourself that you can be while surrounding yourself with people who care about your well-being.Surround yourself with people who care about you. Remember that if people try to pressure you into doing something that you don’t want to do, they don’t have your best interests at heart. Developing a close-knit and caring social circle is a great way to be at ease with who you are.  If you rely on short-term events or material goods as sources of pleasure, you may feel depressed over the long term. That is because you’ll get used to each short-term pleasure and your mind will need more and more stimulation over time to stay happy. Inject a sense of variety and spontaneity into your day-to-day life so you can avoid feeling like you’re stuck in a rut.   Try surprising your spouse or partner with a weekend getaway, or expand your skillset so that you can take on new tasks at work., Any time something good happens to you, remember to savor the moment as much as possible. Never take anything positive for granted. Be grateful for little moments of joy in your daily life.Try stopping for 10-15 seconds to think about a happy event. Remember to focus on why the event makes you happy and what kinds of pleasure you derive from it. Making this activity part of your daily routine can help you cultivate a positive attitude, which will have positive effects on your health in the long term., Many people ruminate too much on their mistakes or other bad situations while forgetting good things that they have done or that have happened to them. This is understandable because the human brain is hardwired to look for threats. But excessive negative thinking can be bad for your health.   When you have negative thoughts, try stopping to write them down. Doing so can help you put the thoughts in better perspective. For instance, thinking that you constantly forget to do something may look silly once you’ve committed it to paper. By subjecting negative thoughts to analysis rather than dwelling on them, you’ll find it easier to develop a positive outlook., Helping other people regularly can improve your mood. Whether it’s spending quality time with friends who are going through a rough patch, volunteering at a charity event, or donating money to charity, helping people will also help you feel good about yourself., Don’t take anything for granted. Show gratitude as much as possible, whether to your spouse, partner, parents, children, or friends. Make sure they know how happy you are to know them. If they know you appreciate them, they will appreciate you even more, which can only improve your self-esteem and mood. 

build your self-worth.  be at ease with yourself.  maintain a sense of variety in your life.  appreciate the little things in life.  avoid focusing too much on negative situations.  give as much of your time and money to others as possible.  be grateful for what you have. 

 Dry socket has some common symptoms that may help you to determine if that is the problem. The most common symptoms of dry socket are:   Severe pain, especially radiating from the site of tooth extraction out across that side of your face. The pain is intense and you have to manage it continually. Visibly "empty" appearance at the site of tooth extraction and the entire area will have a grey color compared to the usual purple, red, white, or yellow which indicates good healing. Visible bone in the open wound on your gums. Swollen lymph nodes in the jaw and/or neck. Fever. Foul taste or odor in the mouth.; , While a dry socket may develop in anyone's mouth following a dental surgery, certain risk factors such as tobacco use, estrogen-based oral contraceptives, and use of corticosteroids or very bad oral hygiene and not following the instructions of your dentist may increase the chances of developing a dry socket., If you suspect that you've developed a dry socket following a dental surgery or tooth extraction, contact your dentist or doctor immediately.  Though pain medication will not help the wound heal or prevent infection, it will help you manage the pain associated with a dry socket. Your doctor may recommend a prescription-strength pain medication, or you may wish to stick with over-the-counter medications like aspirin or acetaminophen.Do NOT give aspirin to children or adolescents. Use of aspirin in children or teenagers may cause complications with the liver and brain. Consult with your child's pediatrician for guidance on what medication would work best for your child.Don’t exceed the dosage with ibuprofen either because this can lead to severe stomach or intestinal bleeding.  Use cold packs only for the first 48 hours.   Fill a sandwich bag with ice cubes, or wrap ice cubes in a clean towel. In a pinch, you can also use a bag of frozen vegetables wrapped in a paper towel. Apply to the affected side of the face. Remove the bag if it starts to feel like it is burning your skin or you may damage your skin. Keep the ice pack on for 20 minutes, then off for 20 minutes. After two days you should switch to using a warm compress, as a cold compress will no longer reduce swelling or inflammation after the first 48 hours., Drinking clear liquids, especially water at room temperature, is crucial following any surgical procedure.Avoid alcohol after any surgery. Water at room temperature is the best beverage to stay hydrated. If you like, you may wish to alternate water with a sugar-free sports drink.  This will remove debris and help sooth inflammation.Add approximately half a teaspoon of salt to one cup of lukewarm water. Stir the salt water thoroughly, so that it is mostly dissolved. Very gently swish the salt water around in your mouth, focusing on the affected side of your mouth without creating negative pressure which can dislodge the clot. Repeat after each meal and before bed, and any times in between when you believe a saltwater rinse might be helpful.  The physical act of smoking a cigarette may cause a blood clot to come dislodged, and using chewing tobacco or passing smoke over the socket may further irritate the wound and prolong the pain and inflammation.Try using a nicotine patch if you don't believe you can't quit smoking during the time it takes for your mouth to recover. Talk to your doctor about smoking alternatives.  Some patients have found that using a few drops of clove oil to treat the site of an open dental wound may alleviate some of the pain.This should not be done as an alternative to seeking professional medical advice and assistance. Rather, it is meant to provide temporary pain relief in the event that immediate medical assistance is not available.   Apply one or two drops of clove oil to a clean cotton swab. Dab the swab against your gum where the tooth was extracted. Repeat as necessary to help relieve pain and inflammation.  One common method of treating a dry socket is by flushing the socket. This removes any external debris, such as food or dirt, and may help reduce the chances of infection. This can be done by a dentist or oral surgeon, or at home with the right equipment.Use a clean, plastic syringe with a curved tip. Fill the syringe with clean water or clean salt water, or use a prescription rinse if your doctor has given you one. Or, you can even use an alcohol-free diluted mouthwash. Flush the socket from multiple angles starting on the third day after the extraction. Be sure that any visible debris is completely removed. Continue to flush after every meal and before bed until the wound begins to heal and debris no longer pools in the socket., The oral surgeon or dentist who performed your tooth extraction may pack the wound with medicated dressings. The medication applied to these dressings can help relieve pain and prevent infection. You will most likely have to change the dressings every day, but your oral surgeon will determine the frequency and duration of medicated dressing applications., This has been shown to reduce the incidence of developing a dry socket. Having the wound sutured by your oral surgeon may also prevent dry socket., This should be done immediately before and after surgery for best results.Unscrew the cap and pour mouthwash into the cap. Dilute it with water so that it is 50% water and 50% mouthwash. Gently swish the mouthwash around in your mouth moving your tongue from one cheek to another. You may wish to concentrate your swishing efforts around the affected area. Spit out the mouthwash into the sink. Rinse your mouth out with water immediately afterward if the sting of mouthwash becomes too intense.  This is especially important during the first 24 hours after surgery. Gradually move from soft foods to semi-soft foods as your wound heals, but it's generally best to avoid hard, chewy, crunchy, and spicy foods, as these are most prone to pooling in the socket and causing irritation or infection., If you're recovering from oral surgery, avoid smoking for at least 48 hours after the procedure. If you use chewing tobacco, avoid using it for at least one week after the procedure. Use of tobacco products may increase irritation, prolong the healing process, and leave wounds more susceptible to infection. 

identify the symptoms.  know who is at risk.  see a doctor or dentist.  take pain relievers.  use ice or a cold compress on the side of your face experiencing pain.  stay hydrated.  use a salt water rinse.  avoid using tobacco products.  try clove oil.  flush the socket.  pack with medicated dressings.  have your oral surgeon pack the wound immediately after surgery.  use antibacterial mouthwash.  stick to soft foods.  avoid using tobacco. 

 Trouser-cut pants are a good choice for business or formal settings, such as the office or church. You can wear your trousers with a pleat or cuff if you like that look, as well.; , Skinny jeans are a casual style that is best suited to everyday wear or going out. Look for a pant that follows the shape of your leg as it tapers down to the ankle. You can experiment with distressed or neutral washes to complement your clothes.  Straight-leg pants are a versatile cut that can equally become more formal or casual depending on the garments you pair them with. Look for pants that have a uniform width from the thigh to the ankle.This cut tends to flatter all body types.  A big trend right now is pants that double as leisure and athletic clothes, affectionately known as athleisure. Pick up a pair of maroon legging that you can wear to the gym then to brunch. It’ll be a comfortable, easy addition to your wardrobe.  

select trouser-cut maroon pants for a business look.  try maroon skinny jeans for a casual look.  choose straight-cut maroon pants for a polished look.  don maroon leggings as athleisure wear. 

 One good way is to line a counter with several layers of newspaper and work over an old ice cream container placed on this paper surface.   See Warnings below for ventilation and proper disposal.  Tip into a lidded container ready for proper disposal.   This step may not be applicable, if so, simply skip to the next step.  Swish it about and dispose of the remains in a lidded container that you can dispose of properly. Don't wash it down the drain, as these contents may harm the environment.   If you find there are dried-on blobs of polish that stubbornly resist removal, add nail polish thinner to cover, then soak for about five minutes. Then use a toothpick to pick off the stuck-on polish.  Add the lid on tightly. Shake this around for about a minute, to lift off any remains and pick up the last of the nail polish. This will also clean the brush. Tip into the container, then dispose of the container properly.  Then rinse out with soapy water.  Once dried, it's ready for repurposing.  Allow to fully dry before reusing.   Only use non-toxic cleaners on the brush if the brush is to be reused on your body, although even if it's just for craft use, non-toxic is a good idea. If you don't need the brush but you do need the lid, such as for one of the storage options, simply snap the brush off at the highest point possible and dispose of it.  

work over a surface where it's okay to make stains.  tip the bottle over to empty out any nail polish that will come out on its own.  add a few drops of nail polish thinner or paint thinner in the bottle if there are dried-up remnants of nail polish.  add some acetone to finish cleaning out all polish residue.  allow to dry fully.  allow to dry fully again.  if you need the brush, it will get cleaned as you clean the bottle but may need additional cleaning upon closer inspection, so always check.

 While facing a stretch bar or similar object, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees loose. Grab the stretch bar with your left hand.   If you do not have a stretch bar, use the handle of a closed door, the edge of a desk, or any other stationary, steady object between waist and chest height. You'll start by stretching the ligaments in the right half of your lower body, so you'll need to grab the stretch bar with your left hand to maintain proper balance. When stretching the ligaments in the left side of your lower body, grab the bar with your right hand.  Slowly bend your right knee and lift your right foot toward your back. Bring the right foot to the leg's end range, then hold it with your right hand.   In this stance, you should be able to work on your quads (thighs) and knees. You should feel the muscles in both areas stretch to the point of mild discomfort, but not to the point of pain. Your back and left leg should remain straight, but do not lock your left knee. Every part of your body other than your lower right leg should continue facing the bar.  Keep your leg bent back for 30 complete seconds, then gradually lower it back down to the floor.   The first 15 to 20 seconds of the stretch will target the muscles, but afterward, the muscles will relax and the ligaments will begin to stretch. Return your right foot to the floor over several seconds. Avoid using sudden or jerky movements since they may cause more damage to the area.  Repeat the same procedure with the left leg. Bend it back to its end range, hold for 30 seconds, and gradually release it.   While stretching the left leg, hold onto the bar with your right hand and hold your foot in place with your left hand. Switching sides will allow you to target and stress the ligaments in both legs.  

hold something steady.  bend your right leg back.  hold the position for 30 seconds.  repeat with the left leg. 

 To calculate the gross income of a supporting parent, you must add up the total amount of the person’s monthly income from whatever source. Sources of income can include but are not limited to:   Compensation for services, including fees, commissions, fringe benefits, and similar items; Income derived from a business; Any gains derived from property deals; Interest earned; Income from rents, royalties or dividends; Alimony and separate maintenance payments; Annuities and pensions; Income from life insurance and endowment contracts; Income from discharge of indebtedness; Distributive share of partnership gross income; Income in respect of a decedent Income from an interest in an estate or trust.; , Once you have determined the person’s gross income, you can calculate the net income by subtracting from the gross income all allowable deductions. The amount left is the net income.   Deduct federal and state income taxes and Social Security. Deduct mandatory retirement contributions required by law or as a condition of employment (do not include voluntary contributions to a 401k or other retirement fund). Deduct union dues. Deduct dependent and individual health insurance premiums. Deduct life insurance premiums that were court ordered to secure support payments. Deduct any prior obligations of support or maintenance that are paid pursuant to court order. Deduct foster care payments paid by the Department of Children and Family Services. Deduct the monthly amount spent to repay certain debts, such as student loan payments or necessary medical benefits.To determine the amount of monthly income taxes and Social Security deductions, look at a person’s pay stub to see how much is withheld on a monthly basis. Even if a parent claims that he or she does not have any income, a judge may still order the person to pay child support. The judge will order child support if he or she finds that the parent could be making more money or earning an income but is failing to do so because they are not really looking for a job or they are deliberately choosing low-paying positions for which they are overqualified., Under the State of Illinois’ child support guidelines, the noncustodial parent is required to pay a percentage of his or her net income in child support. The percentage a person is required to pay increases with the number of children.   The allowable percentage for one child is 20%. The allowable percentage for two children is 28%. The allowable percentage for three children is 32%. The allowable percentage for four children is 40%. The allowable percentage for five children is 45%. The allowable percentage for six or more children is 50%., You can calculate the amount of child support by first moving the decimal point two spots to the left of the percent amount (20% becomes .20) and then multiply that number by the monthly net income amount. For example, 1000 x .20 = $200 in monthly child support. This calculation of child support is used whether you are applying for long-term or temporary child support.   You can also calculate the percentage using a free online percentage calculator at http://www.percentagecalculator.net. The amount of child support will be set forth in a judge’s order (discussed in more detail below)., Under Illinois law, a court may deviate from the standard child support percentage and consider other factors that may either increase or decrease a parent’s contribution to child support. In a parent’s Petition for Child Support (discussed in more detail below), a person can specifically ask the court to increase or decrease child support and set forth the reasons for this deviation from the standard percentage. In his or her Response to the Petition for Child Support, a parent can set forth his or her arguments against considering the additional expenses. If the court finds the parent’s request for additional support to be reasonable, the court may consider the following expenses in adjusting the amount of child support:   Health needs not covered by insurance Child care Education Extracurricular activities, There are online calculators that are designed to assist you in calculating the amount of child support that a noncustodial parent must pay. These calculators ask you a number of questions and then calculate the amount based on your responses. You can locate an online calculator at http://www.alllaw.com/calculators/childsupport/illinois. You can also use the “Calculating Child Support Obligation Form” located at https://www.illinois.gov/hfs/ChildSupport/Documents/hfsweb016.pdf. Generally, you will be asked to provide the following information:   The number of children for whom the noncustodial parent is the legal parent and for whom you are seeking support. Income of the noncustodial parent. Monthly cost of family group health insurance paid by the noncustodial parent. Amount of monthly alimony paid by a noncustodial parent to the spouse from a prior marriage. Amount of monthly child support paid by the noncustodial parent for children from a prior marriage The county in which you live, In order to calculate a noncustodial parent’s net income, you need access to his or her financial information. If the child’s noncustodial parent denies his parentage, you may need a legal determination of parentage in order for the noncustodial parent to be compelled by the court to turn over his financial information. If you have never been married and you are seeking child support, you should establish legal parentage of the noncustodial parent in order to have a child support determination based on the person’s financials., Only legal parents are obligated to pay child support. You are a legal parent if: you are a biological parent of the child, you adopted a child, or you were married to the biological mother at the time of birth and therefore you are considered the presumed legal parent.If you accept that you are the legal parent but you were not married at the time the child was born, you can voluntarily establish legal parentage.   To establish voluntary legal parentage, you must have the biological mother’s agreement and complete the Voluntary Acknowledgment of Paternity (VAP) form, which is located at: https://www.illinois.gov/hfs/ChildSupport/Documents/hfs3416b.pdf. Both the father and mother must sign the form. You must then file the signed original form with Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) by sending it to: Administrative Coordination Unit (ACU), 110 West Lawrence Avenue, Springfield, Illinois 62704. The form can be signed either before or after the child’s birth, and is effective either when the child is born or when the document is filed with HFS, whichever is later. You can not use this form if you are a same-sex couple., If the mother of your child is married or was married within 300 days of when the child was born, you can take steps to establish your legal parentage. In addition to completing and having the mother of your child sign the Voluntary Acknowledgment of Paternity (discussed above), you must also have the mother’s spouse sign a denial of parentage.   You must do this even if the mother states that you are the biological parent of the child. You can download a Voluntary Denial of Paternity form at: https://www.illinois.gov/hfs/ChildSupport/Documents/hfs3416d.pdf  The husband has the right to seek genetic confirmation that he is not the biological father of the child., If you were never married to the other parent, you can file a Petition to Establish Parentage.

The document will have a return date, which is the date by which they must respond to the petition. The parent can respond by showing up in court on the return date., Once the respondent parent is served, you can contact the local court clerk to schedule a hearing date on your Petition. The clerk will provide you with a date and you must fill out and mail a copy of the Notice of Hearing to the respondent spouse.   Fill out the document and make two copies.

 In order to catch up on sleep, we need to know how much we've lost. Sleep debt is a real thing,and it's just as likely to develop over an extended period of minor sleep deprivation as it is from one or two all-nighters. If you can, take note of how much you sleep per night for two weeks, as that should paint a fairly accurate portrait of your sleep debt, and provide a basis for you to adjust your routine.; , Eight hours is the optimal amount of sleep for the average person, and while your actual needs may deviate slightly from the norm, it's best to be safe and aim for eight hours or more., On average, Americans sleep 6.8 hours per night during the week, and 7.4 hours per night on the weekends, which averages out to 6.9 hours total per night.That means in one week, a typical American adult accumulates 7.7 hours of sleep debt. How much do you accumulate?  , It's common that people deprive themselves of sleep during the week, and then try to make it up on the weekends. But is that enough? If you sleep 6 hours per night Sunday-Thursday, then "catch up" on the weekends by sleeping 11 hours per night, you're still coming up 4 hours short every week—that's 200+ hours of sleep debt every year.  In a perfect world, we would simply allocate an extra hour or two every day for sleep, but that's not always possible. However, you might be able to find time sporadically. If your schedule requires that you sleep 6 hours Monday, Wednesday, Friday, try to sleep 8 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays. It might not seem like much, but those few extra hours will supplement your elongated weekend sleeps, and greatly reduce your debt.  Generally speaking, if you're napping for over an hour, you're better off not napping at all.There are exceptions to this—e.g. shift-workers who simply have no other option. But if you're planning on sleeping that night, daytime naps are counterproductive. In the typical nap, you spend very little time, if any, in a state of REM sleep.REM sleep is the most regenerative and refreshing type of sleep, and without it your nap does nothing to work off your sleep debt, not to mention that it will make it more difficult to fall asleep for the night.  Sleep hygiene is a way of measuring the quality of your sleep. Just like personal hygiene, you can improve it by tweaking your daily habits. While most of the behaviors pertinent to sleep hygiene are things we do right before bed, the process begins as soon as we wake up in the morning. All of the following steps contribute to achieving the most hygienic sleep possible. , While some people believe alcohol helps them sleep, the truth is just the opposite. Alcohol negatively affects sleep quality in two ways:It reduces the quantity of REM sleep for the first several hours of sleep, which causes a massive decrease in sleep quality. When it wears off, 4-6 hours after sleep begins, it creates a stimulating effect in the sleeper, which can make him or her wake up and have trouble falling back asleep.  Most people know not to drink coffee before going to sleep, but it's important to avoid caffeine in any form. Other caffeinated substances to avoid before bed include:Chocolate Non-Cola Sodas Weight Loss Pills Pain Relievers Decaf Coffee  , Spicy foods, in particular, are problematic before bed. But it's not a good idea to eat any large meal before going to sleep. The digestive process can upset your body's natural sleep sequences, and reduce the quality of your sleep., For the most part, exercise actually improves your quality of sleep. However, exercise before bad can have a stimulating effect, and limit your ability to fall asleep. It should be noted, though, that some experts believe calmer forms of exercise, like yoga, improve sleep hygiene, regardless of when the exercise is performed., Ideally, we subconsciously associate our beds with sleep, and our bodies begin to ready themselves for sleep as soon we get into bed. These associations can be disrupted if you fall into the habit of reading, working, or watching TV in bed, and you may have a harder time falling asleep at night., Television is the most common mental stimulant in which people engage before trying to fall asleep, but it's not the only one. While some experts suggest reading before bed, others argue that it can have the same stimulating effects as television or work.  The idea is to get your body used to certain sleeping conditions, so that your body will naturally ready itself for sleep when exposed to those conditions. Consider all of the following:   Use your favorite bedding. Adjust the room to your preferred temperature, and sleep that way every night. Black out as much noise and light as possible. 

keep track of the amount you sleep.  assume that you should be getting eight hours of sleep per night.  calculate how much you're really sleeping per night.  think about your strategy for catching up on sleep.  check your weekly schedule for sleep openings.  eliminate long naps.  understand sleep hygiene.  don't drink alcohol before bed.  avoid caffeine before bed.  avoid large meals and dietary changes before bed.  avoid exercise immediately before bed.  don't use your bed for anything besides sleep.  avoid television and other mental stimulants before bed.  establish a consistent and soothing sleeping environment. 

 Fighting back greatly increases your odds of losing your life.   If you have not been trained by the military, the police or endured extensive martial arts training specifically in the area of disarming an opponent, the safest option when faced with a handgun is to do whatever the person says, with the exception of entering a vehicle with the attacker. You are gambling with your life in this situation, it is not the movies, and in almost all cases, your attacker will have more experience in this kind of situation than you do. Be aware that the most common mistake made by potential victims in cases like these is over confidence. Over confidence leads to the vast majority of deaths. The second most common mistake is fighting back. However, there are times when you may calculate that you need to do so. For example, let's say you're caught up in a school shooting where it's obvious the attacker's goal is simply to kill as many people as possible.; , If you've decided that you need to disarm the criminal because it's likely you will be shot otherwise, spin the gun away from you. This technique is very dangerous. Do not attempt it if you are not properly trained, unless absolutely necessary.   The goal is to make sure the gun is pointed away from your body as you grab it, and spin it away.Continue the energy you’ve created by twisting the arm with the gun around you to the right as you face away from where the criminal was originally positioned. Now, flip the gunman on the ground as you spin to the right while holding the gunman’s arm. Keep your hand on the attacking arm, and take the gun. You can also step over the gunman and hold his arm with your leg.  Twist the gun down, breaking the criminal’s finger as you do it. Remember, the criminal’s finger will be in the trigger.   Twist the gun to the right. All of these maneuvers are dangerous if the criminal is stronger than you and also risk the gun firing and striking other people in the area. Take the gun from the criminal's wounded hand. Use the right hand to stop the wrist as you use the left hand to bend their wrist, grab the gun, and push the gun down. This is very important. If you don’t grab their wrist before twisting the gun down, you will risk them maintaining control of the gun.  Turn around, and step in and under their arm, and rip the gun out of the criminal’s hand.   You could do either of the first two steps next; either, you will want to twist the gun in the criminal’s hand, breaking his finger. Or just rip the gun out of their hand. Move the left hand on the side of the attacker’s gun and at the same time move your body to the attacker’s right side.Before you do this, wave your hands as if surrendering and saying don’t shoot. After moving your left hand to the side of the attacker’s gun, take a right counter-clockwise circular step in between the attacker’s feet while turning the gun toward the attacker. Your wrist should lock the attacker’s right hand, and turn the gun at the attacker’s throat, bringing the attacker to the ground. In each of these moves, the goal is to reposition the gun before twisting it from the gunman's hand.  You must take control of the weapon so the gunman cannot redirect it at you. This will unfold fast, and the gunman will try to regain control. Burst in forward. Put your weight inward and downward on the gun. You are trying to get the weapon down and inward to limit the ability of the attacker to move it. Move your feet to keep putting weight on the weapon no matter how the criminal reacts. You will want to use your hip muscles and body weight to torque an opponent’s wrist to take them down. In one move, put enormous pressure on the attacker’s wrist, forcing them down to the ground while placing strong control of the weapon. You can kick the criminal to the head, midsection or groin to remove the weapon.Or reach over the attacker’s shoulder and clench the rifle’s butt stock. Insert your right hand with the thumb pointed toward the ground to grasp the weapon’s stock. Yank the weapon toward you to weaken the attacker’s leverage and yank it shortly up. Wrench the weapon away.  

be aware that your goal in a situation like this is to save your life.  grab their arm at the wrist.  grab the gun directly from the hand.  disarm a gun pointed at your back.  control the weapon.

 Ultraviolet rays are strongest and most intense between the hours of 10:00 am and 3:00 pm. If at all possible, try to avoid going out into the sun during those peak hours. If you must go out during that time, make sure you take preventative measures to protect your skin from UV radiation., Sunscreen protects you from the sun's radiation, but not all sunscreen is the same. Many sunscreen products only protect against one type of radiation, but your skin can be damaged by both UVA and UVB radiation. Health experts recommend that you use broad-spectrum sunscreen, which guards your skin against both types of radiation.Choose sunscreen with a sun-protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher. Sunscreen doesn't necessarily work instantaneously. Make sure you apply sunscreen about 15 to 30 minutes before you plan on being out in the sun. Reapply sunscreen at least every two hours. If you go swimming or sweat a lot, you should reapply sunscreen more frequently. When you are around water, the reflection from the water can increase the strength of the sun's rays, increasing the chance of sun damage. Use sunscreen even when the day is gloomy or overcast. Applying sunscreen can also help prevent existing sunspots from becoming darker.  In addition to wearing broad-spectrum sunscreen whenever you're in the sun, you should also wear protective clothing to limit your skin's exposure to UV radiation. Reducing exposure and protecting your skin is the only proven way to lower the chances of sunspots developing.Brimmed hats, long-sleeved shirts, long skirts/pants, and sunglasses can all help protect your skin from the sun.Choose tightly-knit fabrics, which are better at guarding your skin. You can also buy clothing that is designed to protect against UV radiation. Some articles of clothing can provide ultraviolet protection factors of 50 or higher.  Smoking (and secondhand exposure to tobacco smoke) has been linked to premature aging of the skin.Because of this, some experts advise that you should avoid smoking if you want to prevent sunspots and other skin conditions associated with aging. 

stay out of the sun during peak uv hours.  use broad-spectrum sunscreen any time you're in the sun.  wear protective clothing in the sun.  avoid smoking. 

 Take some time to clean your mower. Remove any leftover grass, dirt, and other debris. You can use a mixture of soapy water to wipe down all of the different parts on your mower. You may want to lubricate the metal parts, too.; , Remove any oil or gas that's been sitting in your mower throughout the winter. Make sure that you dispose of the oil properly. Then, you can top off the oil and gas for your mower to the correct levels.  If you notice any rust, replace the spark plugs. If not, remove them and take the time to clean them off.  Replace them, as necessary. You can also use a metal file to sharpen the blades to ensure that they'll cut your grass properly.  Look for signs of cracking. You can replace the belts if you notice any damage or signs of wear.  

clean the lawnmower.  add oil and gas.  check the spark plugs for signs of rust.  check the blades for signs of chips.  make sure that the belt isn't too loose. 

 Here's what you'll need for apple cake:   3/4 cup flour 3/4 teaspoon baking powder 4 apples 2 eggs 3/4 cup sugar Pinch of salt 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted  ,, For this recipe you can use a standard cake pan or a springform pan, which has removable sides and is nice if you're serving the cake at a party.  It should come to room temperature before you incorporate it with the other ingredients.  Place the flour, salt and baking powder in a bowl and whisk them together.  Use a knife or a vegetable peeler to peel the apples, then remove their cores. Slice the apples into bite-sized chunks.  Mix together the sugar, eggs, butter, and vanilla.  Stir until the batter is smooth and creamy.  Use a spatula to gently incorporate the apples into the batter. Don't over mix the batter, since this will lead to a dense, stiff cake.

gather your ingredients.  preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  ,  grease your cake pan.  melt the butter and allow it to cool.  stir the dry ingredients in a small bowl.  prepare the apples.  blend the wet ingredients.  add the dry mixture to the wet mixture.  fold in the apples.  pour the batter into the pan.  bake the cake for about 50 minutes.  serve the cake with whipped cream. 

 While you probably want to leave your parents out of conflicts with your sister whenever possible, they can play an important role in maintaining harmony between the two of your. Ask your parents to establish ground rules so both you and your older sister understand exactly what sort of behavior is tolerated in your home. Even more importantly, though, make sure your parents establish what the consequences are for breaking the rules.If you're not sure what how to ask your parents for comprehensive rules, you might say, "I want to make sure that we all know what behavior is acceptable and what isn't. Could you please set down some ground rules?" You may want to ask your parents to establish a procedure for how to report rule violations too. You don’t want your sister to accuse you of tattling every time you try to alert your parents to her behavior.  One of the worst parts of being a younger sibling is having to deal with hand-me-downs. Whether it’s clothing, sports equipment, or electronics, it’s no fun when you’re always getting your sister’s old things while she gets new items just because she’s older. Explain to your parents how you feel, and see if it’s possible to limit the number of hand-me-downs that you receive.It’s important to be mindful of the fact that money sometimes plays a role in how many hand-me-downs you get. Don’t expect your parents to buy you all new items if your sister’s are still in good condition. If you're unsure how to broach the subject with your parents, you might say, "It really makes me feel like an afterthought when I have to wear all of my sister's old clothes.May I pick out a new shirt/dress/pair of pants for the party next week?"  , The best way to ensure that everyone in the family gets along is to set aside a specific time to address concerns and problems. Ask your parents if you can hold weekly or monthly family meetings where everyone can talk about what’s bothering them. That way, if there’s an issue with your sister that she’s not aware of or vice versa, you have neutral ground to discuss it, with your parents on hand to moderate.Explain to your parents that you think it's important for everyone in the family to have a chance to share their feelings. You might say, "I think we'll all be able to get along better if we clear the air on a regular basis." You don’t want family meetings to have a confrontational feel, so it often helps to make them feel more casual and fun. You might hold them on a night when you’re eating out as a family or having pizza delivered. That can help make the meeting something that you all look forward to.  

push for ground rules.  ask to limit hand-me-downs.  suggest family meetings.

 Present a picture to the financial aid committee of who you are. Describe special family circumstances, such as whether you are the first in your family to attend college. State whether you come from a disadvantaged family. Mention if you are from an ethnic group that is under-represented at the school.For example, you could write the following: “My parents moved to the United States from Albania in order to give us better opportunities. As their oldest child, I will be the first in our family to attend college.”; , Describe your financial situation. Tell if you are currently working to support yourself. Describe other sources of support you are currently receiving, such as from your family. Provide details about any college savings that you have, such as a 529 College Savings Plan.For example, write something like this: “I have worked to help support my family since I was 16 years old. Currently, I work on the weekends as a waitress to support myself. My parents also give me what they can each month. Since my parents didn’t speak English when we moved here, it was very difficult for them to support our family. My mother worked many hours as a housekeeper in a hotel. They saved what they could, but we do not have enough savings to pay for my college education."  , Explain difficulties you are having meeting your needs. Describe changes in your life that have affected your ability to pay for college. For example, changes in your family’s income or unexpected expenses may have caused a financial deficit. Provide evidence that you can handle your finances responsibly. Tell how you have paid some of your tuition yourself through your own efforts. Avoid details about paying for expenses other than education, such as car loans, as this is irrelevant.For example: “My earnings from my weekend job cover my living expenses. I worked extra shifts over the summer and saved enough to pay for a portion of this year’s tuition. However, I am seeking aid for the portion of the tuition I cannot cover on my own.”  , Explain how you will make good use of the financial aid you receive. Benefits might include being able to concentrate more on studying instead of working. The financial aid may allow you to take advantage of an unpaid internship. It may even make the difference between graduating or having to drop out.For example: “Receiving financial aid will allow me to focus on my studies during the week without having to worry about earning extra money. I would continue to work on the weekends to cover my living expenses, but I would be able to keep the weekdays free to focus solely on my school work.”  , Use a professional and polite tone. Avoid begging or being highly emotional. Awarding financial aid is a responsibility that schools take very seriously. Recognize this with a concise conclusion that thanks the committee for their time.For example: “Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing my opportunities with you.”  

write the introduction.  explain how you are currently paying for college.  justify why you are seeking aid.  describe how you would benefit from the financial aid.  write a closing statement. 

 It's common sense that video games will have a price drop soon after it's initial release. So basically waiting for it to lower the price will save those costly extra amounts that you had to pay for. It can often drop as much as $10 per month, depending on popularity.; , If you check out any of the used games, you'll noticed they're slightly cheaper than new copies. Though watch out, this isn't always true. Some thrift shops will give them the same price as one that is brand new.  Since you obviously need money to buy games, you need to find a way to save enough money to buy the games you wanted.  It's always best to do your research. Perhaps go to YouTube and look at the game videos online and see reviews. Find ways to see if this game really is good before buying, as you might regret buying it if it didn't live up to your expectations. If you want to buy this game only because you want to know what happens next, even if it has bad gameplay, don't. You can often find complete guides and walkthroughs on YouTube or other sites like it.  You might find the same games for a much cheaper price.  If you have a user on any online shopping sites (Amazon, EBay, etc.) you can often get games even cheaper than thrift stores.  

don't buy it near its release date.  consider buying pre-owned or used.  save your money.  decide whether or not if you really want the game.  don't just go to one location.  try online.

 Listen to the way people talk to one another and use those conversations and patterns in your dialogue to make it sound authentic. You'll notice that people talk differently when they're with different people, so make sure that you include that when you're writing dialogue.   Disregard parts of the conversation that will not translate well when written down. For example, every "hello" and "goodbye" does not need to be written. Some of your dialogue might start with a "Did you do 'this'?" or "Why did you do 'this'?"; , To get a good feel for the balance that you need in your dialogue between realistic speech and book speech you need to read good dialogue in books and in movies. Look at books and scripts and see what works and what doesn't and try to figure out why.A few writers to check out for their dialogue are Douglas Adams, Toni Morrison, and Judy Blume (these are only a few; there are lots!). Their dialogue tends to be realistic, layered, and vivid. Checking out and practicing writing dialogue for screenplays and radio plays is really useful in developing dialogue, since those are both very dependent on dialogue. Douglas Adams, from the above writers, got his start in writing radio plays which is one reason for his fantastic dialogue.  You will need to completely understand your characters before you can make them talk. You'll need to know things like whether they're taciturn and monosyllabic, or whether they love to use lots of big words to impress people, and so on.Things like age, gender, education level, region where they're from, tone of voice, will all make a difference in how a character talks. For example, a poor American teen girl is going to talk very differently from a rich, old, British guy. Give each character a distinct voice. Not all of your characters are going to use the same vocabulary, tone or method of speech. Make sure each character sounds different.  Stilted dialogue might not completely kill a story, but it can definitely jerk a reader out of the story, which as a writer, is something you're trying not to do. Occasionally stilted dialogue does work, but only with the most specific kind of story.Stilted dialogue is dialogue that only works on the obvious levels and in language no one would use. For example: "Hello, Jane, you look sad today," said Charles. "Yes, Charles, I am sad today. Would you like to know why?" "Yes, Jane, I would like to know why you are sad today." "I am sad because my dog is sick and it reminds me of the death of my father two years ago under mysterious circumstances." How the dialogue above should have gone: "Jane, is something wrong?" asked Charles. Jane shrugged, keeping her gaze fixed on something out the window. "My dog's sick. They don't know what's wrong." "That's terrible, but, Jane...well, he is old. Maybe that's all it is." Her hands clenched on the windowsill. "It's just, it's just, you'd think the doctors would know." "You mean the vet?" Charles frowned. "Yeah. Whatever." The reason the second one works better, is that it doesn't come right out and say that Jane is thinking of her deceased father, but it does lean towards that interpretation, especially with her using the word "doctors" instead of "vet." It also flows better. An example where stilted dialogue works is Lord of the Rings. The dialogue isn't always stilted, especially when it's the hobbits talking, but can get very grand and eloquent (and unrealistic). The only reason this works (and many people don't agree that it does work!) is that the story is supposed to be in the style of old epics like Beowulf or The Mabinogion.  Use "he said" or "she answered" instead of lofty terms like "he protested" or "she exclaimed." You do not want to take away from the dialogue between characters with unusual words or tags. "Said" is one of those invisible words that won't distract the reader.Occasionally it's okay to break up the "said" and "answered" or "responded" where it's appropriate. For example, you could use "interrupted" or "shouted" or "whispered" but only where it's appropriate for the story and only occasionally.  It should provide information to the reader about the story or the characters. Dialogue is a great way to prove character development or character information that your reader might not otherwise get.   Don't do small talk about the weather or how each character is doing, even if that's something that comes up a lot in real conversations. Now, a way in which small talk would be well used is to build up tension. For example, a character really needs certain information from another character, but the second character insists upon the ritual of small talk, your reader and your character will be biting their nails in waiting to get to the good stuff. All your dialogue should have a purpose. As you're writing dialogue, ask yourself, "what does this add to the story?" "What am I trying to tell the reader about the character or the story?" If you don't have an answer to those questions, scrap the dialogue.  This is a big one that a lot of people have the tendency to do. You think, what better way to get information across to my reader than by having my characters discuss it at length? Hold it right there! Background information needs to be added sporadically throughout the story.   For example of what not to do: Jane turned to Charles and said, "Oh Charles, remember when my father died a mysterious death and my family was turned out of our home by my evil aunt Agatha?" "I do remember that, Jane. You were only 12-years-old and you had to drop out of school to help out your family." A better version of the above might go something like: Jane turned to Charles, her lips set in a grim line. "I heard from aunt Agatha today." Charles was taken aback. "But she was the one that kicked your family out of your house. What did she want?" "Who knows, but she started hinted things about my dad's death." "Things?" Charles raised an eyebrow. "She seemed to think his death wasn't natural."  , Conversations, especially in stories, are layered affairs. There's usually more than one thing going on in them, so you want to make sure that you capture the subtext of each situation.   There are lots of ways to say things. So, if you have a character that you want to say something like "I need you," try having them say as much, without actually saying it. For example: Charles started for his car. Jane placed a hand on his arm; she was chewing at her lip. "Charles, I...do you really have to go so soon?" she asked, withdrawing her hand. "We still haven't figured out what we're going to do." Don't have your characters say everything they're feeling or thinking. That will give away too much and won't allow for any suspense, or nuance.  You want your dialogue to be interesting and to keep your reader engaged in the story. This means skimming over background conversations, like people at the bus stop discussing the weather, and getting into the meaty conversations, like Jane's confrontation with treacherous Aunt Agatha.   Engage your characters in arguments or have them say surprising things, as long as these things are in character for them. Dialogue should be interesting. If everyone is agreeing or asking and answering basic questions, the dialogue will get boring. Intersperse your dialogue with action. When people are having conversations they fiddle with things, laugh, wash the dishes, trip over things, and so on. Adding these things to the dialogue will make it come alive. For example: "You don't think a healthy specimen like your daddy would've just sickened and died," Aunt Agatha said with a cackle. Jane clung to the shreds of her temper, replying "Sometimes people get sick." "And sometimes they get a little help from their friends." Aunt Agatha sounded so smug Jane wanted to reach through the phone and wring her neck. "if someone killed him, Aunt Agatha, do you know who?" "Oh, I've got a few notions, but I'll let you decide on your own."  , This will give you an opportunity to hear how it sounds. You can make changes based on what you hear as well as what you read. Allow a little time to go by after you've written the dialogue to read it, otherwise your brain will fill in what you were going for rather than what is actually on the page.   Have a trusted friend or family member go over your dialogue. A fresh pair of eyes can tell you whether your dialogue is natural sounding, or needs work.  There is nothing more irritating to a reader (including and especially, publishers and agents) than punctuation that is being abused, especially in dialogue.   There should be a comma after the end of the dialogue and the closing quotation mark. For example: "Hello. I'm Jane," said Jane. If you add action to the middle of a piece of dialogue, you'll either capitalize the second half of the dialogue, or not. For example: "I can't believe he killed my father," Jane said, her eyes filling with tears. "It's just not like him." or "I can't believe he killed my father," Jane said, her eyes filling with tears, "since it's just not like him." If there's no said, only an action, then there's a period in place of a comma in the closing quotation mark. For example: "Goodbye, Aunt Agatha." Jane slammed the phone down.  Sometimes, less dialogue is more. When people talk, they are not overly verbose. They say things in short, simple ways and you'll want to reflect that in your dialogue.   For example, instead of "I cannot believe that all these many years, it was Uncle Red that put the poison in my father's evening cocktail and murdered him," said Jane, you might say "I can't believe Uncle Red poisoned my father!"  , Each character should have her own sound and voice, but too much of an accent or a drawl will become annoying to readers. Also, using a dialect you aren't familiar with can end up employing stereotypes and being incredibly offensive to the natural speakers of the dialect.   Establish where characters come from in other ways. For example, use regional terms such as "soda" versus "pop" to establish geography. Make sure if you're writing a character from a specific geographic area (like England or America) that you use the appropriate slang and terminology (pants in England, underwear in America, for example).  

pay attention to actual conversations.  read good dialogue.  develop your characters fully.  learn to avoid stilted dialogue.  keep it simple.  move the story forward with your dialogue.  don't info dump in your dialogue.  add subtext.  mix it up.  read your dialogue out loud.  punctuate your speech correctly.  cut out any unnecessary words or phrases.  use dialect carefully. 

 If you’re out all day and can’t get someone to monitor your dog, you should try to at least limit the damage in the event your dog can’t wait to void until you return. You can do this by putting your dog in a single room, preferably one with a vinyl or tile floor that is easily cleaned up. If you don’t want to give your dog the run of the whole room, you can limit its space even further by placing it in a smaller nook or in a hallway and placing a baby gate (or gates) in a strategic location to keep your dog confined to the smaller space.Rooms with carpets are not preferred since they are difficult to clean up if your dog soils them.; , If your dog needs to go to the bathroom more often, the easiest thing to do is to put it out more often. Provide opportunities for your dog to go out when it wakes up and before it goes to sleep, especially. Come home doing your lunch break, if possible, to let your dog out.If it is not possible to let your dog out frequently during the middle of the day, ask a family member or trusted neighbor to let your dog out while you’re at work or school.  You may want to give your dog an indoor option for the times when he can’t hold it. Some things you might try include:   Getting a doggy litter box. Set up a large litter box for your dog. If you notice that he is about to soil in the house, then take him to the litter box. Do this a few times and he may begin to understand that the litter box is an option for him if you are not there to let him out. Placing puppy pads or newspaper around the house. You can also show your dog these options when he seems like he is about to soil in the house.  Not only can a dog sitter let your dog out more frequently, but they can be there to relieve your dog’s anxiety due to being alone. Feelings of loneliness can contribute to an increase in your dog’s house soiling, especially in older dogs who might be more fearful due to a decline in their senses.If you have a family member who can be home with your older dog during the day, you should be able to reduce the number of house soiling incidents your dog has. If you don’t have a family member who can help out, hire a pet sitter. You can find pet sitters both online through classifieds and through the recommendations of your friends who also have pets. Sometimes you can get neighbors or their teens to pet-sit for you. Ensure that your pet sitter, neighbor, or family member understands that your pet is older and needs special attention.  If your older dog suddenly feels it does not have enough space, it might start house soiling in order to mark its territory. For example, if you recently had a baby, obtained another pet, or got married, your dog might now feel cramped for space. Provide your dog with a spacious crate and/or comfortable dog bed where it feels secure. Your dog can retreat there to self-soothe when it feels stressed and house-soiling incidents will (hopefully) decline., Doggie diapers are like regular diapers, wearable items designed to manage your older dog’s accidents. This should be the last thing you try and you should consult your dog’s veterinarian first. To use the doggie diapers, slip your dog’s rear legs through the diaper, lift it up and around its rear end, then seal the diaper using the built-in sealing mechanism.Doggie diapers are single-use and available at most pet stores. Consult manufacturer directions for more information about how to use your doggie diaper.

 If you want to let someone down easy, timing and location matter. If you're seeking to let someone down in an empathetic matter, take some time to consider the proper location and timeframe to talk to them.   Face-to-face is ideal for difficult conversations. Humans evolved to pick up on non-verbal cues and signals that are reassuring during difficult conversations. An impromptu pat on the shoulder, for example, can reassure someone he or she is essentially lovable even if this one relationship did not work out. A look of sadness on your face can help your partner see you truly care about his or her feelings, despite the fact you feel the relationship should end.If possible, choose to have the talk at a place where your significant other feels comfortable. Choose to stop by his or her apartment to talk, for example. It may feel uncomfortable for you but giving someone a slight sense of power during a difficult conversation can help him or her digest bad news.If you anticipate a long conversation, try to choose a time where the conversation will not be cut short by external factors. Do not, for example, break up with your longterm boyfriend an hour before he has to leave for work. Instead, choose to stop by his place shortly after dinner on a weeknight. This will allow any lingering loose threads to be addressed.; , If you're letting someone down easy, you need to take full responsibility for your decision. Oftentimes, people feel it will be easier if their partner initiates the breakup. However, you are the one whose feelings have changed. It's your responsibility to start the breakup conversation. Trying to lead your partner to the conclusion, that you want to break up, through subtle cues is not only dishonest it can be confusing. Your partner may not get the message and begin to question him or herself as you subtly pull away.For example, if you become less physically affectionate in order to show your partner you're losing interest your partner might question his or her own attractiveness. If you want to let someone down easy, you need to take full responsibility of your decision.  It's best to be honest when letting someone down. While you do not have to go over every single reason you want out, it's important to be direct about your expectations. Make it clear you want to end the relationship and give your partner a brief explanation as to why.   The essential message that most breakups boil down to is, "You're not what I'm looking for." It's perfectly okay to express this. This will allow the recipient to have a sense of closure as he or she will understand your reasoning. It's okay to gently say something like, "I'm sorry, but I'm not in love with you anymore. I need something different right now and I think we should go our separate ways." If it's a less serious relationship, you can keep the statement briefer. Something like, "Sorry, but I'm not feeling a significant spark between us. I think we would be better off friends."Honesty is important, but it does not have to be brutal. It's not a good idea to go over your partner's past mistakes or current pitfalls. If you're leaving because you're no longer attracted to your partner, for example, this might be best unsaid. If you have lingering feelings of resentment over past arguments, it may feel cathartic to let this out. However, this is painful for your partner to hear. If you want to let someone down easy, keep your statements for ending the relationship general and do not go into excessive details about your partner's flaws or drawbacks as a match., Once again, while it's great to be honest you should also be direct. You are not doing your partner any good by beating around the bush and avoiding the subject at hand. Start the conversation off with a direct declaration of what you want, something like, "I wanted to talk to you because I don't feel this relationship is working out." From there, try to keep the conversation brief.   Letting someone down can be difficult but remaining calm and collected is important. This way, you'll be able to get your words out in a concise manner. Becoming overly emotional can result in confusing rambling, obscuring the message at hand. Try to spend some time emotionally preparing for the conversation by running over a script in your head.You could write down some of what you plan to say. While memorizing a speech may not be the best route, this can make you come off as cold, having some idea of what you can to say can help you focus. Practice your words a few times before the confrontation., Offering some kind of consolation at the end of a relationship can help reduce the sting of the blow. If possible, offer friendship to your ex. Say something like, "I hope we can stay friends." However, keep in mind many people struggle staying friends, especially in the direct wake of a breakup. If you do not think you can reasonably remain friends with someone, do not make the offer., When letting someone down easy, it's important to avoid anything your ex might find patronizing or insulting. Cliches, such as "It's not you, it's me," can feel dishonest. Instead, express yourself directly and abandon cliche language. Speaking to your own personal experience is best when letting someone down easy., You may feel some anger and resentment if you're choosing to end a relationship. It can tempting to attribute blame to your ex, especially if he or she hurt you. However, if you want to let your ex down easy playing the blame game is not a good idea.   Avoiding negativity of any kind is one of the best ways to spare someone's feelings. Going over past mistakes or resentments can spur an argument, resulting in an unclean and unpleasant breakup.If you suspect your partner may not take the breakup well, keep in mind he or she may try to blame you. Avoid being sucked into a negative conversation. If your partner tries to put you down for your actions, counter with something like, "I'm sorry you feel that way but it doesn't change my decision.", Social media can be particularly toxic in the wake of a breakup. If you want to let your ex down easy, avoid positing about the breakup online. Even accounts you think he or she might not access to could potentially discovered. While many find social media cathartic when coping with a breakup, keep in mind your ex's feelings may be hurt by what you choose to post. It may also be a good idea to stop following your ex on any social media platforms. During a breakup, you'll need time to cultivate some space between you and your partner to help you move on. Severing the social media tie a bit can help.  You can help yourself and your ex cope by choosing to focus on the positive. Towards the end of the breakup conversation, try to focus on mutual benefit.   Emphasize all the good things your partner has done for you. Make sure she leaves the conversation feeling like the relationship was worthwhile even if it did not work out. Say something like, "You really made me feel good about myself and pushed me to be a kinder, more empathetic person. I will always be grateful for that."Encourage gratitude. While acknowledge it may take some time, encourage your partner to cherish the good times you had together. Relationships are primarily social exchanges and people have a natural tendency to search for their benefits. Your partner will appreciate you helping him or her seek positives even as the relationship ends., As previously stated, it can be helpful to leave the door open for friendship. However, you do not want to give mixed messages. Be honest about what kind of contact you want to have with your ex. If you need some space before you can work on establishing a friendship, for example, say so. Do not try to force friendly meetings prematurely, as this can confuse you and your ex. You will need time and space before you're able to see one another without romantic attachments and associations., You will likely run into your ex at some point in the future. Be cordial and friendly during any encounters you might have. Remain emotionally prepared. Keep in mind as you go to work, school, and run errands you may run into your ex. This can help you stay calm and collected during the encounter.  When in love, many people convince themselves the person they're with is their one true love. However, you need to let those feelings go after a breakup. In reality, there are many people with whom you would be potentially compatible. You will likely find someone else in the future, despite what you may be feeling in the present moment. Allow yourself to accept the fact the relationship ended for a reason and you will find someone else in the future., If not, then don't end things. You need to mentally consider this as a break-up. Don't try and let someone down easy as an excuse to "keep your options open." Either you break up or you don't. Playing games with someone's emotions isn't fair or gentle.   If you hope that you can get them to break up with you, then don't try and let them down gently. You can't expect them to do the work for you -- you need to end things yourself. If they don't pick up on the hints or being gentle doesn't work, you need to be ready to step in and end the relationship firmly.  Your goals when splitting away from someone are important. If you don't want to see someone again, then you should just end the relationship quickly and kindly. If you're just trying to slow thing down a bit, a gentle let down is more appropriate.   A gentle let down can give someone the impression that you may want to rekindle things later in life. If you don't want this, end it quickly. If you're being gentle because you are worried about your safety, just end things quickly. Don't worry about being gentle. If you're worried about their reaction, bring a trusted friend along. If you've had some disagreements lately and just need some space, you should let them down gently, allowing you to resume friendship when the dust has settled.  All relationships have ups and downs, and it is easy to forget about the good times when you're in the bad. If you're trying to let her down because you've hit a rough patch, ask yourself if you really dislike her or just dislike your current state.   Don't rush into this decision. Wait 2-3 weeks to see if your feelings change. Many people like the "gentle let down" because it lets you change your mind later on. If you do keep changing your mind, however, you are likely in a short lull, not some relationship crisis. If you keep having the same old fights every day, then you should consider ending it once and for all.  While your gentle intentions are noble, and you still care for their feelings, ask yourself if you're really making things better with a protracted split. Sometimes you just need to rip the Band-Aid off. If you know that they're emotionally invested in your relationship and don't want things to end, you're not going to be gentle no matter what you do. Don't prolong this more than necessary.   If he seems distant as well, and you just don't feel the spark anymore, you should go ahead and let him down nice and gently.  If you've realized that this isn't fair, or isn't the best way to end things, you should weigh your other options. Consider:   Ending a manipulative or abusive relationship.  Ending a Friendship. Breaking up. Rekindling the relationship.  

choose an appropriate time and place.  take responsibility yourself.  be open and direct about your feelings.  keep it short.  offer friendship, if you're able.  speak without cliches.  do not place blame.  avoid social media in the direct aftermath.  focus on the good times.  be upfront about lessening contact.  act civil after the breakup.  resist thinking of your ex as your one true love.  are you sure that you want to end the relationship?,  are you trying to break contact completely, or just return to friendship?,  is your relationship in a lull, or fatally flawed?,  would a quick, clean break up be better for everyone?,  what can you do instead of a gentle let down?

 Having a squad will help you out greatly. Below are tactics.  Learn formations, spreads, and rules of engagement. Also, learn how to engage as a squad and also defensive tactics. A special operations squad should have a killing power far beyond it's physical size. Defending against a large group is difficult. One way you can defeat a large squad is by breaking contact and flanking. Your squad only has enough for a good 10 minutes of engagement before they are out of ammo. Be aware of this. In order to defeat a force larger then you, you have to keep calm and keep the fire on high. Listen to the amount of fire that your squad is receiving and the moment you hear that the fire is lowering, tell your squad  to do a center split. The goal is to break contact. One person will suppress the enemy as the rest of the squad falls back. After that person has suppressed the enemy for about 10 seconds, he will fall back and has he passes one of his squad mates, that squad mate will do what he did. Keep repeating this process until you have broken contact. Once that is achieved, you can ambush them and flank them. At this point you will want to kill them as fast as possible and progress as fast as possible to give them little time to form a line of defense.  Always have your squad ready to go. When stacking up, have them squeeze each others shoulder starting from the last in line to the point man. This ensures that everyone is ready and that the point man doesn't walk into a room alone.  Even better is to make up your own phrases for when your moving, when you tell your team to engage, etc. this will ensure that no enemy knows what you're doing if they happen to eves drop on you or your radio conversation. Use hand signals as much a possible and if you have to speak, make your phrases short. Before going to the field, ensure everyone knows the phrases so everyone knows what to do  , As they say in the SEALs: don't run to your death. Go slow and move silently. No point of rushing. Keep the element of surprise until the last minute. Don't flash bang through every door and yell everything your saying. Keep it silent. This not only prevents your squad from being compromised, but it also keeps the stress level down and allows your squad to perform a lot better.  

after you have some experience, consider getting a squad together for training and airsoft play.  practice with your squad.  cqc tactics.  use military language and call-signs.  take your time. 

 If this is the case, let your job or school know in advance that you will be absent as you will be spending most of Yom Kippur in the synagogue.; , They are as follows (in no particular order):   No eating or drinking No bathing or washing No wearing leather shoes No anointing (i.e. applying creams, lotion, makeup) No engaging in marital relations  , For this reason, eat a very filling pre-fast meal and drink plenty of fluids (ideally water) before the holiday starts.  The service lasts about an hour and a half altogether. Wear white if possible.  Depending on your level of observance, many people stay in the synagogue for the whole day, only leaving for a short break in the afternoon.

 There are a variety of skin “resurfacing” procedures that will remove wrinkles and tone your skin. In these, light or radio frequency sources destroy the outer layer of skin (the epidermis) and heat the underlying layer (the dermis), stimulating new collagen growth. The skin then heals and comes back younger-looking and tighter than before.Laser treatment is often “ablative,” which means that it causes wounds. The laser will either remove skin precisely, layer by layer, or destroy the top layers altogether. Ablative laser treatment may take several months of healing and carry the risk of scars. However, it can also reduce the likelihood of changes in skin pigmentation.  There are also “non-ablative” skin treatments that use light, but not normal lasers. These include intense pulsed light (IPL), infrared lasers, and phototherapy. Non-ablative procedures take less time to heal and have fewer risks. However, they also offer subtler results.IPL can target pigment on your skin to remove blemishes or discoloration, for example. Infrared and other non-ablative lasers can also resurface the skin, promoting new and healthier skin to grow. Keep in mind that you may need to repeat non-ablative procedures more often than ablative ones.  Still another option is radio frequency skin tightening. This procedure uses electromagnetic wave frequencies to heat your skin, stimulating new tissue and collagen growth and reducing the appearance of wrinkles. Ideally, it will tone your skin.Some treatments use a mix of radio frequency and light source energies, like Syneron. This is a non-invasive therapy that can improve fine lines but also blemishes, redness, and the appearance of small veins.  Botox is made from a form of the botulinum toxin and is an injectable, FDA approved filler for wrinkles and facial lines. It can also treat crows feet, forehead creases, wrinkling of the chest, and sagging bands of skin on the neck for a smoother, younger look.Consult with a dermatologist or cosmetic surgeon about whether you are a candidate for Botox injections. It is usually safe for men and women aged 18 to 70 years old. Botox works fast. You should notice results within 5 to 7 days after the injection, which will last several months. Botox is also minimally invasive. Be aware of side effects, though. Some patients report headaches, temporary numbness at the injection site, and nausea. Also, you may have less range of expression because Botox works by stopping muscles from contracting.  Both of these treatments involve “planing” and removing top layers of skin with a rotating brush, letting the underlying layer grow up in its place and resulting in smoother, tighter skin. Like ablative and non-ablative laser treatments, abrasions can be more or less aggressive.Talk to your dermatologist about dermabrasion. This procedure is more aggressive and will yield better results. However, you should expect to have redness and maybe scabbing that can last for several weeks. Pinkness can linger for a few months. Microdermabrasion only targets the very top layer of skin. You won’t see as much irritation, but you’ll also have to repeat the procedure several times to see results – as many as 16 times. The benefits are more modest and temporary.  During a chemical peel, a doctor will apply a mild acid to your skin to remove the top layers. This burning should remove scars and blemishes but also wrinkles, and will rejuvenate the skin. The peel stimulates new skin cells to grow, tightening the skin and making it look fresher.You can get chemical peels on certain areas of your face, forehead, hands, and chest. You may also need a series of peels. Expect to need about 5 to 7 days to heal from the peel. You may notice redness and irritation, as if your skin is sunburned.

 To make the job of tilling easier and more effective, it’s important to remove any grass or plants that are already growing in the soil you want to till. The purpose of tilling is to prepare the soil for new plants, so you start by removing the old growth.Use a shovel to dig into the ground around the roots of existing plants or weeds. Start a few inches (several centimeters) away from the plant and dig in at a 45-degree angle toward the center of the roots. Sever the roots with the shovel and pull the plants out by hand. Wear gardening gloves to do this. To remove sod, you can use a shovel to dig out small patches at a time, use an herbicide to kill the lawn, use a sod cutter, or kill the lawn by depriving it of light.  Rocks, large stones, tree roots, and other obstructions make it difficult to till land. Large rocks especially get in the way of the tiller, so it’s best to move them before you till. With a wheelbarrow, walk up and down the land you want to till. Look out for rocks, roots, and other items that aren't soil. Place anything you find into the wheelbarrow.   These objects are also obstructions for seedlings that are trying to grow, so your plants will have a better chance if the land is clear.  Different plants need certain soil conditions to thrive, and if your soil doesn’t meet those needs, then your plants may die. Two qualities you should evaluate for are soil type and pH. You can test pH with a test kit that you can buy at garden stores, home and hardware stores, and online. To determine the soil type:Take a hose and soak a small section of the soil in your garden. Grab a small handful of soil and squeeze it into a ball. Place the ball somewhere well-ventilated but protected from rain. Let the ball dry out for 24 hours. When dry, pick up the ball of soil. A tight ball indicates clay. A ball that crumbles or loses its shape is mostly sand. A crumbly ball that loosely holds its shape is loam, which is ideal.  In order to make the conditions more favorable for your plants, you can amend the soil with certain organic matters to make it more suitable for growing. For instance, you can add specific soils to create loam, and can add different things to adjust the pH.   For a garden with a high pH and acidic soil, sprinkle lime or wood ash over the soil before tilling to balance the pH.For a garden with a low pH and alkaline soil, sprinkle sawdust, peat moss, or compost. For a garden with sandy or clay-like soil, add 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) of aged compost, manure, peat moss, or shredded leaves.  

remove existing sod, plants, and weeds.  remove obstructions.  test and evaluate the soil.  amend the soil. 

 See if your friend has a stack of board games in their house that you can pick from. Even though they may seem retro, board games are surprisingly fun, no matter what your age! They also are a great way to give you both something to focus on so that you aren’t at a loss for what to do or talk about.Remember to compromise and pick a game that you’ll both like, and try not to be overly competitive once you start playing. If your friend doesn’t have any board games, see if they have a deck of cards so you can play card games.; , If your friend has a video game console like an Xbox or a Wii, play video games together! Try to pick games where to both of you can play at the same time, either on a team or against each other. Also pick a game where you are evenly matched.If you’ve never played video games before, your friend’s house can be a perfect introduction! Have your friend teach you how to play the game and start at the easiest level.  Kick around a soccer ball or shoot hoops with your friend if they have backyard. You can also just throw a baseball or Frisbee to have a fun activity to do that lets you enjoy the outdoors. You can even include your friend’s siblings in a game or invite other friends over to play.You don’t have to be good at sports to casually play. Be as competitive or casual as you feel like.  If you are having a sleepover at your friends house, play a game like Truth or Dare or Never Have I Ever. These games are a lot of fun, especially if a bunch of your friends are at your friend’s house.  If you’re looking for something to do on a rainy day or at night, watch a movie or even have a movie marathon. Pick out a movie that both you and your friend haven’t seen and will enjoy. Make a bag of popcorn, sit down on the couch, and enjoy the movie!Try to pick a movie that is fun and upbeat rather than slow or serious.  Your friend may have fun things at their house that you don’t have at your own, like a swimming pool or a trampoline. If the weather is warm, spend time jumping, swimming, or doing whatever activities you’re able to do at their house that you can’t do at your own.  If your friend lives in a safe and quiet neighborhood, walk or bike around for a change of scenery. Remember to stick by your friend and not to wander too far.

 For all intents and purposes, a “dipped” car (that is, a car coated in Plasti Dip) can be washed in exactly the same way as a traditionally painted vehicle. For the most thorough cleaning, hand washing the car with automotive soap (or even dish soap), clean water, a hose, and lint-free cloths for washing and drying is probably your best bet.Should you so choose, you can purchase soaps and cloths marketed specifically for dipped cars.Since Plasti Dip provides a protective coating against UV rays, salt, etc., applying waxes or similar finishes/protectants after washing is unnecessary.; , Because of Plasti Dip's composition, solvent-based cleaners could cause bubbling, peeling, or other damage to the applied product. Basically, just stick to common soap-based cleaners.Exercise caution when adding fuel to your car, as spilled or dripped gasoline could harm your Plasti Dip finish. You can order special drip guards if desired., Because Plasti Dip can be peeled off by hand with relative ease, some people are hesitant to use pressure sprayers to wash their dipped cars. However, if the Plasti Dip has been properly applied, allowed to cure for a few weeks, and is not peeling along edges or other spots, a common water sprayer of up to 1800 psi can be used.This means you can use one of the self-wash bays at your local car wash without incident. If you want to exercise added caution, use only the level of water pressure needed to get the job done.  The various scrubbers, sprays, buffers, and so on should not pose a problem., While some enthusiasts dip their entire cars, others stick to applying Plasti Dip to their hubcaps and wheels. Typical soap-based cleaning methods will work fine in keeping dipped wheels clean.However, newer spray-on, no-scrub, rinse-off cleaners developed for wheels (whether dipped or not) have come on the market as well. 

hand wash your car normally.  avoid thinners, solvents, and gasoline.  use a pressure sprayer up to 1800 psi.  go through an automatic car wash. once again, if the plasti dip has been properly applied, has had time to cure, and isn’t peeling, a trip through the average automatic car wash will have no negative impact on it.  wash brake dust and grime off your wheels. 

 A good collar can help your cat be safer outdoors, stay away from accidents, and make them easier to find if they get lost. Make sure their collar breaks away so they can’t choke themselves. Collars can get caught on something, so make sure the collar will not strangle the cat. Have a bell on the collar. This will help you keep track of the cat and know where they are at all times. Keep your contact information on the cat’s collar. Have your phone number on the cat’s collar so if it runs away, someone will be able to call you.

 8-ball is a game played with a cue ball and 15 "object balls," numbered 1 through 15. One player must pocket balls of the group numbered 1 through 7 (solid colors), while the other player has 9 through 15 (stripes). To win, you must be the player to pocket either group first, and then legally pocket the 8-ball., Look for a small dot or triangle in the lateral center of the felt, about a quarter of the way down the length of the table. This is where you will place the cue ball to begin the game. The line that runs through this point is called the "head string.", Find the triangular pool rack and place the 1-15 balls inside. Arrange the rack at the opposite end of the table from the head spot, with one corner of the triangle facing the break. Make sure that the rack is laterally centered along the foot string. Then, when you are ready to play, remove the racking frame so that only the balls remain.   Place the point of the triangle three-quarters down the length of the table, at the "foot spot": the dot on the tabletop that corresponds to the head spot. If the "head string" marks the 1/4 point from the head of the table to the foot, then the "foot string" is an imaginary line that marks the distance 3/4 of the way from the head to the foot. The "food spot" is located at the exact midpoint of the foot string line.Set the 8-ball in the center of the triangle. Put the 1-ball at the point of the triangle, facing the break. Place a stripe ball in one back corner of the rack, and a solid ball in the other corner.  Pool is rich with unique terminology that can be difficult for new players to understand. Reference the terms as you learn to play. If you aren't sure what something means, ask a veteran pool player to clarify.   Object balls: The striped and solid balls numbered 1-15. Every pool ball but the cue ball. The "object balls" are the balls that you are trying to knock into the pockets. Pocket: The baskets along the rim of the pool table. There are six pockets: one in each corner, and one at the midpoint of each long side. "Pocketing" is the act of knocking one or more numbered "object" balls into a pocket. Rail: The bank along the side of the pool tabletop. Scratch: When a player accidentally knocks the cue ball into a pocket. If you scratch, remove one of your sunk balls from a pocket and place it back in the center of the table. Your opponent now has the chance to shoot from his or her chosen spot at the top of the table. Open table: The table is "open" when the choice of groups (stripes or solids) has not yet been determined. When the table is open, it is legal to hit a solid first in order to make a stripe or solid. Foul penalty: Opposing player gets the cue ball in hand. This means that the player can place the cue ball anywhere on the table to take his or her next shot.  One player lines up the cue ball behind the head string and aims at the rack. Knock the cue ball into the triangle of balls with force and precision. To execute a legal break shot, the breaker must either pocket a ball, or drive at least four numbered balls to the rail. When the breaker fails to execute a proper break, it is a foul., If the breaking player scratches on his or her shot, then the game has only partially begun. In the case of a foul, the incoming player has two options: accept the table as is and take the next shot, or re-rack the balls for a redo of the opening break. The incoming player gets to choose whether to personally break or to allow the original breaker to try again.If a player scratches on a legal break shot:  All balls pocketed remain pocketed. The shot is a foul, meaning that it is now the other player's turn to shoot. The table is open, meaning that the first player to sink a ball without scratching chooses that ball type (stripes or solids) as his or her objective for the game.   If a player jumps a numbered ball off the table on the break shot, it is a foul. The incoming player has two options:  Accept the table in position. Take the next shot and continue the game. Take the cue ball in hand behind the head string. Shoot or break again, as necessary.   If the 8-ball is pocketed on the break, then the breaker may ask for a re-rack, or have the 8-ball spotted and continue shooting. If the breaker scratches while pocketing the 8-ball on the break, the incoming player has the option of a re-rack or having the 8-ball spotted and begin shooting with ball in hand behind the head string.  Before groups are chosen, the table is "open." The first player to sink a numbered ball effectively chooses to aim for that group of balls throughout the rest of the game. If you are the breaking player, for instance, and you sink the striped 13-ball, then you are "stripes." Look around for other striped balls that are easy to strike. Your goal is to pocket all of the striped balls (and then the 8-ball) before your opponent pockets all of the solid balls and the 8-ball.Make it clear who is who. If you make a stripe, call out, "I'm stripes!" If you make a solid, call out, "I'm solids!" If you are the first player to pocket a numbered ball, but you sink both a stripe and a solid at the same time: you have your pick between the two groups. Choose the group that looks the most immediately advantageous.  If you are shooting on "stripes," and you make the striped 12 ball, then it is still your turn. Try to pocket another striped ball. If you successfully pocket another striped ball on your next shot, then you can shoot again. As soon as you scratch or miss the pocket, however, it immediately becomes your opponent's turn.   There is no rule against combination shots, in which you sink two numbered balls from your group with one shot. However, the 8-ball can not be used as a first ball in the combination unless it is the shooter’s only remaining legal object ball on the table. Otherwise, it is a foul.  If you are shooting "stripes," then try to make all of the balls numbered 1-7 so that you can pocket the 8-ball. If you are shooting "solids," then make all of the balls numbered 9-15. If you make your opponent's ball, then your turn ends in a scratch.  In many official pool games, players must call each shot they take in order for that shot to be legal. This means: before each shot, announce which ball you are going to knock into which pocket. You might say, "4-ball, corner pocket," and indicate with your pool cue to make it clear which pocket you mean.If you are playing a casual game of pool with friends, then there is no need to call your shots.  You can only legally shoot at the 8-ball once you have made all of the other numbered balls in your group (stripes or solids). Make sure to call your pocket! Look over the table and decide which pocket will be the easiest place to sink the 8-ball. Then, announce where you are going to pocket the 8-ball before you shoot. If you are the first to legally pocket the 8-ball, then you win the game!For instance: say, "8-ball, corner pocket," and indicate which corner pocket you mean. If you call your shot, but you do not make the 8-ball into a pocket: it is now your opponent's turn to shoot. You have neither won nor lost unless you make the 8-ball or scratch while trying to make the 8-ball.  A game of 8-ball pool ends when a player legally sinks the 8-ball after pocketing all of the numbered balls in his or her group. However, a player can also lose the game by committing certain infractions.   A player loses when he or she: pockets the 8-ball at any point after the break; pockets the 8-ball on the same stroke as the last of his/her group of balls; jumps the 8-ball off the table at any time after the break; pockets the 8-ball in a pocket other than the one he/she has called; or pockets the 8-ball when it is not the legal "object ball."  

understand the basics.  find the head spot.  rack the balls.  learn the lingo.  break the rack.  know what to do in case of a scratch or foul.  choose groups.  keep shooting until you fail to pocket a ball.  pocket all of the balls in your group.  call your shots.  pocket the 8-ball.  finish the game. 

 Sometimes insecurities come from within, but they are often brought on by other people. Take some time to reflect on your current relationships. Is there someone who is constantly bringing you down?For instance, think about your relationship with your parents. Do you feel insecure because they constantly put you down? Or maybe your issues stem from work. Do you have a coworker who refuses to recognize your contributions to the team?  , If you find that there are negative people in your life, look for ways to limit your contact with them. If you are around positive people, you are more likely to feel secure. If your brother is part of the problem, try to limit contact with him and focus on the family members who are supportive. You can tell your Mom, “I’m sorry I can’t make the family picnic next Saturday. But I’d love to spend some one on one time with you. Can I take you to dinner next week?”  , Relationships that are positive will make you feel good about yourself. In order to strengthen your relationships, communicate your needs to others. These can be emotional or logistical needs.For example, you might say to your sister, "I need you to support me in my efforts to get in shape. Can you be a positive workout buddy for me?" Maybe it makes you feel bad when your husband is always late for date night. Try saying, "Sam, can you try to be on time for dinner Thursday? I want to feel like date night is a priority for you."  , It can be really helpful to create a barrier between yourself and the people or situations that make you feel insecure. Defining boundaries is a great way to make sure you have the emotional space that you need. Make a list of lines that you would like to draw.For example, if your dad causes you some anxiety you could set this boundary: "Instead of meeting Dad for dinner, I will meet him for a brief coffee break. That way, I can set a clear time limit." Maybe you are insecure about your dancing skills. Make a deal with yourself: attend your friend's wedding, but come up with a gracious way to decline invitations to hit the dance floor.  

evaluate your current relationships.  surround yourself with positive people.  make your needs clear.  set boundaries.

 Scrunch up your forehead, eyes, and mouth to find where wrinkles naturally form on the skin. Use a brown eyeliner or eyeshadow to lightly trace the lines of those wrinkle spots, then smudge the lines with your finger or a brush. Add bags under the eyes and any other aging spots you want.You can even add highlighter or eyeshadow in a lighter shade than your skin to the areas on either side of your “wrinkles” to make them look more three-dimensional. Try another method for wrinkles using non-toxic white glue, which you apply in a thin layer to your face. Apply it while your skin is stretched out by puffing up your cheeks or stretching it with your fingers, then when your skin relaxes to its normal state the glue will create wrinkles.Do the makeup or glue treatment to your hands or any other exposed skin as well. You can add blue or green makeup to hands and forearms to simulate prominent or varicose veins. Finish with touches like bright lipstick or drawn-on eyebrows.  Put on a white or gray wig, or use temporary dye or baby powder to color your own hair for the look.   Tie hair back in a simple, low bun. Or try putting hair curlers in and leaving them there. If you use baby powder to make your hair gray, try spraying over it with hairspray to help it stick and stay put., Look for large, clear-rimmed glasses with thick lenses in an outdated style. Find a chain or beaded glasses holder to wear them around your neck when they aren’t on your face.   If the glasses have prescription lenses that you can’t see out of, just pop out the lenses before wearing them.  Carry around a cane or walker with you to use for support when getting around.   This prop can help remind you to act like an old woman too, by staying stooped or bent over and relying on the cane or walker for balance.  Choose large, colorful, and over-the-top jewelry for a classic granny look. Put on big pearls, flashy earrings, or several metal or charm bracelets. Stick to gold metal for everything.Alternatively, try a few subtler sentimental pieces, like a tarnished wedding ring or a locket with pictures that would represent children or grandchildren. A sparkly brooch or pin is also a good addition, to either fasten a scarf or simply pin to the front of a sweater or dress.  For a special touch, fake a hearing aid by fashioning a piece of wax to look like the ear piece. Or use other earplugs or headphones in a light color to look like a hearing device.   The bonus of putting something in your ears to look like a hearing aid is that you truly won’t hear well when others are talking to you, making for an authentic demeanor.  Carry a large, unstructured bag or tote and fill it with some of the following convincing items:   Prescription or vitamin bottles An extra sweater Fruit and other snacks Denture case and cleaner Lipstick or other makeup Crossword puzzles or other word games  

create wrinkles with makeup.  achieve gray or white hair.  don large glasses.  use a cane or walker.  wear costume jewelry.  make a fake hearing aid.  keep other convincing items in your purse. 

 Exercise helps to produce endorphins, your brain's "happy chemicals," and will fight negative feelings or depression that may come with complicated grief.; , This can help you to know you are not alone in what you are feeling.  This is very important when you have CGD. Talking to a therapist does not mean you are weak and crazy, however, it can help you work through how you are feeling and address any core issues that are worsening how you feel. , This is why exposure therapy will help, because it will help you very slowly face your fears.  Sometimes people with CGD feel that life is not worth living anymore. If you feel this way or have suicidal thoughts, talk to a trusted friend, family member, mentor, pastor, or other responsible, trustworthy adult. You could also ask for help from an organization, such as the crisis textline (text to 741-741) or a suicide hotline.. If it's an emergency, call the Emergency Services.  It is okay to remember your loved one; you don't have to forget your loved one to "move on." However, if you are preoccupied continually with thoughts of your loved one, it can be unhealthy. It is important to find ways to remember them, such as making a scrapbook, planting a tree in their honor, or visiting their graveside, while still finding ways to live in the moment.   You may want to find new ways to socialize, get involved with community service, keep a journal of the (even small) good things that have happened, etc. You may want to have a professional assist you in doing these things.  

exercise on a regular basis.  attend a support group for those with complicated grief.  find a therapist.  ask your therapist to use cognitive behavioral therapy, meaning therapy, or exposure therapy.  ,  work on not avoiding reminders of the loss that bring anxiety and distress.  seek help immediately if you are suicidal.  find ways of remembering your loved one while still living in the present. 

 The position of a horse's ears says a lot about his mood.If his ears are flicking back and forth, your horse is probably frightened or overly stimulated. He is flicking his ears around to pinpoint the source of his anxiety. If his ears are perked forward, he is alert and interested in his surroundings. If his ears are pinned back tightly, he is angry or feeling aggressive and may be preparing to lash out with a kick or bite. If his ears are turned outward to the sides, he is relaxed and not paying attention to his surroundings. Be careful not to startle him by approaching or reaching out toward him suddenly.; , When a horse suddenly raises his head when being ridden, he is examining something far away and is no longer paying attention to you. He may be preparing to bolt or shy away from something.If your horse raises his head high while rounding his back, swishing his tail, or pinning his ears back, he may be in pain. Stop and check his legs and around his tack to be sure nothing is hurting him.  When your horse curls his upper lip while breathing in and out, he is examining a scent in the air. This may be a sign that something in the immediate environment is causing him stress., Your horse may be simply trying to get rid of a pesky fly, but it might be something more serious.Pawing at the ground with a raised leg usually indicates boredom or restlessness. Excessive stomping may mean your horse is annoyed with you for some reason. If you don't resolve the situation, your horse may move on to more extreme behavior next.  Horses communicate using body language, and the tail is a good indicator of mood. If your horse is slowly flipping his tail from side to side, he is probably just trying to swat a fly. But quick tail flips, or a clamped-down tail, indicate stress.A horse clamps its tail down by tucking it lower into its hindquarters. If your horse is pressing his tail down against his body, this is a sign that he is nervous or frightened. If your horse is jerking his tail rapidly up and down or side to side, he is probably irritated or angry and may be about to buck or kick.  

pay attention to his ears.  examine his head carriage.  watch his muzzle.  notice when he stomps or paws at the ground.  watch his tail. 

  When a bond is sold at face value, or issued at par, the selling price equals the principal of the bond.  Also, the yield, or the return, on the bond equals the interest rate.  To calculate the annual interest, you need to know the coupon rate and the price of the bond.For example, Company QRS issues 5-year, $500,000, 10 percent bonds, with interest paid semi-annually.  The market interest rate is 10 percent, so the bond is issued at par.   Interest is paid semi-annually, so the coupon rate per period is 5 percent (10 percent / 2) and the market interest rate per period is 5 percent (10 percent / 2).     The number of periods is 10 (2 periods per year * 5 years).   Multiply the face value of the bond by the coupon rate per period.  This tells you the interest payment the investors receive each period.   Using the above example, the face value of the bond is $500,000 and the coupon rate per period is 5 percent.   $500,000∗.05=$25,000{\displaystyle \$500,000*.05=\$25,000}   The interest payment to investors each period is $25,000   ,  Because you issued the bond at par, the journal entries are straightforward.  You don’t need to record any amortization of discounts or premiums.  For each period, record a debit of $25,000 to Interest Expense.  Also, record a credit of $25,000 to Cash. 

gather the information.  calculate the interest payment for each period.  record the total interest expense. 

 If you have tried exercise and dietary changes to no avail, or if you have a medical issue that is causing your gynecomastia, you may consider breast reduction surgery. You should set up a consultation with a plastic surgeon about male breast reduction surgery to ensure it is right for your condition.You can ask your GP for a referral to a plastic surgeon who specializes in breast reduction surgery for men. You may want to set up consultations with several surgeons to find one that is right for you. Though breast reduction surgery is an effective way to reduce your breasts, you will need to also maintain a healthy weight, balance your hormonal levels, and avoid certain drugs to reduce the chances of developing gynecomastia again.  Before you commit to breast reduction surgery, you should sit down with the surgeon and have her outline the procedure from start to finish.You will be put under general anaesthetic during the procedure, which should take around 90 minutes. Fatty tissue will be removed through an incision around your nipple. The surgeon may also make cuts down your chest to move excess tissue and then reposition your nipples. You will need to recover overnight in the hospital and allow yourself a few days off to rest. You will also need to avoid any strenuous activity up to six weeks after the operation. You will have to wear an elastic garment after the operation to assist with healing and recovery.  Though breast reduction surgery is often very effective, the surgery can leave red and lumpy scars in the area. They may appear for several months and then fade gradually over time.You are also at risk of losing sensation in your nipples and having uneven nipples as a result of the surgery.  

talk to your doctor about your surgical options.  discuss the procedure with the surgeon.  be aware of the risks associated with the procedure.

 Crazy glue can be tricky to get out of the tight, interwoven fibers of fabric or clothing. For most fabrics, acetone is your best bet. Put a drop or two of acetone on the bristles of an old toothbrush. Starting from the outside and working your way to the inside of the fabric, gently rub the glued area with the toothbrush to remove the glue. It isn't always possible to remove 100% of the glue from the fabric this way, but it should dissolve most of it.   Never use acetone on fabrics made from modacrylic, acetate, triacetate, or natural hair fibers like silk, wool and fur. Acetone can dissolve or damage these materials, causing permanent damage to the fabric.If you're not sure whether acetone is safe for your fabric, dab a tiny bit on an inconspicuous part of the fabric and wait five minutes to see if any damage occurs.  If you're dealing with a fabric that acetone can't be used on safely, use ordinary laundry detergent to help loosen the glue. Before washing, gently rub your normal detergent into the spot with dried glue with an old toothbrush or a rag, taking care not to damage the fabric with rough scrubbing. Toss the garment into the washing machine and set the water to the hottest setting allowed on the garment's care label. Check the fabric after washing — you may need to repeat several times to get the glue out.   You don't need to launder your glue-damaged fabric by itself. To use efficient use of water and electricity, launder it with a load of similar fabrics. The glue will not affect the other items in the wash.  Crazy glue can be notoriously difficult to get out of fabric (especially if you don't want to ruin the fabric while removing the glue.) If you have a glue stain on an especially valuable piece of fabric or you haven't been able to get it out with other methods, consider enlisting the help of a professional. Commercial dry cleaners will usually be able to get glue stains out, while larger items like rugs and pieces of furniture can be cleaned by home cleaning specialists.  

gently scrub with acetone and a toothbrush.  pre-treat and launder delicate fabrics.  when all else fails, see a professional. 

 Even if you've worked at a car wash business, you'll need to be up to date on all the latest trends and technologies to have a good understanding of the industry. Visit other car washes and figure out the type of car wash you would like to open (e.g. self-service, automatic, waterless, full detailing, etc.)For example, people use car washes more when the economy is doing well and when motor vehicle sales are up. When people have more money to spend, they are more willing to pay for a car wash. Knowing the car sales statistics in your area could help you predict success for your business. Talk to car wash owners, car wash suppliers, and car wash equipment manufacturers. You want to understand the car wash business from all sides so you know what you are getting into.The International Carwash Association is a good resource to learn about the industry and the current trends.Read Internet trend reports and business periodicals. Find out what the demographics are in your area and read up on how car wash businesses are doing in areas with similar demographics. Read business publications to find out what the newest materials and equipment are. The car wash industry is developing more energy efficient and environmentally friendly materials, so it's important to stay abreast of new developments.; , In order for your business to be competitive, you need to thoroughly research the other car washes in your area. If you have already chosen a location for your car wash, scope out all the competition within a 5 mile radius.What services do they offer? What are their prices? How do they market their business? How often are customers using the services?   Take notes as you investigate the car washes. You can go back and review them as you make plans for your car wash. Also pay attention to the other businesses around the car washes. If a car wash has a high volume of customers, what are some of the factors that are contributing to this? Is it located in a busy shopping center or right off the highway?  , A business plan will help you get financing to start your car wash and think through the details of your business. Make your plan as detailed as possible. The business plan should include an introduction (3-5 pages), market analysis (9-22 pages), company description (1-2 pages), organization and management (3-5 pages), marketing and sales strategies (4-6 pages), product/service (4-10 pages), equity investment and funding request (2-4 pages), financial information (12-25 pages).The introduction should include your Executive Summary, table of contents, and a cover page. Your market analysis demonstrates your knowledge of the car wash industry and the results of any market research and analysis that you have done. Who are your customers and what are their purchasing habits? What are the risks, strengths, and weaknesses involved with opening a car wash? What is your projected revenue based on the current market and future market trends?

The product or service section outlines exactly what you will be selling. How does your car wash business fill a void in the market? Why would people want to use your car wash as opposed to other car washes? The equity and funding section details exactly how much money you will need to start your business and what financial resources you already have to invest in the business. The financial information is the most important part of your business plan and should be reviewed by an accountant or financial planner. Include your personal financial information, any existing businesses you have, a list of debts, projected income for 5 years, and certification that your information was reviewed by a 3rd party financial adviser.  You will also need to have some cash of your own saved up to secure financing from others.The best way to do this is by presenting your business plan to your potential investor and show how your idea can be a viable business.   A bank loan requires a loan-to-value ratio of 75%. You will need to come up with 25% of the fair market value and the bank will fund the other 75%. It will be harder for you to secure bank financing if you have never owned a business before. An SBA loan will either be a 7a or a 504. If you get a 7a loan, the SBA will partner with a local investor. Your actual loan will be financed by the local lender. A 504 loan is actually financed by the SBA and has job creation criteria.The start up costs for a car wash range from $100,000 - $400,000., Having the right location can make or break your business. A successful location should be near a shopping center, in a high traffic, residential area, be easily and visible accessible from the road, allow for expansions and business growth, and have enough space for cars to line up.Your sign is visible to drivers for at least 40 seconds. Ideally, traffic should travel past at no more than 40 miles per hour (64 km/hr) so drivers have time to see your signage and make that split-second decision to have their cars washed. Choose a venue large enough to accommodate the bays, pump rooms, vacuum and drying areas, and the office. Check your city's zoning regulations to be sure you are allowed to open a car wash at your chosen location. If you need a special permit, obtain it before you buy or lease your venue. It is helpful to work with a real estate agent, city planner, lawyer, and/or an accountant to get the best deal on a location., You will definitely need a permit or a license to open your business. However, the requirements will differ depending on what state you live in. The SBA website maintains a list of business license offices to help you find the information.In addition to a business license, you will need a federal tax identification number and possibly a sales tax license, income tax withholding, and unemployment insurance tax.Ask your state business office about the insurance requirements for your car wash business. Once you get all of the necessary permits and licenses, keep track of your renewal dates and make a copy for your business records. You will also need to display your license in your car wash so that customers can see it.  The equipment you buy will depend on the type of car wash you have decided to open and the services you offer. Full service car wash, self-service car wash, and an automated car wash will all have different needs. You will typically need to buy a washing system (e.g. pressure washer, conveyor, self-service equipment, mobile wash systems), chemicals (e.g. cleaning solutions, wax, spot free rinses, protectants, presoaks, etc.), dryers, blowers, vacuums, brushes, towels, compressors, pumps, and a water system (e.g. boilers, water heater, water filtration, extractor, etc.), and billing system.   The International Carwash Association has a supplier guide to help you find reputable manufacturers.Look in trade magazines like Auto Laundry News and Modern Car Care to buy your chemicals. It is best to buy from big manufacturers.Popular equipment manufactures include Ryko, Hannah Industries, Belanger, Karcher, and WashTec. Make sure the distributor of your equipment is available to service your equipment when needed. Find out how they handle equipment servicing before you buy from them. Equipment typically lasts for 10 years.  Use a multifaceted approach to advertise your business that includes flyers, posters, and an online presence. The signage for your car wash should be colorful with clear messaging. Make sure that people can easily see it from the road. A popular way to get new customers is by distributing coupons or discounts for car washes. Also, develop relationships with other small businesses located near your car wash.   Social media is an important aspect of marketing these days. Set up a website and establish a presence on Twitter and Facebook. Make sure any of the paper items that you have include links to your website and social media accounts. Use your website to share information about taking care of your car and other relevant tips. Schedule a visit to your local radio station to discuss your new business. Consider starting a loyalty program. This will encourage repeat customers instead of people who use the coupon one time and never return.  A car wash business is very customer-focused. Your employees should be punctual, efficient, skilled, and have excellent communication skills. As you conduct interviews, pay attention to body language and communication skills to get an idea of how the person will interact with customers and coworkers.Always check the references of potential employees as well., Wait at least 30 days before you have the big event.You want to work out some of the kinks and feel comfortable with the car wash before you make a big deal. Think of a grand opening as a party and social event to generate publicity.Invite friends, neighboring businesses, your supplies, and the media Give away free car washes and promotional items.  Many car washes have combined other services and businesses with their car wash to increase revenue. Additional services will make your car wash more attractive to customers and help your car wash stand out from the crowd. A convenience store restaurant, barber shop, or even an enhanced waiting area (e.g. television, free coffee, comfortable place to sit, etc.) are possible additions. Ask yourself some questions before you invest in an add on serviceDo I have enough space or will I need additional space? How much will it cost? What will be the return on my investment? Will people buy this service?  , Express detailing services are services (e.g. wax, sealant, carpet shampoo) that can be done in 30 minutes or less and are done to maintain the appearance of your customer's vehicle. Because you already have the space and equipment, you can offer these services at a lower price than a free-standing detail shop. It is also more convenient for your customers to have their car washed and detailed at one location.It is important that you complete the detailing portion of your services is completed quickly. The speed and low cost of the service make it attractive to your customers. Make sure that you advertise your detailing services to your customers. Check the prices of similar services at a free-standing detail shop to help you determine your prices. Also, check the prices of other car washes in your area that offer these services so that you can be competitive.  Text marketing is a low cost, effective way to market your business to your customers. Your customers will redeem mobile coupons at a much higher rate than printed coupons. Even if a customer does not use a coupon, you are still building your brand and making your business known.Choose a keyword (e.g. water, wash, clean) and advertise by saying, "Text water to 12345 to get special discounts, specials, or coupons." You could also say "Text 12345 to get $3 off your next car wash." It only costs one or two pennies to send a text message. Text your customers once a month with a special.  Monthly and unlimited passes offer steady revenue even when customers are not actually coming in for a car wash. This is also a method you can use to build a steady customer base.Carefully price these passes. The price should be low enough so customers feel they are getting a good deal, and high enough for you to make a profit.Consider pricing your passes to cost of 2 or 3 times the price of a single wash. If you find that customers are not interested, you may need to adjust your price. You can offer different price points based on the type of car washes you offer. For example, a monthly pass for basic car washes would be less expensive than a monthly pass for premium car washes.  

research the car wash business.  investigate the competition in your area.  draw up a detailed business plan.  find the investment capital to open a car wash. you can finance your new car wash through bank financing, a small business association (sba) loan, or through private investors.  choose the location for your car wash business.  get the necessary permits and licenses.  buy equipment.  market your business.  hire employees.  open your car wash. have a soft opening of your car wash before you have a big grand opening.  add services.  offer express detailing services.  use text messages to contact customers.  offer monthly or unlimited passes. 

 You may find an obvious leak in a pipe or fixture on the floor above the damaged ceiling, but it may also be more difficult to pinpoint.If you don’t locate the source of the moisture prior to doing the repair, the problem will just keep coming back. Wear gloves, safety glasses and a dust mask while looking for and repairing the leak. Depending on how long the leak has gone unrepaired, there could be mold present. If there is an extensive amount of mold, hire a professional to remove it safely.; , If the stain is from a long since repaired leak and the damage is only aesthetic, you may be able to remove the stain with a little elbow grease.   Use a one to one water and bleach mixture to try to blot the stain away. Be sure to wear safety glasses and gloves when you apply it.If that doesn't work, wait until it dries completely and simply primer and paint the stain to match your ceiling. As long as the drywall is intact and the leak is repaired, you're done!, Depending on the extent of the damage, you may just need to cut out a bit of drywall or you may need to remove entire portions.If you only need to remove a small portion of the ceiling, use a keyhole saw or similar tool to remove the affected area. If the damage is extensive, you may need to use the claw end of a hammer or a crowbar to remove all of the damaged material. Ensure all stained drywall is removed and that any material remaining is dry and not sagging. Clean the area with household cleaner to ensure mildew and mold does not develop., Now that all of the damaged material is removed, it’s time to replace it with new drywall. Cut a portion of drywall that is the same approximate size as the area you cut out of the ceiling. If the hole you are patching is small, simply place the newly cut drywall into the hole, then use drywall joint compound to fill the gap and serve as glue to keep it in place. Use a putty knife to ensure it is flat and even. If the hole is larger, you may need help holding the replacement drywall in place while you use the joint compound to fill the gap and set. Allow the drywall joint compound to dry thoroughly, then use fine sand paper to ensure it is flat and even.  You will need to use a coat of primer on the drywall first, followed by a paint that matches the ceiling color.Many hardware stores can match the color for you if you provide them with a sample. Repainting the entire ceiling will ensure the color matches throughout. Adding a layer of shellac before you primer can help seal the repair. 

find the source of the moisture.  determine the extent of the damage.  remove any damaged drywall.  repair the hole in the drywall.  repaint the newly repaired area. 

 Once you suspect that someone is the victim of power of attorney abuse, then you should meet with a lawyer. To find referrals, first ask people that you know—friends, family members, or colleagues.If the agent committing the abuse is a family member, then don’t tip them off that you are looking for a lawyer. Accordingly, don’t ask them or any of their family members if they know an elder lawyer.; , You can also get referrals from your local or state bar association. A bar association is a professional group of attorneys. Most provide referrals. You should call or visit the website.   To find your nearest bar association, you can type your city or state and “bar association referral” into a search engine. The American Bar Association also has links to bar associations at its website., Another good source of referrals is another attorney.You might have used a lawyer when buying a house, writing a will, or adopting a child. Ask this lawyer if he or she can recommend an elder lawyer.   If the elder used a lawyer to draft the power of attorney, then you should certainly reach out to that person.  If you don’t have much money, then you can try to find legal help by visiting a local legal aid organization.Legal aid organizations are typically non-profits which provide free legal help to people in financial need.   You can find a legal aid organization by looking in your phonebook. Alternately, you could visit the Legal Services Corporation’s website at www.lsc.gov. Click on the link “Find Legal Help” at the top of the page and enter your address. You might also want to stop into a law school, if any is nearby. Law schools often run legal clinics where students provide free legal help under the supervision of a faculty member.  Once you have a list of lawyers, you should research them. Most lawyers now have websites you can visit. Look for the following:   Overall presentation. Check to see how professional the website looks. A sloppy website with grammatical errors or typos suggests that the lawyer might be careless. Experience. Each lawyer’s website should explain a little bit about the attorney’s experience. Look for someone who has handled elder abuse issues. Expertise. The website should also mention if the lawyer is a certified elder law specialist. Some states allow lawyers to become certified specialists in different fields. To qualify, the lawyer typically has to devote a certain percentage of their practice to elder law issues. They also must take continuing legal education classes in the field and pass a written exam., After you have a list of lawyers, you should schedule a consultation with at least three. During the consultation, you can ask the lawyers questions about their experience and also explain your current situation.   When you call the lawyer, ask how much the consultation will cost. Some lawyers offer free consultations. Others charge a small fee (typically less than $50). Consultations last 15-30 minutes, on average, so you should get organized., Take out whatever documents you think show abuse. You should put them in some kind of order for the lawyer to look at during the consultation. For example, you might gather:   The elder’s financial statements. If you have bank or credit card statements which show suspicious activity, you should show them to the lawyer. Any notes you have taken when meeting with the elder. You want the lawyer to know why you suspect financial abuse.  You will have an opportunity during the consultation to ask a few questions. You should draft them ahead of time and write them out on a notepad so that you don’t forget them. For example, you could ask the following:   If this abuse is taking place, how would you address it? Would you report it to the police? Sue the agent in court? What is the likely outcome of this case? What are your fees? Do you charge an hourly rate?Who else will work on the case? What are their billing rates?  , Arrive on time. Lawyers are usually busy, so you shouldn’t run late. Give yourself plenty of time to find parking.   If you are running late, then call the attorney’s office and tell the secretary. If you have to reschedule, then reschedule for a day and time when you won’t be busy. When you arrive at the office, tell the receptionist or secretary your name and that you have an appointment with the lawyer.  Once you have met with all of the lawyers, you should review the information they told you during the consultation. You need to make a decision about which lawyer to hire. Consider the following factors when choosing:How comfortable you feel with the attorney. You will be working closely with this lawyer, so you want someone you feel comfortable talking to and asking questions. The lawyer’s skill. You will want someone who you think has the experience to investigate the elder abuse and handle any lawsuit. The reasonableness of the fee. Although you shouldn’t necessarily hire the cheapest lawyer, you should feel comfortable paying the lawyer’s requested fee.  Once you have made a choice, call the attorney and state that you want to hire them. You should also contact any other lawyer you met with and let them know that you have chosen a different attorney. You don’t need to give a reason.   The lawyer you hire should send you an engagement letter. Read this document closely. It is the agreement between you and the lawyer. An engagement letter explains what the lawyer’s obligations will be, what your obligations as the client are, and the fee arrangement.If you need something in the letter clarified, then call the lawyer. Once you agree with everything in the letter, sign it and return it to the attorney. Keep a copy of the engagement letter for your own records.  No two power of attorneys are alike. You should find a copy of the elder’s power of attorney and read it so that you can understand what powers it gave the agent. The elder might have a copy or another family member might have a copy. Ask if you can read it.Some power of attorney documents grant the agent only limited powers. For example, an elder might give the agent the power to sell real estate. In this situation, the agent cannot sell the elder’s vehicles or mobile home. The agent also can’t make purchases on the elder’s credit cards or withdraw money from the elder’s bank accounts. Alternately, some power of attorney documents grant general powers.For example, an agent may have been granted power over all financial matters. In this situation, the agent manages all of the finances for the elder’s benefit.  Every agent must keep an elder informed. This is one of an agent’s most important duties.If the agent is not keeping the elder up to date about what is happening financially, then the agent is violating their duty to the elder.   Try to visit the elder when the agent isn’t around. For example, you could volunteer to take the elder out for an afternoon. Or you could stop in and visit when you know the agent will be out. If the agent has limited who may see the elder, then you should be suspicious. Often agents will try to keep the elder secluded out of fear that someone might discover the financial abuse. Also try to talk with other family members. If you aren’t around the elder often, you might want to meet with family members who see the elder more regularly. They might have seen shady financial dealings.  You should go through several months of bank statements to see how much money the agent is transferring in and out of the account. If you see large, unexplained transfers, then you should keep copies of the bank statements.   Also go through credit card statements and study what has been purchased. Pay attention to the stores where purchases have been made. Are these stores which sell products the elder would use? For example, if you see purchases at a lingerie store or at a sports equipment store, then you should be suspicious. Look at statements for retirement accounts. Has the pattern of disbursements changed? For example, the elder might have received $500 a month from a retirement account. However, if you see a sudden increase to $1,000 or so, then you might want to ask the agent why the change was made.  An agent cannot transfer an elder’s property into the agent’s name. The only exception is if the power of attorney document specifically states that the agent can.You should look to see if the agent has sold or transferred property.    Find the deed to the elder’s house. Look to see that it is still in the elder’s name. If it has been transferred to anyone else, including the agent, then make a copy of the deed. Look to see if any vehicles are gone from the property. Ask the agent where they are. If they were sold, then you should see the proceeds deposited into the elder’s checking or savings account.  

ask people who you know.  contact your state or local bar association.  ask another lawyer.  find legal aid organizations.  research the lawyers.  schedule consultations.  gather relevant documents.  draft a list of questions.  meet for a consultation.  pick the lawyer.  call the lawyer.  read the power of attorney document.  talk to the elder.  look at bank account statements.  check the title to property. 

 Ask the same or similar questions of all subjects involved to ensure that you get different perspectives on a similar subject or service.   When you ask a question that doesn't let someone answer with a "yes" or a "no" you usually get more information. What you are trying to do is get the person to tell you whatever it is that he or she knows and thinks --even though you don't always know just what that is going to be before you ask the question. Keep your questions open-ended. Request data and materials from subjects as applicable to add credibility to your findings and future presentations of your case study. Clients can provide statistics about usage of a new tool or product and participants can provide photos and quotes that show evidence of findings that may support the case.  Organize all of your data in the same place to ensure easy access to information and materials while writing the case study.   You can't include it all. So, you need to think about how to sort through it, take out the excess, and arrange it so that the situation at the case site will be understandable to your readers. Before you can do this, you have to put all the information together where you can see it and analyze what is going on.  As you go through your data, think about how you can put what you've found into a thesis-like statement. What patterns have your subjects brought to light?   This will allow you to concentrate on what material is the most important. You're bound to receive information from participants that should be included, but solely on the periphery. Organize your material to mirror this.  

conduct interviews.  collect and analyze all applicable data, including documents, archival records, observations and artifacts.  formulate the problem in one or two sentences. 

 Be careful not to damage the porch, deck, or support columns when removing existing lattice.   Cut the lattice into pieces with a reciprocating saw if you are having trouble removing it. This will make it easier.You can also use a small carpenters cat's paw, which will help pry off small nails. If the old lattice is stapled, find a screwdriver with a blade just wide enough to fit onto the staple. Gently pry it off.; , Do not install new lattice without making sure there are no animals living underneath your deck.   If you find animals, encourage them to leave by allowing as much light in as possible. Also, let your water hose run next to the deck. This will encourage the animals to leave because they like dark, dry, and quiet areas to nest in.Avoid using traps or poison as that may kill any non-target animals or kill an animal in an unreachable place. You may be able to find a volunteer group that will relocate wildlife. Call your local or state fish and game office or city animal control to learn about options in your area. If you can't find a volunteer, you may be able to hire a professional wildlife removal service.  You will screw the lattice to the frames, and then you will attach the frames to the house. Be sure to use rust-proof hardware and fasteners.  Measure the openings between the support columns or posts of the deck or porch. The completed frames should be 1/2 inch narrower than the overall width and 1 inch shorter than the height of the openings.If you install the lattice flush to the ground, the framing can buckle and snag leaves., Use a circular or jigsaw to cut 1-by-6 inch lumber to a length of 4 1/2-feet or to your required measured length.  Cut the center stiles the same length as the shorter edges of the frames using 1-by-4 inch lumber.  Lay the frame pieces face down and assemble them. Attach a 6-inch mending plate and a 3 1/2-inch flat corner brace to each corner joint of the frame. Attach the hardware approximately 1/4 inch from the edges of the frames using 3/4-inch flathead screws. Make sure you work on a flat, sturdy surface to put together the frames  , Use two 4-inch T-plates, making sure that the plate is centered on the support piece. Position the T-plates about ¼ inch from the edge of the frame. Use 3/4-inch screws to secure them. , Lay the frames face down. Attach a piece of lattice to each frame using 1-inch pan head screws driven through washers.Allow a 1/ 4-inch gap on all sides between the edge of the frame and lattice. This lets the lattice to expand and contract when the weather changes. This will prevent the lattice from buckling., The two pieces of lattice will form a seam on the center stile. Screw 1-inch (2.54 cm) pan head screws with washers to each of the lattice panels where they meet at the center stile. Make two rows of screws, drilling them at each point the lattices meet.  Screw the hinges to the lattice frames first. , Once it is tight, screw the hinges to the porch or deck using a drill with a screwdriver head.  If the lattice frame drags on the ground or doesn't close all the way, use a shovel or garden hoe to remove some of the dirt in front of and underneath the frame. If there is too much space beneath the lattice frame, add and compact more dirt. Distribute the dirt evenly so that the ground will be flat.  

remove any old lattice with a flat pry bar.  make sure nothing is living under your deck or porch.  gather the materials needed to make frames for the lattice.  calculate the dimensions of the lattice frames.  make the four perimeter pieces for the lattice frames.  cut a center stile for each frame.  assemble the frames.  attach a center stile to each frame.  cut the lattice panels to fit each frame using a sabre or circular saw.  secure the seam between two pieces of lattice.  attach the framed lattice panel to the porch or deck using 3 or 4-inch strap or t-hinges.  place each panel inside the openings under the deck or porch.  ,  use a pry bar to raise the lattice frame so it will be tight against the porch or deck.  open and shut the lattice frames to make sure they shut properly. 

 Read How to call Mayday from a marine vessel to learn how to do this.  This is standard – 7 short horn blasts followed by one long one.The captain or other crew members may also use the intercom system to speak to all other crew and passengers.  Be as prepared to exit the ship as time allows. If you have time to grab any additional survival items, do so. But only if doing so won't endanger your life or the lives of others.  If you have time, put on all your waterproof gear, such as headgear, jacket, and gloves.If there is an emergency survival suit available and time permits, put it on. Note that while survival suits increase your chances of surviving in cold water, they are unlikely to be provided on passenger ships. For crew who have access to such suits, they will usually be required to practice putting on this suit within 2 minutes. Attend to all infants, children, and pets after you've prepared yourself.  This may be the most important step of all. If you don't know how to get to safety, the captain or one of the crew members will tell you how. Ship's crews are highly trained in rescue operations on many ships and will have a better understanding than you about what needs to be done to ensure your safety. You should only attempt to escape on your own if there is no authority present to give proper directions. A well-run ship will have a "muster station" where everyone needs to gather in preparation for evacuation. If you received a safety drill in going to a muster station, try to comply with it.   If you can't hear or understand the directions (for example, it's not your language), keep one thing in mind - head up and off the ship. Heading to the center or inner levels of the boat is not wise but don't be surprised if people do this as a result of panic. If the captain assigns you with tasks, speak up if you don't feel you can comply. Otherwise, do your best to help out.  It may sound like an inevitable cliché, but the more you panic, the longer it will take to get to a lifeboat. Studies have shown that only about 15 percent of people manage not to panic, with a whopping 70 percent suffering from impaired reasoning and 15 percent becoming irrational.Thus, staying calm is important for dealing with other passengers as well as helping to keep your own mind focused to do whatever you can to survive. If others around you are panicking, try as best you can to calm them down, as their actions will only slow down and possibly endanger your evacuation. Unfortunately, panic on a cruise is something that can endanger everyone owing to the amount of people involved and this can lead people to push and shove one another, causing injuries before people have even left the ship.Be aware that the opposite spectrum of panic can kick in – that of being stunned and unable to respond at all.If you see someone frozen with fear, yell at them. This is what flight attendants are trained to do to get passengers to leave a burning plane, and can be adapted to a boat situation. Try to focus on keeping your breathing under control. If you're used to breathing for yoga, pilates, or any similar relaxation breathing techniques, use these to calm you, as well as resorting to breathing this way if you end up in the water trying to survive., Getting out fast is more important that getting out by going the shortest way which might even lead you to more danger. As the ship begins to tilt, grab whatever you can to help you remain upright and able to reach your destination, such as handrails, pipes, hooks, light fittings, etc.   Do not take the elevator. Just as you should avoid elevators when escaping a fire, the same applies here; all electrically driven items are suspect. The last place you'll want to be on a sinking ship is stranded in an elevator, so only use it as a last resort if the stairs are flooded. While still in the inner deck areas, watch for catapulting or floating objects coming your way. Large items hitting you can knock you unconscious or kill you.  Most of today's cruise liners run safety drills and procedures prior to departing on voyages so that passengers know where to go in the event of an emergency. If not, head to where it seems that the crew are assisting passengers to escape. Crew will usually be the last to abandon ship, as it is their duty to get everyone else off the ship to possible safety first.   Don't play the hero by staying back while crew is on board. Do what needs to be done to ensure that survival of yourself and your loved ones is not compromised. This isn't the movies.  The very best scenario is to enter a lifeboat without getting wet. The moment you're wet, you risk getting hypothermia or suffering from cold shock (see below). If lifeboats are already deployed, head for the best place to enter or jump into them, following instructions of crew if relevant.   If there are no lifeboats available, try to find a life preserver ring or similar flotation device and toss it into the water. Any flotation device is better than none, although your survival chances decrease dramatically once you're forced to spend time in the water. You may need to jump off the ship, or in some cases, simply step off an incline. If there is a lifeboat nearby, swim to it, wave your arms, and shout to attract attention. If jumping, always look first. There may be people, boats, fires, propellers, etc., in the water below that you could hit or be submerged in. The ideal scenario is getting straight into a lifeboat. If not, the next best scenario is to jump as close to a rescue boat as possible and make your way into it immediately.  Waiting alone in the open ocean without the comfort of a large ship will undoubtedly be frightening, but be patient. Help is on the way.   In a lifeboat, use rations sparingly. Use flares only when it is clear that doing so will result in a rescuer seeing you. Huddle together to keep warm. Arrange lookout watches. Collect rainwater and don't drink seawater or urine. Treat any injuries as best you can.Stay determined. Stories of survivors at sea are a testament that it is the most determined who survive harsh waiting conditions leading up to rescue. If you couldn't find a lifeboat, look for the next best things, such as a life raft, or bobbing objects from the ship (flotsam) that remain afloat.  If you don't end up in a lifeboat either straight away or fairly quickly, your survival odds worsen a great deal. The sea is cold and if it's rough, even the strongest swimmers will have a hard time defeating the cold and the sea swells. Inadequate amounts of lifeboats or lost lifeboats mean that there can be more people than space, causing more panic and even endangering the remaining lifeboats as people desperately cling to them or clamber on.   Being in cold water will cause hypothermia. Hypothermia will cause you to want to sleep. If you fall asleep or fall unconscious, you risk drowning. Cold shock is the kind of shock that comes from hitting cold water and being unable to control your breathing while your heart rate and blood pressure go up, immediately incapacitating you.Cold shock can cause you to take an involuntary breath, which will often cause you to take in water.While those who are used to entering cold water can tolerate this for initial few minutes required to regain your senses, many people are not able to do so and drown. This cold shock phenomenon occurs before hypothermia sets in. Shock may set in, causing everything to become surreal and to prevent you from doing your best to survive. If shock doesn't set in, mental distress is a highly likely possibility, with nothing but water everywhere, right to the horizon, and not knowing when rescue will arrive. Try to prevent this by focusing on surviving, using mind games, counting, thinking about other people's needs, etc. Your hands and fingers will become numb very quickly, making even doing up a lifejacket difficult, if not impossible. Even in good weather, heatstroke, sunburn, and dehydration soon become an issue. Try to cover yourself up as best you can and ration water supplies carefully. If you do survive, be ready for the reality that some of the people on the lifeboat with you may not. Seek counseling for post-traumatic stress disorder if needed.  

send out a mayday if you're in charge of the sinking ship.  listen for the evacuation signal.  put on your personal flotation device (pfd).  follow directions.  stay calm and don't panic.  focus on escaping via the quickest route, not the shortest route.  once you've made it on deck, head to your emergency station or the nearest lifeboat available.  find a lifeboat.  stay calm in the lifeboat, follow directions, and wait for rescue.  expect some harsh realities.

CHANGE IT. Maxi skirts, half tucked shirts, skinny jeans, heels, shorts, sweaters, and scarf all look good when you need to look taller. Or if you on the heavy side, try black clothes with little peep holes, deep V's, anything a-lined, and platforms. No curves at all? Pick soft poofy pieces with lower neck lines. Ruffled tops, tight dresses, shredded jeans, and wide belts add curves. , Make it only one. Maxi skirts, blazers, dresses, docs, tunics, graphic shirts, khaki's, leggings, dusters, and sweaters are all fall staples, but you could probably work all year round. , The best skirts will work year round.

 Foxglove seed is readily available in seed packets on most flower seed stands. If you decide to start foxglove from seed, you'll need to be ready to plant it in early summer. If you're planting seedlings, you may plant in spring or fall.If you're starting from seed, use 4-inch seed trays with seed compost. Lightly press the seeds into the compost. Do not cover the seeds with more compost once they are sown, since they require light to germinate.Plan to plant the seedlings when they are a few inches tall.; , Foxglove prefer full sun or light shade.Find a place that isn't too windy and gets plenty of sun for most of the day. They should be protected from wind as they are easily buffeted about and can change their growth shape if assaulted by wind too frequently.If your climate is very hot, semi-shade is acceptable.  Foxglove like soil that is deep, moist, and acidic. Look for a spot that drains well, rather than holding too much water. If you see puddles in an area after a heavy rain, it probably doesn't drain well enough to be a good home for foxglove.  Use a garden rake or hoe to loosen the soil and rake in compost to a depth of about a foot. This will make sure the soil is suitably rich and ready for the foxglove to take root.   You can use fertilizer instead of compost, but be sure to use a light application. Too much fertilizer will harm the foxglove., They should be twice as wide as the root balls of the seedlings, and deep enough so that you can fit the entire rootball underground.  Set the root balls into the holes and lightly pat soil around the bases of the stems. Water the area thoroughly.  This will help nourish the foxglove and so they produce big, healthy blossoms. Cover the compost with a 2-inch layer of mulch to prevent weeds from taking over.  This is especially important if there hasn't been much rainfall, or if you live in an area that gets very hot.  If you have a plant that grows several feet tall, you may want to stake it to keep it from breaking. Use a wooden stake and some twine to gently tie the plant upright. This is especially important if you live in a windy area.  The central stalk requires the most water and energy, so removing it will allow nutrients to flow to smaller stalks, making the plant look more even. Cut the spike at its base.  It's easy to harvest the seeds of foxglove so you can plant them the following spring. Allow the flowers to wither and remove seeds from the tall central stalk. Store them in a cool, dry place and sow them in the spring.   If you removed the central stalk to promote side shoots, you won't be able to harvest seeds.  

purchase seed or seedlings from a garden store.  find a good place to plant foxglove.  look for suitable soil.  prepare the planting site.  dig holes spaced 2 to 4 feet (0.6 to 1.2 m) apart.  plant the foxglove.  apply compost each spring.  water foxglove during the summer.  stake tall foxglove.  remove the central stalk to promote the growth of side shoots.  harvest the seeds. 

 A deep conditioner will hydrate your permed hair, decrease frizziness, and make the perm look a bit better., If you’re looking to try to restyle the perm by straightening it, it’s important to first deep condition your hair really well before applying any more heat to your hair. Do this the day before you plan to straighten your hair. You should also condition your hair every day to restore moisture and reclose the all important cuticle layer of your hair.Wet your hair and towel dry it. Then, apply the waving lotion (or perming solution) to the wet hair and comb through it using a wide tooth comb. Do this over a tub or sink. Have a friend assist you if your hair is too long or you may miss any spots. You want to be sure your hair is completely saturated with the waving lotion. Continue combing your hair with the waving lotion for 10 minutes. You should start to notice the curls have relaxed and the hair hangs straight. If this isn’t happening, continue combing your hair with waving lotion for another 5 minutes until the curls relax. Rinse the waving lotion from your hair using warm water for at least 3 minutes to ensure you get all the lotion out of your hair. Once rinsed, use a towel to gently blot water from your hair, but do not rub the hair with the towel as this will create more frizz. Apply the neutralizer to your hair and comb it through the exact same way you did with the waving lotion, for up to 5 minutes. Rinse the neutralizer from your hair with warm water for 5 minutes. Finish rinsing with cool water, as the cool water helps to close the cuticle layer. Apply deep conditioner to your hair to prevent tangles. Use a clean towel to gently blot away any excess water, avoid rubbing your hair to dry it. Allow your hair to finish drying naturally or use a blow dryer with a diffuser at the lowest heat setting. Use a vented brush to control the hair and keep it smooth.  Do not get your hair re permed until at least several weeks after the first perm, as you do not want to damage your hair any further.Your stylist may be able to come up with another, more practical solution: a new, shorter hair cut. A major hair cut could be the only want to really solve the bad perm, as it allows you to remove the damaged hair completely., Using this treatment should loosen the perm to make it more manageable to re style, but you may need to repeat the treatment for a few weeks to really see results if your perm is acting stubborn and will not relax after one treatment.Gather together your materials, including a bottle of canola oil, a roll of plastic wrap, a towel, a gentle shampoo, a deep conditioner, a blow dryer with a diffuser, and styling shears. Place your head over a garbage can, a sink or a tub, and apply enough canola oil to thoroughly soak your hair from root to tip. Wrap your head with the plastic wrap or with a plastic bag. Then, wrap the plastic with a towel so it will retain head and prevent any oil from dripping off your hair. Leave the oil in your hair for 1-2 hours. Then, rinse your hair completely in the shower. Use the gentle shampoo to loosen the oil from your hair. Make sure you also lather your hair with conditioner and let it sit for at least 2 minutes, then rinse and repeat until all the oil is gone. Follow this regime for at least a week.  Coconut oil is one of the only oils that will penetrate the hair shaft, as opposed to just coat it. So it will effectively moisturize, condition, and repair damaged hair from the inside out.Melt 1 cup of organic virgin coconut oil. You can use a microwave (but be sure to put the coconut oil in a microwave safe bowl) or you are melt the oil on a stovetop by placing the oil in a jar and then in a pot filled halfway with water. Heat the pot on the stovetop until the oil melts in the jar. Add ½ teaspoon of essential oils that are good for dry, damaged hair, like Bay, Cedarwood, Chamomile, Clary Sage, Eucalyptus, Frankincense, Lavender, Lemon, Myrrh, Rose, Sage, Sandalwood, and Tea Tree. Use your fingers to melt several tablespoons of the infused coconut oil and then apply it to your dry hair. Comb it through. Wrap your head in a towel or a shower cap. Leave the oil in for at least 1-2 hours. Wash the oil out with shampoo and conditioner.  Many bad perms are the result of improper application of the perm rod. If you have extremely straight or coarse hair, your hair may not wind around the rod properly. This can then lead to fishtails at the ends of your hair. But you can fix the fishtail with a little persistence and a pair of styling shears.When trimming the end of the fishtail, only make the cut on the straight part of the hair. You do not want the cut to interfere with the curl pattern at all. Cut your fishtailed ends three days after the perm to prevent any further damage to your hair.Minor trimming can be done at home on your own or your stylist could also trim the fishtailed ends for you.  

use a good deep conditioner.  apply waving lotion to straighten out the perm.  ask your stylist to re perm your hair at a later date or give you a new haircut.  apply a canola oil treatment.  make a coconut oil mask.  trim the ends of your permed hair or the fishtail. 

 If you have worms, you may feel an itching in your abdomen that is not normal. This itchiness occurs because the worms release toxins in your body that your immune system responds to like an allergic reaction., Like the itchiness you feel, another reaction that your immune system will produce is a rash. This is again caused by the toxic fluids that the worms leak into our system that causes a hypersensitive reaction in the form of a rash.   The rash will most likely show up as red bumps that might itch.  Some worms can create an obstruction (or blockage) in your intestines. A few worms will causes ulcers, which in turn can cause severe pain in your abdomen. Worms that can cause obstructions in the intestine includeRound worms. Tapeworms. Hookworms.  If you have a worm (or worms) in your body, you may experience sudden weight loss without trying to lose weight. This is because worms extract the nutrients from the food that you eat, which means that you don’t get any of the good nutrients that you normally get when you eat food.  These symptoms are most commonly associated with roundworms. This type of worm has a tendency to travel from the stomach, up into the chest area. When they move, they can cause you to gag because they are a foreign body moving through your system.  Some types of worms, particularly hookworms, actually hook themselves into the lining of your intestine, which can cause a wound to form. Whether or not the worm moves, the wound will continue to bleed. This blood can make its way through your intestine and into your stool.   The blood can show up as a reddish color in your stool, or your stools may look black, signifying older blood.  

monitor any itching in the abdomen that you feel.  look for any rashes on your body.  pay attention to any pain you feel in your abdomen.  monitor any sudden and unexplained weight loss.  watch out for gagging or coughing that you experience.  look for any blood in your stool.

 No matter how tired you are, make two or three days a week mandatory in the gym. When you go doesn't matter - just do it before you get home in the evening. You need to start with a commitment. And a first step.; , Five to ten minutes on the elliptical if you can.  Forget about three sets (unless you really are a professional athlete). One set of ten to twenty or so is enough. There does need to be enough weight to tire the muscle without straining. For most of us less really is more. If a workout is not as tedious, it'll be easier to do on a regular basis. The concept in fitness circles is called supersets - and they really are. If you want to progress faster, rotate among a few exercises for that extra super set.  DON'T rest between machines. Use machines rather than free weights, especially when getting started. They're designed to keep you in proper form. , Curls are not needed. Arms are worked indirectly by chest, back or shoulder exercises. The more slowly that you move the weight, the better. If you rush, inertia takes over and you're not working the muscle over its full range. Even slower on the negative.  Go fast enough to sweat. No reading is allowed (it slows you down). Once you've settled into a routine, intersperse with 1 or 2 minute intense segments (interval training), where you push your heart rate an extra 10 or 20 BPM. Cool down for a few minutes. Stretch at the end of your workout. If you're up for more cardio, go for it but build up slowly. , Eat more veggies and fruit and fewer dense foods, especially those that are high in fat. Skip the protein bars or drinks. Protein deficiency is rare in the US. Only professional athletes and some senior citizens regularly need supplemental protein.  Even if it's just a 10 minute walk (or two). Use the stairs instead of the elevator.  

walk in the door (the hardest part).  warm up.  do less.  limit yourself to six to nine machines and twenty to thirty minutes.  rotate among upper body, core (mid-section) and legs.  ,  work major muscle groups.  hop on the elliptical for 10 to 20 minutes and optionally switch to the treadmill for another 5 to 20.  reward yourself with a few minutes in the pool, steam room or sauna.  ,  while at home, it is important to eat a nutritionally sound diet.  on days you skip the gym, do something else. 

 Choose a silk or nylon cloth of your liking and prepare a space where you can perform the wrapping techniques.; , This is the simplest method; it is the hand-carried wrap. This method allows you to quickly and easily create a bag for carrying a large amount of food or other products. Tie two opposite corners together over the food or packages sitting in the middle. The cloth should already be covering the items.       Pull across the other two corners to meet together and tie.       Grab the bag in the middle to carry.  This is a variation of the first technique, known also as the shoulder carry-wrap. This technique allows you to make an ergonomic method of carrying a large amount of food. Place items in the middle of the cloth and tie two opposite corners across the middle.       Take one of the remaining corners and tie a side knot in it (like a candy wrapper twist).       Tie the other corner in a side knot.       Pick up the bag from the middle knot.       Sling it over your shoulder to carry the goods.  This translates as the melon carry-wrap. It demonstrates just how strong a thin piece of cloth can be. Place a 16 pound bowling ball (or your groceries) in the middle of the square cloth.       Bring up two adjacent corners and tie together in a large knot.       Tie the other two adjacent corners together.       Pick up one knot in each hand and feed one knot (A) through the hole formed by the other.       Pull up on knot (A) tightening the bag around the bowling ball. Just imagine doing that with an ordinary plastic grocery bag!        , This shows that Furoshiki is not only functional but also decorative. This is a bottle carry wrap. This method will make a great impression on your friends and family, especially when bringing wine as a gift, or to a party. Lay two bottles base to base diagonally across the middle of the square wrap. be sure to keep them about a fist's width apart.       Bring one side over both bottles to meet at the other side, forming a large triangle of the cloth.       Roll the bottles in the cloth over, like a sausage.       Roll completely until there is no wrap remaining width ways.       Lift the bottles up by picking up the two lengths at the cork end of each bottle.       Tie the two ends in a knot.       Carry.  There are many more methods of Furoshiki that can show you how to wrap just about anything. Search the internet for more ideas. Feel free to share your personal Furoshiki experiences on wikiHow.  

lay out your square cloth on the table or similar work surface.  try yotsu musubi.  try katakake fukuro.  try suika tsutsumi.  try bin tsutsumi.  keep wrapping. 

 Depending on your climate, poinsettias tend to due better outside than in, so grow them outside where they get partial shade in the afternoon. If it gets too hot and dry, their growth might slow.  You will never get that "store bought" look again, as they are literally tree sapping. If you want some "store bought" looking plants, take cuttings from your plants (don't worry you can still flower the parent plants too) from late April, up until you bring them inside to flower. You can use rooting hormone, but poinsettias seem to root well in just compost (such as compost made from yard waste like grass clippings).  Depending on when you want the poinsettia to be fully flowering and how you intend to care for them after flowering, determines on when you start flowering them. If you want them in full bloom by Thanksgiving, start on October 1st and by Halloween for Christmas. You can start earlier, but you need to maintain light timing to keep them flowering throughout the season.  Choose a spot which is lightproof, for the most part.  It's necessary to use "warm white" as opposed to regular grow lights because the plant needs the extra red light; this, plus the timing, will ensure flowering.   Make sure you have enough light too. One 26watt CFL (100watt equivalent) for two or more plants won't be enough. Use one 26 watt CFL per cutting about 1 and 1/2 feet above them to just 1 foot (0.3 m). Make sure you can adjust the height, as they will grow fast during flowering. HPS lights can be used too. Be careful with HPS lights though, as local law enforcement might think you are flowering another Mexican plant with the same light cycle! HPS light give off signatures they use to help track unlawful botanists.  Set the timing to suit. A good one is to use standard banking hours, 9am to 5pm. Do not disturb the plants when the lights are off. While 14 hours of darkness is said to be enough, 16 hours works every time (with warm white).  The first signs they have begun to flower is what you might call "rusting out". This is when the top leaves quite literally "rust out" as they think it's fall. Leave the plant under the light until it has fully flowered.   You may want to leave the plant in your makeshift nursery the whole season and bring it out for company and the day of the holiday you want to display it. Even the plants you buy this year would benefit and be a good plant to make cutting from next year, so put them in the nursery too.  This will keep it flowering long after the season is over. Take good care of it: keep the plant watered properly, keep it away from whiteflies, and give it plenty of light during its day cycle. Given this care, the plant can flower well past Mother's Day!   If the plant is still flowering for too long, put it under light with 24 hours of on time to get it to vegetate. You may find that some plants will still have flower buds on when you place them outside for the summer.  

grow outdoors when possible.  be realistic about the plant's appearance.  focus on the timing of the flowering.  put the plants in a dark room, closet or cabinet.  use warm white cfls or warm white fluorescent tubes.  set the timing.  check for flowering indicators.  avoid letting the plant have more than 10 hours of light a day. 

 If you have several sources of income, you won't suffer as much financially when you lose one of them. As long as you have some income, you have more time to come to replace what is lost without worrying about how to pay your bills. Some possible ways to diversify are:; , You might consider turning a hobby into a business.  You can also sell e-books or other information products on your blog or website.  If you have a master's degree you can get an adjunct professor position at a local college. Or you can teach online classes or in the community.  Sell your old stuff, books, toys, technology, anything that you basically do not use within a year. Use Craigslist to sell furniture and/or to buy things discounted. Learn to look for bargains and learn to negotiate too.  Unless you believe the government knows how to best spend your money, keep more of it for yourself legally. Learn which deductions your qualify for and make sure to research others you can qualify for legally. For example, open a Roth IRA if you meet the income contribution limits and participate in your employer tax deductible 401k plan. Learn the benefits of doing a blending of both types of accounts tax deferred and taxable.  When you get a raise automatically deposit/invest it in an index fund like Vanguard's S&P 500 (VTSAX).  

diversify your income.  start a part-time business that you can do on nights and weekends.  create a passive income stream by setting up blogs or websites that offer useful information and carry ads that pay you a small commission for every visitor who clicks on the ad.  teach.  create multiple steams of income.  reduce your taxable income.  save more than 40 percent of your income and consistently raise it each year. 

   Wrap a tape measure around your waist, directly above the belly button. This is known as your natural waist. Pull the tape measure taut, but do not squeeze your waist. Make a note of the point where the tape measure comes together. That number is your waist size.; ,   Stand with your feet and legs together. Wrap a tape measure around the fullest part of your hips, which usually lands roughly 8" below a woman's natural waist. Pull the tape measure taut. Note where the tape measure comes together. That number is your hip size.  Search for skirts that fall within your predicted clothing size. Different manufacturers may determine clothing sizes differently, so you should check each new sizing guide you encounter before trying on a skirt from an unfamiliar brand.  

measure your waist size.  measure your hip size.  compare the measurements against the sizing guide provided by the clothing manufacturer or store. 

 If you’re not already affiliated with one, contact a local animal shelter or humane society. Let them know that you’re interested in throwing a kitten shower to benefit their organization.While shelters and humane societies often plan their own kitten showers, they make great projects for Girl and Boy Scout troops, church or civic organizations, or a group of animal loving friends. A shower is typically held at the shelter or humane society it benefits.; , In the Northern Hemisphere, many shelters are in greatest need during the month of April. While a shelter or humane society would doubtlessly benefit from a charitable event any time of the year, a springtime shower will have the greatest impact., A kitten shower involves lots of groundwork and careful planning. Recruiting around twenty volunteers will make sure the work is accomplished without one or a few people getting overwhelmed.The shelter or humane society likely has a pool of regular volunteers. Recruit helpers from this pool and send out a request to the shelter's email list. Their staff can also help plan and run the event. Find additional volunteers by asking other members of your troop or organization, coworkers, or neighbors. If you have kids, ask around their daycare or school.  Once you’ve assembled your team, make sure everyone has a clear task or tasks. Examples of duties that you should delegate include:Set up and clean up crews Invitation and press release design Marketing coordinator Foster and adoption coordinators (likely members of the shelter’s staff) Food prep and serving Donation collectors Raffle and game coordinators  , Ask local restaurants to donate food as soon as possible, preferably months in advance. Many have a limited budget for charitable donations, so you’ll want to make sure they can provide you with some light bites.Ask multiple restaurants to donate one appetizer instead of relying on one to cater the entire event. Ask in person or send a friendly email. If the shelter or humane society can provide a charitable donation receipt so the restaurant can use the donation as a tax write-off, use that as an incentive. You should also see if a restaurant or other local business can provide a gift certificate or other prizes that you can use for raffles and games., Buy balloons, streamers, tablecloths, cups, plates, napkins, and other items from a dollar store to keep your budget low. You should be able to decorate and supply the event for less than $100 (US).You can also see if restaurants donating food can also supply serving-ware and napkins.  You don’t have to limit donation drop-offs to the shower date and location. Ask local pet supply stores, groomers, and other pet-related businesses if they can set up a donation station on premises.Ask if they’re willing to accept donations throughout the entire month instead of just on the day of the shower.  Not everyone will want to donate supplies, so you should make sure you’re able to field cash donations. Make sure your system is simple and secure. To enable guests to donate money via credit or debit, use a mobile credit card reader linked to an account in the shelter’s name.For example, some shelters in Florida, USA, use WeGive.org to collect donations in multiple payment methods. The site also allows shelters to list information about what various dollar amounts will buy, like toys, food, and veterinary care. 

work with a local shelter or humane society.  schedule a kitten shower in the spring.  recruit around twenty volunteers.  assign tasks to each volunteer.  ask local businesses to provide food and prizes.  purchase decorations and supplies from the dollar store.  ask local pet-related businesses to collect donations.  set up a system for collecting money donations. 

 Typically, you have to report all self-employed income, which can come from a variety of sources. For example, the following are examples of self-employed income:If you are an independent contractor, then you need to count anything reported on a 1099-MISC as well as any amount of money you have been paid, even if it wasn’t reported to the IRS. If you own a corporation, then you need to include your business income. You might be the owner of an LLC, PC, S-corp, or C-corp. If you are a partner in a business, then you are also self-employed. You will know if you are partner if you receive a Form K-1 at the end of the year. If you own rental property, then you are also self-employed. The rents you collect count as self-employed income.; , You need to go through and add up all of the income. This will give you a number that is your “gross income.”You will not use your gross income in the calculation. However, it is your starting point.  When you file your income tax return, you might make deductions for necessary and ordinary business expenses. Depending on your state, you might not be able to make all of these deductions when calculating child support. For example, in Tennessee, you cannot take a “depreciation deduction.”, You have to report more than your self-employed income. You also need to report any source of income, no matter how small. People sometimes forget that they get income from more than one source. You will also have to add the following income:Salaries and wages Pension income Income from trusts and estates or annuities Social Security benefits Veterans’ or military personnel benefits Alimony from a spouse Unemployment insurance benefits Disability benefits Workers’ compensation benefits  , In order to arrive at your “net” income, you also can make certain deductions, which will depend on your state. For example, in Illinois, you can deduct the following:Federal and state income taxes Social security tax Any retirement contributions that are mandatory Any union dues Health insurance premiums Necessary medical expenses  , Once you have your net income, then you can get an estimate of how much child support you will pay by using a calculator. There are many calculators on the Internet, and you should find a state-specific calculator. You can find them in a variety of places:   Some websites, such as Alllaw, have a calculator for every state: http://www.alllaw.com/calculators/childsupport  Your state may have a calculator hosted on a state website. For example, you can find Indiana’s calculator at the state’s Supreme Court website., Most states have a formula which they use to calculate child support. The formula typically considers your gross income and the number of children that you need to support. You can find the formula online and use it instead of a calculator to estimate your child support payments.   For example, in Texas, you will need to pay 20% of your net income for one child, 25% for two children, and 30% for three children., Many states allow a judge to adjust the amount of child support depending on other factors. The judge will use the formula as a starting point but may adjust up or down depending on the circumstances. The precise factors will differ depending on your state. However, they could include the following:Specific needs of the child, such as day care, educational expenses, and health insurance The incomes of both parents The ability of the paying parent to pay child support The child’s standard of living before the separation  , Every state law is a little different, so you need to read up on how your state in particular will calculate child support, and what kinds of deductions they allow. Although states may be generally the same, there will be individual wrinkles to each state’s laws.   You can find your state’s law online. Search “child support” and “your state.” Look for state government websites which publish this information.  You might need help calculating your business income. If so, then you should seek the help of an accounting professional, such as a certified public accountant. You can find a qualified accountant in the following manner:Ask friends, family, and business colleagues if they would recommend their accountant. Search in the Yellow Pages. Get a referral from your state’s Society of Certified Public Accountants. Your state’s Society should have a website.  A family law attorney can advise you how to convince the judge to adjust the guideline amount up or down. A family lawyer can also represent you in court if there is a lot of money in dispute.   You can find a lawyer by contacting your state’s bar association and asking for a referral.Once you have the name of someone, you should call them up and schedule a consultation. Ask how much the consultation will cost.  

identify all sources of self-employed income.  total your gross income.  subtract self-employed business expenses.  add other income.  subtract required deductions.  use a calculator.  find your state’s formula.  analyze what other factors judges consider.  read your state law.  ask an accounting professional questions.  meet with a lawyer. 

 Depending on the age and playing level of the athletes, you may not need to learn everything right away. You can study the basics by reading manuals on the rules, basics of the game, and penalties. Then you can watch other games and learn something from other coaches, either local or televised, to get a feel for the rhythm of the game.   The company called Sports Interactive is now making games that can provide little experience in how to coach and how to manage the club. The game is called Football Manager 2011. If you play this game most of the time, it gives little bit of experience in coaching, the knowledge and teaches coaches to be better coach.      ; ,, In small communities you just have to volunteer to be a soccer coach but you don’t get paid.

It’s important because in professional coach you have to pay the player with their skills standards and position so good players get more money in their wages and also you need to buy new players from other clubs. The money helps to keep the club in shape, and you need insurance on equipment such as team bus, other gear and maybe the soccer field too.  There is lot of media involved in the soccer coaching and soccer in general for example; television, radio, the newspaper; the most important thing is the magazine. They bring out new FIFA magazine English premier league every month.  There are a lot of injuries in this sport industry when players get injured will need physiologist, therapists and physiotherapists. These people get employed by the soccer club full time. Health services are needed because as a coach you need to know if your players are in good shape and if they can play the next game so health services are the most important thing you need to have as a coach.  Transport is also involved in soccer without transport you can’t go and play away games. In big clubs and international teams you will need transport like plane and bus. But some rich clubs usually have their own bus.        It is also active because in this career you don’t sit around, you have to go in the field and demonstrate to player what you want them to do some times.       In this career sometimes you need hands on your self helping others because as manager you actually employ people to work for you because you need a coach in each position on the field you need a coach for midfield, striker defense and goalkeeper so you have to help those coaches some times.        

understand the basics of the game.  know what makes good soccer coach:  good communication skills  guide player  help players when they need you  inspire players  empowering player  develop their potential  motivate player  is a good listener  is disciplined  leads by example  ,  decide whether to pursue this professionally.train the players so that they can produce entertainment in the game to the community (fans) because the fans come to support the team so you and the team have to give back to the community people can watch this sport on tv which is part of entertainment .  get the finances in order.  know your media.  enlist the help of health and medical professionals.  get transportation figured out.  become familiar with industry characteristics:  it is an outdoor oriented career because when coaches work they work outdoors.

 Everyone is familiar with the cat’s meow. This all-purpose “talk” can mean many things, but primarily it means “pay attention to me as I want something from you.” Your cat may want food, attention, petting or may even be signaling that it doesn't want to be touched. Cat owners soon learn to interpret the nuances of their cat’s meowing knowing precisely what’s on their cat’s mind.   After spending some time with your cat, you should be able to understand the difference between your cats meows depending on a variety of variables, such as the time of day or the location of your cat when it meows.; , Purring is another familiar cat vocalization. While not all cats purr when they are happy, it is a good sign if you are actively petting your cat and it begins to purr. Just don't be discouraged if your cat never purrs, it might just not be in its vocabulary.   Contented cats purr, but cats in distress have also been known to purr. It is believed that purring in these situations, such as when a cat is ill, is a way for the cat to “call” for help.  Hissing and growling is understood to mean that a cat is afraid and/or angry. NEVER pick up a hissing or growling cat, as it may display aggression and bite you. Leave hissing or growling cats alone if you can or approach them cautiously with a thick towel and leather gloves if you absolutely need to pick them up.  

learn what your cat's meows mean.  understand your cat's purring.  learn what your cat is trying to communicate when it hisses or growls.

 If subtlety fails, you can use emojis to convey anger via text. Emoticons and emojis make the expression of emotions more concise and accessible, and reduce the ambiguity of a message’s meaning.The vast number of emojis available can make pretending to be angry over text a creative endeavor!  , Typing in capital letters has come to signify yelling, making it an ideal way to sound angry in a text message.It is a visually intense and attention-grabbing way of letting someone know how you feel, and a good strategy for conveying rage. To sound angry, try writing neutral statements all in caps.   Example- "Don't worry about it!" vs. "DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT!"  , Ending a sentence with a period while texting is often perceived as less sincere than using no punctuation at all.The finality of using a period is considered overly formal, angry and unenthusiastic within the context of a text message, where casual writing is normally preferred.Along these lines, opt to use periods over other punctuation to make otherwise friendly phrases sound angry (e.g. “Have a good night!” vs. “Have a good night.”)  

send unhappy or angry faced emojis.  text in capital letters.  end your sentences with periods. 

 He will only ever be your friend: The key here is to be oblivious. When he starts dropping hints about how good you two would be together, just shrug it off with a laugh. If he tells you about how much he likes a 'girl,' but she does not seem to notice, just nod sympathetically and say "that sucks" or "that's too bad, you really deserve better." Then, quickly change the subject.; , He will start to realise that you value him as a confidante and he will be even more reluctant to wreck things by needlessly confessing his feelings.  When guys fall in love or 'like' they put the girl on a pedestal. To him, everything about you is perfect. You must destroy this pedestal and quickly. This could mean really embarrassing things like letting him see you without makeup (if you always wear it) or tell an inconvenient truth like "I can't wait to move away after school/college/this job finishes and travel. I'd hate to get tied down!" Pretty much do the opposite of what you would do or say to a guy you have a crush on.  Just say you're too busy or you might be feeling really sick or you've already made plans. If he's really persistent, you might have to be cruel to be kind. Tell him you're going on a date.  Regular outings like shopping or team sports is great; that's the sort of thing you do with your regular friends.  If he is upset or angry or hurt, you are welcome to comfort him. Avoid hugging or anything too emotionally attached.  Tell him the dreaded "I'm sorry, but I only like you as a friend." Let him lick his wounds then practice steps 2-6 consistently. If he is still persistent, then its time to stop seeing him for a while.  

remember that he is your friend.  make him see the value of your friendship: talk about your boyfriend, commiserate with him over your life dramas, make it clear that you are absolutely comfortable with him because, to you, he is sexless.  let him see the negative side of you: you might be prone to gossiping, hate children, really messy or you swear way too much.  decline invitations to go out to dinner or anything resembling a date with just the two of you.  meeting for coffee after class or work is fine, but don't do it too often.  lead by example: be a good friend to him, but don't go too far.  if he started this whole mess by declaring his feelings, be kind, but firm. 

 If you're unsure where to start with a Hannah Montana look, start with the juniors section. The juniors section is a section of a department or clothing store that sells items for preteen and teenaged girls. Even if you're older and do not still fit into juniors size clothing, browsing the juniors section can give you a sense of the proper Hannah Montana attire. Hannah Montana was meant to be a preteen girl, so her tastes would be fitting with the juniors section.Hannah Montana was known for wearing bright colors or pastel shades of pink and purple. Keep in mind, however, Hannah Montana is a somewhat dated show. While the juniors section can help, avoid any trends that have been popular in recent history. This will not mesh with the style at the time Hannah Montana was on the air.; , Hannah Montana was the child of a famous country stare in the show, so shirts with a country-western inspired look can help. Go for something like a plaid button down top. This can help give off the country vibe Hannah Montana is known for.As Hannah Montana was a preteen girl, a brighter western shirt may help. A pink button down plaid top, for example, would be a good choice.  Hannah Montana was known for layering her outfits. Grab a jacket, cardigan, or blazer to throw over your top.Once again, girlish colors are best. Go for shades like pink, purple, yellow, and pastels. If you're going for a blazer or jacket, look for one with clunky buttons. Hannah Montana wore a lot of blazers/jackets with big, metallic buttons. Some of Hannah Montana's blazers had decorations. A beige blazer with flowers or butterflies embroidered on the sleeves can be a nice choice.  Hannah frequently performed somewhat casually. If you're doing a cowgirl look, go for bootcut jeans or similarly casual pants. For example, capris could work as they're generally cut in a way that can show off cowboy boots., Hannah did occasionally wear skirts over jeans. If you want a more girlish iteration of Hannah Montana, a colorful miniskirt can help. This can be worn with bright tights or leggings underneath.   If you're wearing your costume to school, check your school's dress policy. Skirts may have to be a certain length to be appropriate for school property.  Hannah Montana was known for her cowboy boots. Make sure you add a pair of cowboy boots to your costume if you want to dress like Hannah Montana.   If possible, make sure the boots are specifically sold as cowboy boots. In a pinch, any knee-high boot can work, but cowboy boots will truly solidify the Hannah Montana vibe.  You can buy Hannah Montana DVDs, watch Hannah Montana online, or use a video steaming service to watch episodes. If you need some inspiration for your outfit, watching some Hannah Montana episodes can help give you ideas. If you find a particular outfit you like, you can try to copy that outfit for your Hannah Montana look.  If you're doing a Hannah Montana costume, carrying around a microphone can really help. Most costume shops will sell fake foam microphones you can add to your costume. Having a microphone on hand during a party can help signify to people that you're imitating the fictional pop star.If you don't have time to run to the costume store, you can easily make a fake microphone. Take a cardboard tube and glue a ball, such as a tennis ball, to the end. Then, paint the tennis ball and cardboard black.  If you have long, blond hair, you already have the Hannah Montana hairstyle. Use a flat iron to straighten your hair before going out in your costume.Wash your hair with a volumizing shampoo before straightening it, and use a heat protectant on your hair. You can find these products at a local beauty salon. Make sure your hair is completely dry before you begin the straightening process. Make sure you select a lower heat setting. Setting the heat too high could damage your hair. Work with one section at a time. Move the flat iron from the root of your hair to the tip, moving slowly. Go over each strand only once.  You may not have hair that can be easily turned into Hannah Montana hair. If this is the case, you can buy a large blond wig. In fact, this may be more realistic as Hannah Montana wore a wig in the series as her natural hair was brown. You can find a wig at a costume shop or buy one online.  Add a scarf to your outfit. Hannah Montana is known for her girly, preppy attire, and scarves can really show this off. Go for a thin, sparkly scarf that you can tie around your neck for the party.You can find a lot of scarves by browsing the juniors section at a local department store. Make sure to choose a bright colored scarf.  You should also browse the juniors section for bright jewelry. Somewhat over-the-top jewelry can help you look like Hannah Montana. Opt for colorful, dangly earrings with a lot of sparkle and shine. You can also buy bright bracelets and necklaces.   Keep in mind dangly jewelry can be painful for some people. If the jewelry is causing your earlobes to become sore, it's a good idea to remove it. While earrings can help add flare to your costume, if you commit in other areas, you can still look like Hannah Montana.  Hannah Montana did not wear a lot of makeup, but she was known for her eye shadow. She usually used somewhat neutral shades to match her skin tone. You can choose a shade to match your skin for a Hannah Montana look. However, sometimes Hannah Montana had more dramatic eye shadow.   A blue shade or a purple or pink shade can help with the Hannah Montana look. This may be particularly apt if you're going as Hannah Montana during a performance.Pick a series of colors so you can layer your eye shadow. You should not use a single color. At a drug store, you may be able to buy a shade of eye shadow with three separate sections: one for the lid, one for the corners, and one for the crease. However, you can also simply select three shades of a similar color that range from dark to light.  Once you've chosen your eyeshadow, you can start to apply it. Start with your darkest shade and use a makeup brush, or the brush that came with the container, to gently dab that color along your eyelid.From there, apply your second lightest shade to your brow bone. This is the area of skin above your eyelid and just below your eyebrow. Lightly spread some lighter eyeshadow along your brow bone. Take your lightest shade and apply it to the crease between your brow bone and lid. Then, spread a clean brush along your eyelid, crease, and brow bone to blend the colors together slightly.  Hannah Montana did not wear a lot of makeup. Much of her makeup was toned down, so you do not need a bright lipstick. A neutral shade of lipstick, such as purplish shade similar to the natural color of your lips, will do. Simply run the tip of the lipstick along your lips until they are fully colored. It can help to rub your lips together when you're done, as this will blend the colors slightly., Once you've finished with your eye shadow, add a small amount of black eye liner. You can use liquid eye liner or pencil eyeliner. Make sure to only apply a small amount, as Hannah Montana was not known for her excessive makeup. All you need are a couple of thin lines outlining the lids of your eyes.Start with your upper lids. Draw a thin line of eyeliner running across the top of your eye, just above your eyelashes. Start near the pupil and slowly draw the line to the outer corner. Make sure to work slowly and carefully, as it's easy to smudge eye liner. You can also draw a smaller line on your bottom lid, running about halfway through the bottom lid to the corner. You'll want this line to merge with the line on your upper lid.  If you want more makeup, you can add a light layer of liquid or powder foundation. You can also dab some blush on the apples of your cheeks to brighten your face. However, this is strictly optional. Hannah Montana did not wear much makeup beyond eyeshadow, so this may not be necessary to get the look down.   If you opt for foundation, just focus on covering blemishes and smoothing over skin discolorations. Do not apply a heavy amount as you do not want the makeup to look caked on.  

browse the juniors section to find girlish attire.  go for a country western top.  opt for a jacket, cardigan, or blazer.  go for jeans or other somewhat casual pants.  try a skirt.  wear cowboy boots.  watch episodes of hannah montana for inspiration.  get a fake microphone.  straighten your hair if you have long, blond hair.  opt for a wig if your hair doesn't work.  wear a scarf.  look for colorful, somewhat juvenile jewelry.  choose a shade of eye shadow.  apply eye shadow.  choose a light lipstick.  add a small amount of eye liner.  finish up with a light layer of foundation and some blush. 

; ,, Crop it and do whatever else you want to make it look nice and the way it does in real life. , In Photoshop, there's an Invert option.  Even if the original real photo was 4x6, you can make this an 8x10. The only upward size limit is the size of the transparency you'll be printing on, which for most of us is 8.5x11.  This is really IMPORTANT.  They have to be loaded into your printer in a certain way, so that the ink prints must be on the rough side not the slippery side, in this which case you will have a huge mess. , If your dialog box that comes up before you print has an option for what sort of paper you are printing on, choose "transparency."  , You will need not to touch the printer area, and you will need to store the print in an undisturbed place, sticky/rough/inky side up for a few minutes to let everything dry. Even after everything is dry, be very careful not to get the print wet. This will cause the print to run, and you'll have to start over.  You have now created a giant "negative" that you can use to make a contact print, just like you do with your sheet of cut-up developed negatives. Go to the darkroom with all your materials and set up as if you were making a regular contact print. A sheet of glass (clean and unscratched) is helpful for keeping the print-negative flat against the paper you want the new image to show up on.REMEMBER, this is a contact print, so you don't have to lay the computer-printed image backwards.  You will almost certainly have to adjust the exposure to get a print with the same darkness and tones as the original photograph, but you can do it. I would suggest trying a very low light exposure and working your way to a higher light or longer exposure., Do your developing thing. If it turns out rubbish, try again. The rest you already know if you're a photographer. 

scan your precious family photos.  move the file to the computer you'll be working at.  ,  open the image file with the photo editing program.  make sure the "color setting" or "mode" is set to gray scale (in photoshop, it's under mode).  ,  use whatever feature your program has to "invert" the light and dark spots of the image.  size the image to the size you want.  save your file.  read the instructions on the transparency sheets.  load the transparency into your printer.  ,  print your image.  when the printer is done, very carefully remove the print from the printer.  hooray!,  now expose!,  develop! 

 Plants with under ripe or ripe vegetables will not have gone to seed yet. A vegetable needs to completely finish a developmental cycle before the seeds are fully mature. As a result, you should wait until the vegetables are brown and overripe.; , Cut the vegetable open with a sharp, clean knife and scoop the pulpy, seed-filled flesh into a bucket.   Note that for tomatoes, you can throw the entire vegetable into a bucket instead of scooping out the inside.  After several days, it will begin to rot. As the flesh rots, the seeds will separate and rise to the surface of the water. Viable seeds, on the other hand, will sink to the bottom.  Pour the water through a find mesh sieve, performing the action carefully to prevent the loss of seeds. Rinse the seeds by pouring new water into the bucket or by running them under water in a fine sieve.  Spread the rinsed seeds out on newspaper or clean paper towels. Let them sit in a room temperature location for several days until completely dry. Move them around periodically to prevent the seeds from germinating, however.  

pick vegetables that are overripe.  scoop the inside out.  add water to the bucket and let the flesh sit.  change the water after the seeds separate.  dry the clean seeds. 

 Women should dress in conservative skirts and dresses. Men should prioritize a clean-cut look, wearing things like khakis, plain dress shirts, and school uniforms. Keep your style simple. Yandere is something you feel in the heart while appearing normal on the outside.Keep your hairstyle simple. Avoid showy or edgy cuts.

 Nothing beats aerobic exercise in the battle against belly fat. A study by Duke University found that aerobic exercise was the most effective way to burn deep, visceral belly fat and that aerobic workouts burn 67% more calories than resistance training or a regimen that combines cardio and resistance.The Department of Health and Human Services recommends that healthy adults get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity (think brisk walking or swimming) or 75 minutes a week of vigorous aerobic activity (such as running) spread throughout the week. Activity sessions can broken up throughout the day but should be at least 10 minutes long. If you're looking to lose weight, you'll have to increase the intensity, the duration or both.

Tighten your abs and crunch up until your shoulders are off the ball. Then use both hands to reach the dumbbell or the medicine ball up toward the ceiling. Do three sets of 12-15 reps resting for 30 seconds between each set.  Arms Over Straight-Leg Crunch. Grab a pair of 10- to 12-pound dumbbells and lie on your back with your arms behind you and your legs extended and raised to a 45-degree angle. Bring your arms up over your chest and lift your shoulders off the mat while raising your legs until they're perpendicular to the floor. Return to your starting position without letting your legs touch the floor. Do three sets of 15 repetitions with a 30-second rest period between sets.  Your core is made up of your abdominal muscles plus the muscles of your lower back, pelvic floor and hips--more than 15 muscles in all. For a really flat stomach, you need exercises that target all of these muscles.    Side Plank. Lie on your left side with your elbow directly beneath your shoulder and your legs stacked one on top of the other. Place your right hand on your left shoulder or on your right hip. Tighten your abs and lift your hips off the floor until you're balancing on your forearm and feet so that your body forms a diagonal line. Hold for 30 to 45 seconds. Repeat on the opposite side.  If you can’t hold the pose for 30 to 45 seconds, stay up as long as you can and work you way up.    Push-up Walkout. Get on the floor in a push-up position and place your hands so they're two inches wider than your shoulders. Keeping your feet in place, walk your hands out as far as possible, then walk back. Do 10-12 reps.  For more of challenge, you can lift one leg before you walk your hands out and back.    Climbing Rope. Sit down with your legs extended out in front of you and your feet turned out in a V position. Point your toes. Contract your core muscles and roll your spine into a C-curve. Lift your arms up and move them as if you were climbing a rope twisting slightly with each reach. Do 20 reaches with each arm.  

go with cardio.  do your crunches.  work your core. 

 The best way to help your child prepare for an MRI is to talk to them about it beforehand, describe what will happen, and answer questions. Generally speaking, for kids 2 and under, this will be most effective on the way to the appointment. For kids 11 and over, this preparation can come weeks in advance.Use this chart to decide when you should begin preparing your child for their MRI:   2 years old – speak to them on the way to the appointment 3-5 years old – speak to them the day before the appointment 6-10 years old – speak to them a few days before the appointment 11 years old and up – speak to them a week or two before the appointment; , Using simple, straightforward terms, tell your child everything that is going to happen. Speak to your child's doctor to get a specific overview of your child’s procedure. Details can differ from patient to patient, such as the length of the procedure, the use of sedatives, and the use of an IV.Your child will lie on a “special,” movable bed that will slide into a narrow opening. They might go in head or feet first, depending on what’s being examined. A large magnet will create a kind of “force-field” around your child. This is totally painless; they will not feel the radio waves directed at them. You child will hear some clicking, buzzing, and thumping noises. They may wear earplugs or headphones to help block the noise. For some procedures they may also need to wear a special helmet. During this process, it is very important for your child to stay still, “like a statue.” Many MRIs last from 30 to 45 minutes, but your child’s could be shorter or longer than this. When it is finished, your child will slide out of the tube. If they have been given an IV, this will be taken out. If you child has been given medicine (a sedative), they will still be pretty sleepy for several hours. When the procedure is over, you can go home together. Your child will probably be scheduled for a follow-up appointment to review their results.  Some MRIs will require the use of a contrast dye to make the images clearer. This dye is administered using an IV. The doctor can let you know if this will be a part of your child’s MRI, and if so, be sure to talk to your child about this aspect too.A tourniquet, or “stretchy rubber band,” will be placed on your child’s arm to help the nurse find a vein. The nurse will clean the skin, and may spray the area with a cold “freeze spray.” This will help numb the area. The nurse will then prick your child with a small needle, and place a tiny tube inside the opening. The cold spray will help make this less painful. Also, the needle will come out right away and only the little tube will remain. Any pain will only last for a few seconds. Finally, the nurse will place tape on the tube to help keep it in place. You may want to distract your child during this process, but they are welcome to watch if they prefer.  Once you have explained the procedure to your child, give them a chance to ask questions. Provide clear, honest answers. If there is an answer you don’t know, consider calling the doctor together to find out. Remember that kids may need some time to formulate their concerns, so be prepared to answer questions minutes, days, or weeks after your initial talk.Some kids might ask:  “Is this going to hurt?” ”How does the test work?” ”How long will I be in the tube?” "How will I feel when the test is done?”   You can explain:  ”The test won’t hurt your body at all. There will be some loud noises, so you can wear earplugs or headphones to keep your ears safe.” ”A machine uses a big magnet—like what we have on the fridge, but way stronger—and radio waves—like the sounds coming out of our radio—to take picture inside your body.” ”Let’s call the doctor and see if they can tell us how long your MRI will go.” Depending on whether or not your child will take a sedative, you can either say, “You should feel totally normal,” or “You might feel sleepy for a while, but you can come home and watch movies.”    , You know your child best, and all children are individuals. When you talk to your child, and how you talk to your child, is up to you. The most important thing is simply to help them mentally prepare, assuage any fears they may have, and be available to answer their questions. 

choose the best time.  describe what is going to happen.  explain the iv.  answer questions.  trust your instincts. 

 Cleaning your ears under these circumstances can be extremely dangerous, so do not use this method if you even suspect a problem. Instead, schedule a medical appointment immediately. Symptoms of an ear infection include:Fever. Vomiting or diarrhea. Green or yellow drainage from the ears. Persistent and severe ear pain.; , You can purchase a carbamide peroxide cleaning solution at your local pharmacy, or you can make your own. Combine warm water with one of the following   A teaspoon or two of 3-4% hydrogen peroxide solution A teaspoon or two of mineral oil A teaspoon or two of glycerin  , You can simply pour the solution into your ear from the bowl if you don't have an applicator on-hand. However, if you do have one around, it can make the process a little tidier and easier.   Use a large plastic syringe with a plastic tip, a rubber bulb syringe, or even an eyedropper. Fill the applicator with the solution. Draw up enough so that the applicator is more than halfway full.  The cleaning process will work better if your ear canal is as close to vertical as possible. Allow the ear you're cleaning to face upward.   Lie down on your side, if you can. Just be sure to put some towels under your head to catch any excess solution.  Pour the solution from the bowl into your ear, or position the end of the applicator a few inches above (not in) the ear canal and squeeze.   If you used hydrogen peroxide, you may hear a fizzing or popping sound. Don't worry, this is totally normal! If you can, you might want to ask another person to do this step for you. It'll be easier for him or her to make sure the solution is actually getting into your ear.  Keep your head tilted to the side and give the solution some time to break up the earwax. Five to 10 minutes should be sufficient.   If you used hydrogen peroxide, allow the solution to work until you no longer hear fizzing or popping.  Hold an empty bowl under your ear, or put a cotton ball up to the outside of your ear. Tilt your head slowly, and allow the liquid to drain out.   Be careful that you don't push the cotton swab into your ear — simply hold it lightly against the outside of the ear, so it's positioned to catch the fluid.  After the wax has softened, use a rubber bulb syringe to flush out loosened earwax. Gently squirt lukewarm water (at body temperature—98.6°F (37°C) into your ear canal. For very stubborn wax or for people with very small ear canals, an enema bottle filled with clean, warm water may work better than a bulb syringe.   Pull on the earlobe out and up to open up the ear canal. Do this over the sink, tub, or other container: it's a messy operation, and you may flush chunks of earwax out.  With excessive buildup, it may be necessary to repeat the process twice a day for no more than four to five days.   Don't drain your ears too often. Doing so could damage your eardrum and the sensitive skin in your ear canal.  When you're done flushing, place a towel over your ear, and tilt your head to the other side to drain the water. Gently pat the outside of your ear with a towel, then repeat the process on the other ear.  

be sure you don't have an ear infection or a perforated eardrum.  make your own wax-softening solution.  prepare an applicator (optional).  tilt your head to the side.  slowly put the solution into your ear.  allow the solution to work for a few minutes.  drain the fluid.  flush your ears.  irrigate your ears again.  dry your ears. 

 You'll need an electric motor or similar type rotary motor that runs on at least 12 volts; 18 volts would be ideal.   The motor will have a small shaft protruding from the center. Take a small four-hole button and attach it to that shaft with superglue. Be careful not to use so much glue that it seeps through the holes of the button and blocks them. They need to be open so that you can attach the needle. Set it aside to dry.       Instead of a button, you can use an eraser. Take the eraser from a mechanical pen and push it firmly onto the small shaft of your motor.   You can remove the motor from a VCR or remote control car, but the power will be considerably less; it's about 3.5 volts.      ; , The "tube" will guide the needle. It's easy to make one from a pencil or pen.   Use a mechanical pencil. An inexpensive plastic pencil will work fine, or you can choose one that's metal. Depending on your preference, you can leave the pencil as-is or cut it down to about a 3" to 4" length.       Alternately, you can use an everyday stick pen like a Bic and remove the ink cylinder from inside. If you want a shorter tube, cut the pen to about a 3" or 4" length. File down the brass tip of the pen to get the ball out and make the hole big enough to allow passage of the needle.  The brace will support the tube when it's attached to the machine motor for the tattoo gun.   Take a teaspoon and break off the bowl (the part you eat from). Then bend the spoon back to create an "L"-shape.       A second option would be to cut the bristles off of a toothbrush leaving about 4" in length. Use a lighter to heat up the plastic toothbrush handle and bend it into an "L" shape. Hold the bent handle in place until the plastic cools, and it becomes stiff.  Cut a metal guitar string an inch or so longer than the length of your tube. It should reach from the center of the motor to the tip of the tube after assembly. Put soap and water into a pot and bring it to a boil. Drop your needle into the pot and boil it for five minutes. Rinse it in clear water and then boil it again in water only.   You can prepare several needles in advance. If you do so, store them in a sterilized jar.        

find a motor.  create the tube.  design a brace.  make a needle. 

 If you see your child or family member twitching repeatedly, don't assume it'll become a permanent behavior. Instead, be patient and supportive of the person and try to understand how stress at home, work or school might play a role. In the vast majority of cases, twitches during childhood fade way within a few months anyway.On the other hand, a neurotic twitch that develops in an adult is less likely to resolve itself.   If a person has a neurotic twitch for a year or so, then TS is more likely, but it's still possible it might go away or become more mild and controlled. Emotional, psychological and physical stressors are linked to most neurotic disorders. As such, observe your child's routine to understand their primary stressors and alleviate them if possible.; , There are no lab or brain imaging tests used for diagnosing neurotic twitches, so the cause can be a bit of a mystery in most cases. Try not to get frustrated or too concerned with neurotic twitches, particularly in children, because they commonly fade away after a few months or so.Research the topic online (using reputable sources) to get an understanding of the condition and how common it is among children.   Serious disorders that can cause neurotic twitching need to be ruled out by your doctor. They include attention deficit disorder (ADHD), uncontrollable movements due to a neurological disease (myoclonus), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and epilepsy., Most doctors and psychologists recommend that family members and friends don't pay much attention to neurotic twitching or tics, at least at first.The rationale is that too much attention, especially if it's negative and involves disparaging remarks, can cause more stress and exacerbate the twitching. It's difficult to balance taking interest in someone's problem, but not going overboard with attention that feeds the problem.   Don't mimic the person's twitching in order to be funny or playful — it can make them more self-conscious or nervous. If the twitches don't go away within a few weeks, ask the person what's bothering them. Repetitive movements, such as sniffing and coughing, can also be caused by allergies, chronic infections or another illnesses. Deciding on treatment should depend on how disruptive the twitching is to the person's life, not how embarrassed you might be.  If the twitching is severe enough to cause social problems at school or work for a child or adult, then some form of counseling or therapy should be sought. Therapy typically involves a child psychologist or psychiatrist who uses cognitive behavioral interventions and/or psychotherapy.Over the course of multiple sessions, the child or adult should be accompanied by a close family member or friend for support.   Cognitive behavioral therapy includes habit reversal training, which helps to identify the urge to twitch or have repetitive behaviors and then teaches the patient to voluntarily combat them from occurring. Tics are often classified as "Involuntary" movements rather than involuntary ones, because the tics can be willfully suppressed for a period of time. However, this often results in discomfort that builds until the tic is performed.Psychotherapy involves more talking to the patient and asking probing questions. It helps more with accompanying behavioral problems, such as ADHD and OCD. Depression and anxiety are also quite common in people who develop neurotic twitches. Most twitching can't be halted completely with therapy, but it can be made less obvious or forceful.  There are prescription drugs to help control neurotic twitching and reduce the effects of related behavioral problems, but it depends if the condition is considered short term or long term, and if the person is a child or an adult.Drugs are not given to kids with TTD (temporary or transient tics), but are to those diagnosed with severe long-term TS. Psychotropic drugs change symptoms and behaviors, but they often have serious side effects, so discuss the pros and cons with your doctor.   Drugs that help control twitches by blocking dopamine in the brain include: fluphenazine, haloperidol (Haldol) and pimozide (Orap). Perhaps paradoxically, side effects include an increase in involuntary, repetitive tics. Botulinum (Botox) injections paralyze muscle tissue and are helpful for controlling mild and isolated twitching of the face / neck. ADHD drugs, such as methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin) and dextroamphetamine (Adderall, Dexedrine), can sometimes reduce neurotic twitching, but they can make them worse also. Central adrenergic inhibitors, such as clonidine (Catapres) and guanfacine (Tenex), can increase impulse control in kids and help them to reduce their anger / rage. Anti-seizure drugs used for epilepsy, such as topiramate (Topamax), can also help twitching in people with TS.Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that any medication will help reduce the symptoms of a neurotic tic disorder. In order to reduce the incidence of undesired side effects associated with medication, dosing should start low and increase slowly up to the point when side effects appear then stop or decrease., Neurotic twitching due to TS often begin between the ages of 2-15 years, with the average age of onset about 6 years of age.TS often lasts into adulthood, but it always starts at some point during childhood. TTD also starts before the age of 18 years, usually at 5-6 years old, but lasts less than a year in duration.There's a lot of similarity between the two conditions with age of onset, but TS often begins a little younger because of its stronger genetic link. Neurotic twitching that starts during adulthood is typically not diagnosed as either TS or TTD. The twitches must begin during childhood to be diagnosed TS or TTD. Males are 3-4x more likely than females to develop TS and TTD, although females have higher incidence of other behavioral / psychological problems.TS is hereditary and there is usually a genetic link between most cases.  The duration of the neurotic twitching is the biggest factor for distinguishing TS from TTD.To be diagnosed with TTD, a child has to exhibit twitching (tics) for at least 4 weeks on a daily basis, but less than a year.In contrast, for a diagnosis of TS, the twitching must occur for more than a year. As such, some time and patience are needed to get a proper diagnosis.   Most cases of TTD resolve and go away within weeks to months. Twitches that last around a year are called "chronic tics" until enough time passes to justify a diagnosis of TS. TTD is much more common than TS — 10% of children develop TTD, whereas about 1% of Americans (kids and adults) are diagnosed with TS.In contrast, about 1% of Americans have mild TS. About 200,000 are estimated to have severe TS (both kids and adults)., For a kid or adult to be diagnosed with TS, they must exhibit both at least two motor tics and at least one vocal tic in combination for over a year.Common motor tics include excessive blinking, nose twitching, grimacing, lip smacking, head turning or shoulder shrugging. Vocalizations can include simple grunts, repetitive throat clearing, as well as yelling out words or complex phrases. Numerous types of motor and vocal tics can occur in the same child who has TS.   In contrast, most children with TTD have either a single motor tic (twitch) or vocal tic, but rarely both at the same time. If your child or family member only shows some sort of neurotic twitching, then it's likely they have TTD and it will resolve on it's own fairly quickly (weeks or months). When repetitive words and phrases are spoken, it's considered a complex form of vocalization.  TS varies from mild to severe in terms of repetitive twitching and vocalizations, and tends to involve more complex movements. Complex tics involve several body parts and rhythmic or patterned movements, such as head bobbing while sticking out the tongue, for example.In contrast, children or adolescents with TTD sometimes display complex movements, but not nearly as often as seen with TS.   The most common initial symptoms of both TS and TTD are facial tics, such as rapid eye blinking (single or both), eyebrow raising, nose twitching, lip protruding, grimacing and sticking out the tongues. The initial facial tics that develop are often later added to or replaced by jerky movements of the neck, torso and/or limbs. A twitch in the neck usually jerks the head to one side. Twitches from both conditions typically happen many times per day (usually in bouts or bursts of activity) almost every day. Sometimes there are breaks that may last a few hours or so and do not occur when sleeping. Neurotic twitching often looks like really nervous behavior (thus the name) and can get worse with stress or anxiety and better when relaxed and calm.  A fairly reliable predictor of potential neurotic twitching behavior is whether or not the person has (or had) other disabilities, such as ADHD, OCD, autism, and/or depression.Serious problems in school with reading, writing and/or math may also be risk factors for developing neurotic twitching behavior.   OCD behaviors include intrusive thoughts and anxiety combined with repetitive actions. For example, excessive concern about germs or dirt might get associated with repetitive hand-washing through the day. Approximately 86% of kids with TS also have at least one additional mental, behavioral or developmental disability, usually either ADHD or OCD. 

be patient and don't assume the worst.  don't get frustrated with diagnosing.  don't pay too much attention to it.  consider some form of counseling or therapy.  ask your doctor about medication.  pay attention to age and gender.  notice how long the twitching lasts.  take note of any tics.  observe the complexity of the twitching.  watch for associated conditions. 

 While such snacks are not necessarily healthy, they do tend to be lower calorie than other candy options. If you want to buy snacks in the theater, these are generally your best choice of candy. In addition to being lower calorie than other varieties, they are chewier. This means they're more difficult to eat. If you take longer to finish your candy, you're less likely to return to the concession stand for a second helping.Twizzlers have the lowest calorie count, containing only about 165 calories. Milk duds contain 370 calories, while Starbursts contain 480 calories. Keep in mind, if you're on a specific diet plan that restricts sugar, this is not the best route for you. While these snacks are lower calorie, the bulk of the calories come from sugar.; , Many movie theaters now sell protein bars at the counter. You can also sneak one in from a nearby gas station or drug store. Lower calorie protein bars may contain some ingredients you're craving, like nuts and chocolate, while still having some nutrients.Remember to read nutritional labels. Some protein bars may be misleading. In general, it's best to skip bars with a lot of added sugar.  Swedish Fish are much lower in sugar than the average movie snack. They also tend to have a tougher texture, making chewing them difficult. If you slow down the pace of your eating, you will eat less overall.A serving of Swedish Fish is about 19 pieces, roughly a large handful, and contains only 140 calories and 29 grams of sugar. Movie theater containers tend to be smaller, so you may find a container that has a single serving. If you can't find a smaller container, try splitting one with a friend.  As it can be tricky to find candy that's lower calorie at the theater, consider bringing in your own snacks. Some theaters allow this, so ask ahead of time. If the theater does not allow it, you can sneak in food in your purse, bag, or pockets if healthy eating is really important to you. You can bring very healthy snacks from outside, which you would likely be unable to find in a theater. You can try things like:Dry, lightly sweetened cereal Granola bars Fruit  

go for twizzlers, milk duds, or starbursts.  buy a protein bar.  look for swedish fish.  ask about the theater's food policy.

 A simple system of notation is used when describing Rubik's cube algorithms. You'll need to understand how this system works before beginning.  There is a letter to indicate each face of the cube.  F = front (the side facing you) L = left (the vertical face on your left-hand side) R = right (vertical face on your right-hand side) B = back (the side that faces directly away from you) U = top (the side that faces upward) D = down (the side that faces downward)   Any of the letters, by itself, means to turn that side clockwise 90°. A 2 before any letter means to turn that side 180°. A ' before any letter means to turn that side counterclockwise 90°. FC means "favorite color."       ,, This will be your U face.,, Then use one of the following sequences to move it to the top.,,,,, It will be the color that is on all of the disoriented remaining cubes., You have to get those into the correct position).,,, Looking at the bottom face, identify it from one of the following patterns:,,,,,, Note: This is much easier if you can solve a 3x3x3 cube.       ; , This will be your Favorite Colour (FC). ,,, Then twist the side that does not have these two down to the bottom (180 degrees), and position the correct block under the correct place.  Repeat with the other block.  Halfway. Next, turn the whole cube upside down, so the top = bottom.  For example, the only color not used so far is on the current top.  Repeat: repeat down up left right until that block is orientated the right way up.  Then make the top layer sides match the bottom layer sides.  You've done it.  Use the R' D' R D algorithm to place the corners into the chosen face., This can get get a bit complicated! If you have a singe yellow dot place on the bottom left, if you have a horizontal line place it at the top and if you have a diagonal line place it so that it is pointing to the top right., This is exactly like how you place the corners on the 3X3X3 rubik's cube. Use the R' F R' B2 R F' R' B2 R2 U'., This should be easy to do, but if you get stuck, use the algorithms below. Find a white piece on the top face and put it above the space on the bottom face you need it to move to. This step is finished if the white face is complete and the layer above it is also complete.   If a white piece is on the top face, use the following algorithm: F, U', F', 2U. Once this part is complete, use one of the algorithms below based on the location of a white face. If a white piece is on the right side of one of the "cubelets" on the top face, use the following algorithm: R, U, R'. You might need to turn the whole cube so that the white piece is on the right side. If a white piece is on the left side of one of the "cubelets" on the top face, use the following algorithm: L',U', L. You might need to turn the whole cube so that the white piece is on the left side. If a white piece is near the bottom, you will need to move it up, then do one of the algorithms.  It doesn't need to look exactly like the pieces at the top., Find a yellow piece on the top with another yellow piece next to it on the layer below, as shown in the picture. Then do the algorithm: R, U, R', U, R, 2U, R'. This is by far the longest part of the process. If you cannot find the pattern shown in the picture, do the algorithm again. If after repeated attempts you still can't get the pattern, it would be best to scramble the cube and start over.  By now you should have solved the yellow and white faces. Do a "U-turn," turning the top layer until there is another face solved (any color is fine)., Then do the following algorithm: R', F, R', 2B, R, F', R', 2B, 2R., 

know the notations.choose your fc.  find a face that has your fc.find a corner cube that belongs beside the cube on the u face.  turn the d face until the desired cube is under where you want it to be.  if your fc on the corner cube is on the r face: r' d' r.  if your fc on the corner cube is on the f face: f d f'.  if your fc on the corner cube is on the d face: r' d2 r d r' d' r.do these steps until the whole up face is done.  down face  look at the down face and figure out what colour the down face is.  the first step is to position all of the cubes (the bottom face is made up of 4 cubes.  swap fld and frd cubes: r' d' r f d f' r' d r d2.  swap fld and brd cubes: r' d' r f d2 f' r' d r d2.  when all the cubes are positioned, the next step is to orient them.after that, use the face that is currently at the top as the front to do one of these sequences:,  for patterns 1, 5, 6, and 7, do: r' d' r d' r' d2 r d2.  for patterns 2, 3, and 4, do: d2 r' d2 r d r' d r.continue the orientation sequences until the cube is solved.  finished.  ,  use the basic 'down left up right' algorithm to get the first layer finished, then the second layer.  find a color that you like.  get two fc blocks next to each other.  ,  find another fc block, and put it next to the other two by simply twisting it up, or by moving the other blocks out of the way, moving the third fc block up, and moving the first two back onto their original positions.  ,  repeat this algorithm until all of the fc blocks are facing one way and on one layer.  ,  now find the two fc blocks that have one pair of corner colours the same.  use the down up left right algorithm continuously until it is the right way up and the corners match one of the first two fc blocks' corners.  congrats!,  then go: down up left right, down up left right, until one of the blocks is facing the right way.  turn the top layer to your left (looking from the top, twist clockwise).  repeat the turn, and repeat the algorithm and turn twice more.  brag.  place the corners with the classic algorithm.  oll.  pll.  solve the white face.  your cube should now look like the cube shown above: the white face solved, with the red and green layers above it.  solve the yellow face.  solve a third face.  turn the cube so that the most recently completed face is facing away from you.  repeatedly do "u-turns" until the cube is solved.  

 You may have a collection of shampoos that are meant to tame frizz, define curls, and smooth waves. What they probably all have in common is a few chemicals that actually make dry, rough hair worse: sulfates. Buy shampoo that is completely free of this chemical.          Commercial shampoos are made with sulfates because they act as an effective cleanser. They strip the hair of its natural oils to give it that "squeaky clean" quality. The problem is they make hair too clean, and it damages the hair. In fact, the same chemicals are used in dishwashing and laundry detergents. Health food stores and natural beauty product stores sell shampoos without sulfates. Look for a bottle labeled "sulfate-free" to be extra sure it doesn't contain the chemical. Some people with curly hair choose to forego using shampoo entirely. They find that their dry hair doesn't need to have its natural oils washed away, and water alone does the trick for washing out dirt.; , Since sulfates wash the oils away from out hair, conditioners resupply moisture and shine by adding silicones to the mix. The problem is that silicones build up in the hair over time and cause it to start looking dry and dull. Buy a new conditioner that doesn't contain silicones; you may see results the first time you use it.          Hair balms, creams, gels, and other products also often contain silicones. Examine all of your products and toss or donate the ones that have ingredients that could be harmful to your hair.  Trimming away the split ends and other damaged sections of hair can go a long way toward making it look and feel healthy again. Get rid of the damage caused by your old shampoo and conditioner products. It's time to start fresh with a new routine.  Now that you aren't putting sulfates and silicones in your hair, you don't need to wash it every day. In fact, washing your hair that often can really dry it out, increasing volume and frizz. To keep your hair manageable and healthy, wash it two or three times a week.  Have you been washing your hair with hot water for years and years? High temperatures can really do a number on hair that's already rough and dry; the hot water causes the hair shaft to get frayed. Instead, go as cold as you can stand. When your hair is dry, it'll look sleek and shiny.          If you hate taking cold showers (who doesn't) try washing your hair separately, in the sink. That way you can use ice-cold water without getting chilled.  Here's the routine you want to avoid: roughly toweling your hair, violently brushing out tangles, then blasting it with the hair dryer. Hair that is already dry does not respond well to this rough treatment. Instead, use the following routine to dry your hair:          Pat it dry with a soft towel. Don't wring it out or twist it up in the towel; gently squeeze out the excess water, then pat it dry. Apply leave-in conditioner or anti-frizz serum. Make sure it's free of silicones. Run some through your hair with your fingers while it's still damp, and use a wide-toothed comb to gently work out any tangles. Let your hair finish air drying. Put away the hair dryer and let it dry the natural way. It'll take longer, but after a few weeks your hair will regain its natural health and shine.  Blow drying, flat ironing and curling your hair every day, or even a few times a week, makes for a lot of long-term damage. Try to adopt a styling routine that makes the most of your air-dried hair.          When you do want to dry your hair, choose a cooler setting on the hair dryer and use a diffuser. If you want to curl your hair, try curling it without heat.  Getting your hair trimmed and shaped every few months will keep it looking fresh and healthy. Just make sure your stylist knows not to use shampoo and conditioner with sulfates or silicones, and ask her to use a cooler hair dryer setting and employ the diffuser when you're getting your hair styled.  If your hair is consistently dull and rough, you may not be getting the nutrients you need to keep it healthy.Incorporate more of the following foods into your diet:          Fish, avocados, and nuts that contain omega-3 fatty acids. These are essential to hair and nail health. Fruits and vegetables with vitamin E and A, such as spinach, kale, carrots, and sweet potatoes.  Dehydration is another cause of dull, dry hair. Drink at least 8 glasses of water a day to restore your hair's shine and vibrancy.         

use sulfate-free shampoo.  buy silicone-free conditioner and styling products.  get a trim.  wash your hair less often.  wash your hair with cold water.  dry your hair with care.  avoid using heat styling tools.  get regular trims.  eat nutrients that promote healthy hair.  drink plenty of water. 

 Determine whether you have oily skin, normal skin, or dry skin before purchasing an exfoliating product. Dry skin is often flaky or itchy, whereas oily skin can feel greasy or look shiny. Many people have a combination of the two types in different areas, in which case use products for normal skin or products for the type of skin you have most of.  If you have oily or normal skin choose a product that contains either benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. These ingredients can help to improve and prevent breakouts. You can also apply an alpha-hydroxy-acid cleanser, which helps remove dead skin cells. Use a product with retinoic acid to balance out skin tone and reduce wrinkles.   If you have dry skin, avoid using the above products and strong exfoliants that contain glycolic acid. Generally avoid any chemical products and opt for physical-based products that are less invasive. Stay away from products that have higher than 10% glycolic acid or 2% salicylic acid.If you are allergic to aspirin, you should not use any product containing salicylic acid.  If you have sensitive skin, look for products that are labeled as suitable for sensitive skin. Choose a product with smooth, synthetic exfoliating beads. These products are good for dry or easily irritated skin, too. If your skin is on the oily side, choose a product with coarse, rough beads that will exfoliate more aggressively.  Brands like Clarisonic have developed tools that can be used to remove the outer layer of dead or dry skin from your face. These brushes use sonic frequency to remove dirt and debris from your face without irritating your skin. Though not as effective as a professional microdermabrasion treatment, these tools are much less expensive. 

identify your skin type.  choose the right ingredients for your skin type.  choose beads for sensitive or dry skin.  try an electric exfoliating brush.

 These are small, high-powered kilns that are specifically designed to melt precious metals, including gold and silver. You can buy them online.   Some of these electric gold furnaces are pretty affordable. They also allow people to mix previous metals together (such as gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and so on) and melt them at home. To use them, you will need the same equipment, including a crucible and flux. If the gold item also contains small percentages of silver, copper or zinc, the melting point will be lower., You want to use a microwave that does not have the magnetron on the top but rather has it on the side or back.You can buy a microwave gold smelting kit or kiln. You place the kiln on a kiln shelf in the microwave. The crucible holds the gold while it is being heated and is placed in the kiln, with a lid on top.Don’t use the microwave for cooking food again if you have used it to melt gold, though. 

buy an electric furnace that is used for melting gold.  try melting down gold in a 1200-watt microwave. 

 Anyone can make this hackysack, even if you've never sewed before. The result is pretty sturdy if you use strong thread. One disadvantage is that sand – a great stuffing for beginners or people practicing tricks – will leak out the hole. Most players will still have plenty of fun with rice or lentil stuffing instead.; , Find a pair of old socks without holes or worn areas. Cut off the tip of each one, about 3–4 inches (7.5–10 cm) from the toes., Thread a needle with a long piece of strong thread. Pull it through both sides of the sock, near the hole. Continue sewing by moving the needle back through the sock again in the other direction. Repeat this back-and-forth movement until the sock is sewn mostly shut. Leave a gap for stuffing the sock.   Polyester thread is cheap and strong, making it a good choice for this project.The closer together your thread lines, the less your hacky sack will leak stuffing.  Stick a funnel in the hole, or a rolled-up paper cone. Fill the sock with stuffing material. Uncooked rice or lentils are cheap and large enough that they won't fall out much. Plastic pellets or steel pellets from a hobby store will give more control, and feel more like commercial hacky sacks.Sand and birdseed tends to leak out of this style hacky sack.  Finish sewing the hole shut once the sock is filled. Tie the thread into a knot and snip off the excess.  For extra protection, pull the second piece of sock over the first. Sew it shut just as you did the first one. Align this sock so the two holes are on opposite ends, reducing the chance of material leaking out.  

use this for an easy, but sturdy hacky sack.  cut an old sock.  sew one piece most of the way closed.  pour in rice or other material.  sew the sock closed.  sew the second sock over the first. 

 You may be able to disconnect the ends (the part that connects to the phone, and the part that connects to the headset) for easier detangling.; , Make sure to do this in order.

 Positive affirmations are when you say something nice about yourself. The goal of affirmations is to change your thinking so that you see yourself in a more positive light.Teaching your child how to use positive affirmations can be a great way to help them think more positively about themselves.  Try teaching your child to say things like, “I love my curly hair!” or “I am looking so cool in my new outfit!” Affirmations should always be in the first person (using "I"). Model positive affirmations for your child as well. Allow your child to see and hear you saying nice things to yourself to provide them with a model for positive self-talk. Have your child stand in front of a mirror when they use positive affirmations and make sure that you model this behavior for your child as well. Encourage your child to use an affirmation every day, such as while they are getting ready in the morning or before heading off to school.  To help support your child’s body image, you should set an example by making healthy choices for your family. Model healthy eating and include physical activity into your life. This helps create healthy habits that lead to a healthy body image.   Encourage your child to choose healthy foods and activities for the family. This helps them be an active part of the family’s healthy living. For example, cook balanced meals with multiple vegetables, healthy grains, and lean cuts of meat. Set aside time each week for physical activity. Go for hikes or bike rides on the weekend together, and ask your child to choose physical activities they want to do with the family.  If you are talking negatively about yourself or others, you are not supporting a healthy body image for yourself or your child. Watch what you say around your child so you don’t inadvertently teach them negative habits or bad body image patterns.Talk about yourself in positive terms. Refrain from things like, “I’m so fat” or “I hate everything about myself.” Don’t talk negatively about others, either. Avoid saying, “She’s let herself go” or “She looks so fat.”  , You can support your child’s body image by using positive language and eliminating certain language from your home. When you talk about other people, don’t use words like “fat” or “skinny,” which can lead to issues with your child’s body image. Focus on healthy instead of skinny, fat, or diets.Talking about people based on their size or looks just teaches your child that looks are the most important thing about a person. It also teaches them to do the same thing to other people and themselves.  Your children will feel more positive about their bodies if they are involved in making the choices. This helps give them some control over their nutrition and teaches them how to make their own healthy choices later.   Take your child with you to the grocery store. Encourage them to choose vegetables, fruits, healthy grains, and lean cuts of meat they like. Remind your child that they don't have to like every vegetable and fruit. Try new things together to find vegetables and fruits you both like.  

teach your child how to use positive affirmations.  prioritize positive, healthy living in your family.  avoid negative self-talk around your child.  modify the language you use at home.  include your children in healthy eating choices. 

 You can store it in either the bottle that it's pumped into or in another container designed for breast milk storage. Make sure to label the containers and use the oldest milk first., If you have extra breast milk, you can freeze it in plastic containers designed for breast milk storage. Fill the containers 3/4 full to allow room for the milk to expand. Label the containers and be sure to use the milk within three or four months.   Don't freeze milk in bags that are not designed for this specific purpose. Certain plastics can leach chemicals into the milk. Disposable bottle bags are too flimsy. When you're ready to use the milk, thaw it in the refrigerator first. Don't thaw it at room temperature. Don't add fresh milk to a container of frozen milk.  Rather than storing a big jar of milk, store it in small serving-sized containers in portions of 2 - 4 ounces, depending on how much your baby usually takes. 

store milk in the refrigerator for up to three days.  freeze milk for a few months.  store milk in convenient serving sizes. 

 This is the ideal route to take if you paid a professional to apply window tinting and the tint job is still under warranty.; ,   Heat the bubbled area with a hair dryer to soften the film adhesive. Use a credit card or small squeegee to press out the bubbles.    Make a solution out of dish soap and water. Wash the back of the peeling film with the soap and water solution. Use a squeegee to smooth the film back over the window. Allow the film to dry thoroughly.    Cut heavy black garbage bag to the size of your window. If 1 bag is not large enough to cover your window, you may use more than 1 bag. Wet the outside of the window you are fixing and place the black bag against the window. The bag should cover the entire window and the water should keep it in place. Cover the entire back seat and the inside, under-window deck with a tarp. Spray the entirety of the inside window surface (the tinted side) liberally with ammonia. Park the car in the sun, allowing for the window to heat up under the black garbage back, and leave it sitting for about an hour. Starting in a corner without a defroster line, use a razor blade to peel back the film. Spray ammonia to the film as needed to keep it damp and to keep the film's adhesive from drying again. The entire film should come off in 1 piece. If you have a steamer, you may skip the ammonia-soaking process and use the steamer to heat the tinted window and remove the film in the same way.  

seek the help of a professional.  press out the bubbles.  re-adhere peeling parts.  remove the tinting job.

 If you have oily skin, you may be more susceptible to ending up with orange looking foundation. This is because the oils in your skin can interact with the foundation and change the shade. You can counteract excess oil on your skin by using a mattifying primer on your face before you apply foundation.         Use a clean makeup brush to apply the mattifying primer on clean, exfoliated skin. This will ensure your foundation goes on smooth and is less likely to change shades.  It is also important that you let each product you use dry well on your face before layering or adding more product to it. Having excess moisture on your face can cause your skin to react with your foundation and lead to a change in the foundation shade.Once you apply a makeup primer or a face moisturizer, let the product dry. Use your fingers to lightly touch your face to make sure the product has dried before you apply any foundation. You can also use blotting paper or a clean tissue to lightly dab away any excess moisture on your face, particularly on your T-zone area. This would be your forehead, your nose, and your chin.  Always apply your foundation properly and evenly so it appears fresh and clean on your face. Dabbing the foundation on with clean fingertips or using a clean makeup brush to stipple on the foundation will ensure it dries properly. It can also help to reduce the likelihood of the foundation appearing cakey, thick, or orange.         Try to apply one even layer of the foundation by dabbing or stippling it onto your skin. Blend the foundation in with clean fingers or a clean makeup sponge. Never sweep, rub, or smear on the foundation.  You can try using a setting powder to help keep your foundation looking fresh and to avoid an orange tinge later on. Look for a setting powder that is the same brand as your foundation, as this will ensure the two products will react well with each other. Using a setting powder made by a different brand can lead to a negative reaction on your skin and oxidization, which can lead to an orange look.         Check that your foundation is dry before you apply setting powder. Use a clean makeup brush to apply the setting powder and make sure the setting powder sits on your skin in one, even layer.  

use a mattifying primer.  make sure your face is dry before you apply foundation.  dab on the foundation.  go for a setting powder that matches your foundation. 

 Depending on the version you’re playing, you can get the Boomerang as a reward by completing certain missions.   In “Oracle of Ages,” you can get the Boomerang by winning at the Goron Shooting Gallery found in Lynna Village. All you need to do is to simply hit all the balls thrown at Link.; , Boomerangs can also be found inside treasure chests.   In “Ocarina of Time,” you can find the Boomerang locked inside a big treasure chest inside Lord Jabu-Jabu’s Belly—the third dungeon in the main storyline. In “A Link to the Past,” you may also find a Boomerang kept in a chest inside the house of the Sweeping Lady found in Kakariko Village.

 Look for individually packaged snacks that are nutritious. Or you can purchase large quantities of food and divide it into smaller portions that you can take on the go. Good snack ideas that are easy to transport include:Peanut butter and cut vegetables Nuts and seeds Yogurt cups String cheese Fruit Hummus and whole-grain crackers  , A sandwich is classic on-the-go food. You can quickly make a healthy sandwich the night before you need it and store it in the fridge overnight. Or buy a sandwich that you can customize. This will give you the chance to make nutritious improvements.Keep in mind that you should avoid eating lunch or deli meat during pregnancy. Make classic nut and seed butter sandwiches with jam, veggie sandwiches, or egg salad sandwiches. For example, substitute whole-grain bread for white bread. Add fresh vegetables and choose low-fat cheese.  If you'll be stuck at a desk or in a meeting where you can't easily eat or snack, pack some soup in a thermos. You'll be able to discreetly sip a nutritious meal that will also fill you up. Try to choose low-sodium soups or soups with lots of vegetables and lean proteins. You can quickly drink:Cream of broccoli soup Tomato soup Chili Gazpacho  , For example, instead of grabbing a coffee and doughnut as you walk out the door, drink low-fat milk and eat a whole-grain fruit muffin.

stock up on healthy snacks.  pack or choose a nutritious sandwich.  eat or drink a healthy soup.  select healthier options with a little protein.  purchase lightly processed foods. 

 For the salad, you’ll need 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts that have already been cooked. Use a sharp knife to chop the chicken into ½-inch (1.27-cm) cubes, and set aside for the moment.If you don’t have leftover chicken breasts, you can use store-bought rotisserie chicken, remove the meat from the bone, and chop it into pieces.; , Place 1 ripe avocado that’s been seeded and peeled into a large bowl. Use a fork to mash the avocado until it is mostly smooth.It’s important to work quickly as you mash the avocado and begin to mix the salad. Avocado can brown very quickly.  Once you’ve mashed the avocado, add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of lime juice to the bowl. Use the fork to stir the juice into the avocado until they are well blended.Adding the lime juice helps keep the avocado from browning because the acid in the juice helps lower the avocado’s pH.  After you’ve combined the avocado and lime juice, add half a small onion that’s been chopped, 8 grape tomatoes that have been sliced in half, and the diced chicken to the bowl. Use the fork to toss all of the ingredients together so they’re lightly coated with the avocado mixture.If there are other vegetables that you’d like to add to the salad, such as chopped celery, mix them in with onion and tomatoes.  When the salad is fully mixed, add as much salt as you like to season it. You can eat the avocado chicken salad straight from the bowl or use it as a filling for sandwiches.Store any leftover salad in the refrigerator in an airtight container. It should keep for 1 to 2 days.  

cut the chicken breasts into pieces.  mash the avocado.  mix in the lime juice.  stir in the tomatoes, onions, and chicken.  season the salad with salt and serve. 

 To qualify for UI benefits in California, you must have lost your last job through no fault of your own.This means that if you quit your last job for unacceptable reasons or were fired with cause, you may not be eligible to receive UI benefits.Acceptable reasons for quitting or losing your job include: layoffs, downsizing, or quitting because of harassment or significant medical reasons.Unacceptable reasons for quitting or losing your job include: quitting because you didn't like your job, quitting to change careers, or getting fired because of serious and repeated lapses in judgment or performance.With that said, your past employer's definition of bad performance or lapses in judgment may be different from the California Employment Development Department's (EDD's) definition of those things.

The Continued Claim Form includes questions regarding whether you were able to work; whether you looked for work; whether you did in fact work work; and finally, the form asks you to complete a work search record, which asks you to report the jobs you applied for.If you have concerns about how you should answer certain questions on the Continued Claim Form, you can follow this guide. It provides step-by-step instructions on how to answer each question on the form.  If you find work while you are receiving UI benefits, you are required to disclose that information on your biweekly Continued Claim Form.Whether you receive money for your services or not, you still must disclose the number of hours you worked, who you worked for, how much money you made, and whether you are still working there.Failing to report this information can result in UI fraud, which may subject you to severe punishment.Be sure you look here for information on how to correctly report any income you receive.  UI benefits normally last for one year.If you have received one year of UI benefits and are still unemployed and otherwise eligible for normal UI benefits, you may be able to receive a federal extension on your UI benefits.If you are eligible, EDD will automatically file your first extension and they will simply continue to send you your Continued Claim Form every other week.If you need to file more than one extension, EDD will again automatically do so for you and continue to send you your Continued Claim Forms., Many people who are rightfully eligible for UI benefits are denied them. If you suspect you were wrongfully denied, EDD has an appeals process. Review your Notice of Determination, which will lay out the reasons you were denied UI benefits, and, if you believe they wrongly denied your UI application, you can request an appeal.   The most common reason for being denied UI benefits is not meeting the minimum eligibility requirements (discussed in Part 1). For example, EDD may determine that you lost your job as a result of performance issues or because you quit voluntarily. These determinations are often made by EDD after interviewing your past employers. The most common denials that are appealed involve voluntary quits and misconduct.If you are denied UI benefits because you quit your job, be prepared to prove that you quit with good cause (i.e., you had a real and compelling reason to quit).If you are denied UI benefits because of alleged misconduct, your employer will have the burden of proving that misconduct on appeal.This is good news for you; it is often possible to win an appeal based on alleged misconduct because your employer may not have the necessary evidence to prove it., If you disagree with EDD's reasons for denying your UI benefits, you must submit your appeal within 20 calendar days of the date on your EDD Notice of Determination.Keep your appeal simple and only state you wish to appeal the decision (e.g., "I disagree with the decision by EDD and I am entitled to UI benefits under the law").Saying anything else may actually hurt your chances of winning an appeal.You can choose to either submit an appeal form or an appeal letter. The appeal form can be found here. When the form is completed, simply send it in with a copy of your Notice of Determination. If you are writing an appeal letter, simply state that you are appealing and send it to the address designated in your Notice of Determination.Make sure you include your name, address, phone number, and social security number., After submitting your appeal, EDD will send you a notice acknowledging your appeal as well as a notice of a hearing.At the hearing you will be able to present the reasons why your UI claim should be granted and, depending on the reason for the denial, your employer will have an opportunity to attend the hearing and present evidence as well.Review the appeal file.The appeal file is available at the Office of Appeals (at an address that will be provided to you in a letter) and you need to retrieve a copy to analyze before the hearing.The file will contain claim notes, employer protests, records of interviews, your Notice of Determination, and the appeal letter.Learn the basics of the law that applies to your appeal.You should understand the basic law that will govern your appeal. Look through this guide, which should provide you with the basic information you need.  Gather supporting documents.In addition to the documentation in your appeal file, you should also be prepared to introduce other evidence at the hearing.Some of the evidence you should try to bring includes performance reviews, personnel manuals, employee commendations and/or reprimands, and any written correspondence between you and your past employer.Consider contacting an attorney to help you with your appeal. You are allowed to bring a representative with you to the appeals hearing and you may want to hire an attorney for that reason. An attorney can help you navigate the process and present a persuasive case on your behalf. Consider contacting your local legal services organization since they often deal with these types of issues. If you are in San Francisco, try contacting the Legal Aid Society Employment Law Center.  Your UI appeal hearing will either be conducted in person or in some limited circumstances it will be conducted via telephone.An administrative law judge or representative from your state unemployment insurance agency will conduct the hearing.At the hearing, the administrative law judge will make introductory remarks and will turn on a recording device in order to make a record of the proceedings.In addition, the administrative law judge will give you an overview of the hearing process.After the preliminary remarks, the agency representative will ask you questions related to your UI claim and through this process you will have an opportunity to share why you are entitled to UI benefits and present evidence.If your employer attends, they will also have an opportunity ask you questions related to your UI claim., After your hearing, your state agency will send you a decision.The hearing officer will state the facts of your case as well as the basis for their decision.If you disagree with the decision you can appeal again.If you wish to appeal, you have 20 days to file an additional appeal.

 Choose a color for your flowers that matches another item on the coffee table to accentuate that color. Alternatively, choose a color that matches or contrasts with a major color in your room’s decorating scheme. For example, if you have yellow wainscotting, display yellow flowers. Flowers also allow you to add color to your room.For example, use dark red flowers to match coffee table books with dark red dust jackets. Brighten up a dark room with white flowers.  Choose a vase that reflects the style you are trying to convey. Pick an artistic or elegant vase as the centerpiece for your coffee table. Don’t limit yourself to traditional vases. Antique pitchers and other attractive containers that will hold water and flowers can serve as a vase.For example, put flowers with large, single bloom flowers in old mason jars for a rustic look. For a nautical theme, fill an old hurricane lamp with flowers.  Choose flowers that won’t be dwarfed by a large vase. If you have a vase that can only hold a few stems, keep your floral arrangement simple. Keep taller vases to the sides of the coffee table so that people can see each other if they are seated across your coffee table and so they don’t obstruct the view of the television isn’t obstructed. Alternatively, use shorter flowers and vases in the center of the table., Add a green, living element to your coffee table with a houseplant. Put the plants in nice planters that complement your decor. Choose succulents for a very low-maintenance alternative to houseplants. Use a terrarium or glass bowls to best display and show off succulents. 

pick flowers in one color.  make a statement with your vase.  find the right size and number of flowers.  choose an alternative to flowers. 

 Remove all furniture and other items from the carpet you need to stretch. If you leave items on the carpet, they will weigh it down, preventing it from stretching properly. Then, thoroughly vacuum it before starting the stretching process. This will reduce the amount of dust you have to deal with.; , Your carpet will be held in place by tack strips located near the edges. Starting in one corner, slowly pull on the carpet to ease it away from the tacks. If it doesn’t come up easily, try grabbing the corner of the carpet with a pair of pliers and then gently tugging it away from the tack strip. Once you get started, it should pull away like a zipper.Don’t pull the carpet up on all sides of the room. It needs to remain anchored along at least one wall. Don’t pull too hard, as this could separate the fibers and damage the carpet. If you’re having serious trouble getting the carpet up, contact a professional.  There will be a layer of soft padding underneath the carpet you just pulled up. Examine the padding. If it is held down by any staples or tacks, pry those out with pliers and a flat-head screwdriver. Lift it back from the edges of the walls as well to allow space for you to work with the tack strips.  Use a strong flat-head screwdriver, the claw of a hammer or a pry bar. Wedge your tool underneath the old tack strips and pry them up and out.Wear work gloves while handling old and new tack strips as they are made of setting nails on one side and razor-sharp tacks on the other. It’s also a good idea to wear protective eye wear to keep you from being injured by flying splinters or tacks. Place old pieces of tack strip in a bucket or cardboard box near you. This will keep your work area clear of these sharp objects to prevent you from putting a knee or hand down on the exposed nails.  Once the carpet and padding are peeled away, your base flooring will be exposed, and is probably dirty. There might also be splinters or loose staples from pulling up the materials. Go over the floor with a shop vacuum to remove this debris., Set the new tack strips about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the wall where you pulled up the old ones, using a pair of tin snips to cut them in lengths to fit. Lay them so that the gripping nails on top (the sharp nails that'll hold the carpet in place) are pointed toward the wall. Place a chisel or pry bar on top of the setting nails (those pointed down to the floor) and hammer them to sink them into the floor.You should be able to find tack strips at a flooring supply or hardware store, if you haven’t already purchased them. Measure out the perimeter of the area you will be carpeting. It’s a good idea to buy enough tack strips to have a little bit more than the perimeter length, just in case there’s a problem and you need extras.  Lay the carpet padding back down over the newly-installed tack strip. You can trim it along the tack strip with a utility knife, or wait to use a carpet cutter that you will rent with other tools from a hardware store. Finally, staple the padding to the floor about every three inches next to the tack strip and along all seams where one piece ends and another begins.   Cut diagonally at corners of the room and around door frames so it'll fall into place when you trim off the excess. If the area you are working with is large enough that you need multiple pieces of padding, you can also use duct tape to secure the seams between them., You’ll need to visit a home improvement store to get these, but hold off on renting this equipment until you have the new tack strips in place. You will usually rent the tools by the hour or by the day, so you want to make sure that your floor is prepared and you are ready to use them as soon as you get home. Talk to the store staff if you have questions. You will need just a few tools:A power stretcher provides a lot of the muscle. It "bites" into the carpet with sharp prongs on one end and has a brace that fits against the opposite wall, allowing you to stretch the carpet in the largest areas of the room. This tool comes with extenders to allow you to adjust the stretching shaft to fit the length of the room. A knee kicker can help you stretch the carpet in smaller areas that can't accommodate a power stretcher. It also comes in handy for doing the last bit of stretching after using the power stretcher. A carpet cutter will make the job of cutting excess carpet much easier than trying to use a utility knife.  Trim the padding with a carpet cutter if you haven’t already done so with a utility knife. Then, lay down the carpet over the padding. Set the power stretcher down over the part of the carpet you are working with and want stretched.   If you are installing new carpet instead of just stretching existing carpet, measure it out and cut it ahead of time to make it easier to lay down.  Place the base of the stretcher against the wall the carpet is anchored to. Lengthen the adjustment rod of the power stretcher until its head is about 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the carpet's un-anchored edge. Press down on the lever of the power stretcher to smooth out the carpet wrinkles.If the lever requires too much pressure to push down, you're stretching the carpet too tight. Likewise, if it takes almost no effort to push the lever down, you aren't stretching it tight enough.  If you are trying to stretch carpet in a part of a room where the power stretcher is too big to fit, you’ll want to use the knee kicker. This tool also comes in handy for going back over the carpet after the power stretcher has done the bulk of the work, to give any trouble spots some extra care. To use the knee kicker, place its head about 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the wall and use your leg (just above the kneecap) to finish the stretch.  Push the edges of the stretched carpet down into the tack strips. The carpet should also push down slightly (be embedded) in the space between the tack strips and the wall. Then, use the carpet cutter to remove any excess that is butting up against the wall.If you are using a utility knife, cut very slowly and cautiously so you don't over-trim.  If you are stretching carpet over or through doorways, you’ll need to pick up some additional materials at the hardware or flooring supply store. Look for transition molding that can be nailed in place over the carpet in the doorway. This will help hold the carpet in the high-traction area.If you have questions about how to select or install transition molding, ask the staff at the hardware or flooring supply store for more information.  

clear the carpet.  peel the old carpet back.  pull out staples or tacks from the pad before lifting it from the floor.  remove the old tack strips.  clean the floor.  put new tack strips into place.  reset the pad.  rent carpet tools.  lay the carpet down.  use the power stretcher to pull the carpet into place.  grab the knee kicker to finish the stretching.  trim the excess carpet.  secure the carpet at doorways. 

 The military offers undergraduate educational opportunities to the most determined and hard working high school students. Most programs offer a large grant or scholarship to the accepted students. Service academy offers full four year scholarship and require five years commitment to the service after graduation.You'll graduate with a Bachelor of Science's degree and enter the force as either a second lieutenant or ensign.; , Most programs will require you to be above and beyond the “average” high school student. These programs are extremely competitive and you’ll need to do everything in your power to stand out. Here is a list of requirements:   An above average GPA (3.5 and usually higher) Higher range SAT/ACT test scores Participation in extracurricular activities and athletics Leadership and experience in your community involvement A congressional letter of recommendation (not required for Coast Guard), Increase your chances and understanding of what is in store for you. By participating in JROTC, you’ll have a wider understanding of the type of training you’ll encounter in an academy. This is also a great way to decide if officer training and the military are right for you.  Before entering into a program, you’ll need to decide which branch of the military suits you best. This could be a good time to reach out to a recruitment officer and talk about your options.  This is the highest caliber of academy to become an officer. The application should be started in your junior year of high school. Go to the website of the prospective institution and create an application online. During your junior year, you should apply for a congressional nomination. Once this is finished you can complete your application based on the academy.There are five service academies:   U.S. Military Academy (Army) U.S. Naval Academy (Navy/Marine Corps) U.S. Air Force Academy (Air Force) U.S. Coast Guard Academy (Coast Guard) U.S. Merchant Marine Academy 

understand service academies.  excel in high school academics.  participate in jrotc.  decide what your interests in the military are.  apply to a service academy. 

 Are you bothered by a lack of social skills? Do you struggle with superficial conversations, showing your feelings, experience frequent awkward pauses in conversations, or other practical problems? Perhaps you manage to come across sociable enough, but still wish you didn't always feel so uncomfortable and insecure.   Also ask yourself how much you really want to change – not everyone is or can be a social butterfly. Don't waste efforts comparing yourself to others. Don't tell yourself that you should be like them. This is simply negative reinforcement, which will only make you feel like you are different, alone, and, in extreme cases, even inferior.; , Socially anxious individuals frequently have a stream of negative thoughts running through their heads. "I look awkward," "No one is talking to me," or "I am going to look like an idiot," are all thoughts that may run on a loop. As you can probably tell, these thoughts are all negative and will only serve to keep you feeling shy and self-conscious.   Aim to break the habit of negative thoughts by becoming aware of when you are falling prey to them and by challenging their logic. For example, just because you are nervous in a crowd or at a party does not mean you look awkward. Others around you may be getting a case of nerves, too. Reframing means not just taking a positive spin on your thoughts, but also a more realistic perspective. Many negative thoughts are rooted in irrational beliefs. Find evidence that disputes your negative thoughts and find another way of looking at the situation., This is one of the most important aspects of shyness and social anxiety. Most shy people don't do this on purpose, but often, attention is consistently drawn to yourself during conversations. This makes you self-aware and keeps a vicious cycle rotating. Research has shown this may play a key role in why people might experience panic attacks after relatively mild anxious moments.Rather than noticing that you are being shy, or that you may have said something embarrassing, try to take a light-hearted approach to perceived deficits. Laugh it off or carry on without bringing too much attention to what you believe is a flaw. Most people will empathize – feeling connected as a human is easier than you might think. Show interest in other people and/or the surroundings. You may feel like everyone is watching you, but generally, people are not judging you. Distorted perception is the culprit in this situation. Others are busy doing their own thing, and, in most cases, are not out to get you. A common misconception is that shy people are introverts. Introverts, in fact, enjoy solitude and recharge by spending time alone. On the contrary, people who are shy desperately want to engage with others but fear scrutiny or judgement., Imitation is the highest form of flattery. Of course, you shouldn't go and do exactly what you see another person do, but watching someone who is socially adept can give you some ideas on how to handle certain situations.  If you know these individuals well enough, you can even be candid with them and outright ask for advice. Let them know that you notice they seem to be very comfortable in social settings and see if they can give you any pointers. You might just get a surprise and find out that one of the people you admire for their social abilities is actually just as shy as you.  Sometimes, extreme shyness is a sign of social anxiety disorder. Individuals with this disorder are terribly fearful of being scrutinized or judged by others to the point that they have little or no friendships or romantic relationships.Your mental health provider can help you to diagnose social anxiety disorder and work with you to develop healthier thought patterns and the confidence to stop avoiding people and social situations.  Would you approach somebody with a sour expression on their face or with their head down on their desk? Not likely. Our body language can allow others to make assumptions about us before we even speak. Refrain from looking down at your shoes and try for a small, confident smile and eye contact instead.   Open body language sends a message to others that you are willing to interact with them. Sit leaning forward in the direction of the person you are talking to, keep your legs and arms open, and maintain a relaxed posture. Recognize that your body language not only determines how people perceive you but also how you perform. Research shows that certain power poses – like a relaxed posture and open arms – depict when a person is feeling in charge and victorious. On the other hand, closing in on oneself like in the fetal position depict helplessness or vulnerability. One popular Ted Talk shows how these positions of dominance and power are universal throughout all living things – human, primates, even birds. The speaker's premise is, if we purposefully go into these "power" positions when we are feeling insecure, we begin to believe it. This means that you have the power to control your confidence level in any given situation.Striking a power pose for two to five minutes can actually alter your brain chemistry, increasing testosterone and decreasing stress hormones. Even simply visualizing these poses can make you feel more confident and help you begin taking risks.  The best way to meet people is to actively seek out places where you can meet people. Go to the Fall Dance party at your school or the office Christmas get-together. Try to meet at least one person by the end of the night. Find the local Open Mic & read some poetry you wrote in your college days.   One researcher said the best outlet for him to overcome shyness around people was to get a job at a fast food restaurant. Working at McDonald's during his adolescence forced him to interact with complete strangers on a daily basis. He is still self-conscious in some social situations, but he credits that experience with helping him to become more successful despite his shyness.Ask friends of yours to introduce you to some of their friends or acquaintances. This is a great way to meet new people. Plus, you don't have to worry about knowing everyone because the one person you know will act as a buffer. Talk to this person for awhile and then slowly branch out and strike up conversations with mutual friends.  Even though this may sound strange, stand in front of a mirror or close your eyes; imagine yourself talking to someone. Feeling like you are prepared before you enter into an unfamiliar social setting can help you minimize anxiety. See your interactions as more like role-play in a movie. Imagine yourself as the gregarious person that draws in others. Then, get out there and put your practice to work.  Amplifying your strengths will not only make you feel more confident when around others, but will also make you seem more interesting and inviting. For example, if you like art, consider painting sets for a play. It will be easier to shine if you feel comfortable. Find ways to engage with others that share the same passions or interests as you. You can attract many new friends simply by doing what you know and seeming to enjoy it.  No need to be over the top. Some of the greatest conversations started with "I like your shirt. Did you get it at (store name)?" Compliments naturally give others a positive impression of you because you made them feel good. What's more, you are guaranteed to walk away with a smile because complimenting others makes you feel good, too.If you know the person, use their name when you give a compliment. Also, be specific. Don't just say "You look great" say "I like your new hairstyle. The color is really flattering with your skin tone". Strive to give three to five compliments a day to a variety of people that you meet on the street and in your daily activities. Try not to select the same person twice. See how many conversations get started and how many people you leave feeling better than when you met them.  Try to make progress in small, easily broken down, and identifiable steps. This gives you something new to learn every time, and you can proudly keep track of progress. Keep doing things like having conversations with new people and seeking out opportunities to connect with others. And, celebrate small wins, whether it is giving a few compliments or challenging your negative thoughts.  

consider what you want to change and why.  reframe your thinking.  focus your attention outward, not on yourself.  observe how others with confidence navigate the social scene.  see a mental health professional if you have trouble overcoming shyness on your own.  be approachable.  put yourself out there.  practice talking.  showcase your talents.  give sincere compliments.  take small steps. 

 Most items will usually defrost within up to 24 hours; however, large items such as frozen turkeys and chickens may take several days to defrost.   Place frozen items that weigh approximately 1 lb. (0.45 kg) into the refrigerator the day before you plan to cook them. Calculate the amount of days needed to defrost large items such as hams or turkeys, allowing 24 hours for every 5 lbs. (2.26 kg). For example, to defrost a turkey that weighs 16 lbs. (7.25 kg), place the turkey in the refrigerator at least 3 days prior to cooking it.; , Your food will take longer to defrost if the temperature of your refrigerator is several degrees lower.  Any juice that drips from your defrosted food onto other food in your refrigerator may contaminate those foods.  Some foods must be prepared and eaten immediately to prevent bacteria growth; however, you may refreeze the food, as long as it is placed in the freezer within the time frame in which you should have eaten it.   Eat ground meats, seafood, and poultry within 1 and 2 days after they have been defrosted. Eat lamb, pork, beef, steak, roast, and all other types of meats within 3 and 5 days after they have been defrosted.  

determine when to defrost your food in the refrigerator.  verify that the temperature of your refrigerator is set to 40 degrees fahrenheit (4.44 degrees celsius).  place your frozen food on a plate or dish to prevent leaks.  prepare your food shortly after it has been defrosted. 

 Use a comb to gather your hair on top of your head and secure it with a hairband. Make sure the sides, back and top are bump-free and the hairband is nice and tight, so your bun will stay in place.Ballerina buns are usually positioned right on top of the head, but you could just as easily position your bun further back on your head. Just make sure it's securely in place. If you have a few strands of hair that won't fit in the hairband, pin them up using bobby pins.  This will add some volume and make your bun appear bigger, so it looks like you have long, thick hair. To tease, lift your ponytail up straight. Insert a comb near the tips and comb back toward the roots. Repeat until your entire ponytail has been teased.          You can skip this step if you prefer a sleek, smooth bun. Just keep in mind it will be smaller than the average ballerina bun, since your hair is on the shorter side.  Just use your hands to pull your ponytail apart so that it resembles a fishtail. Make sure each section is the same width.  Twist the section as you wrap to create a pretty twirled effect. Wrap it close to your hairband up against your head. Use several bobby pins to secure the ends in place. This is the first half of your ballerina bun.  Twist the section as you wrap and tuck it close to your head around the exposed part of the hairband. Tuck in the ends and pin them in place with several bobby pins.  Check your hair in the mirror to see if it has the right appearance, and use pins to tuck in any loose ends. Finish the look with firm-hold hairspray to hold your bun in place.         

gather your hair into a high ponytail.  tease your ponytail.  divide the ponytail into two sections.  wrap one section around your hairband and pin it down.  wrap the second section around your hairband and pin it down.  tuck in loose ends. 

 This method will work best for vehicles with a vertical manual lock—meaning a lock that you pull up to unlock or push down to lock. These locks are usually at the top of the door panel just inside the window. This method requires a thin but rigid tool that you can feed between the weatherstripping around the bottom of the window and the glass itself. A wire coat hanger works well, but you must straighten it first.A universal unlock tool or a “slim jim” also work in this case if you’re prone to locking your keys in your car and want to keep one around for future occurrences.; , Though the hanger mostly needs to be straight, you will need to keep a hook bent into one end. This hook will need to catch on the lever arm of the locking mechanism inside the car door.          The hook should be roughly two or three inches long., In order to reach the locking mechanism lever in the door, you must feed the hook end of the hanger into the small space between the bottom of the window and the weatherstripping the helps seal and cushion the window in the door.         You will need to feed the hanger down several inches, and you will feel when the end of the hook slips down past the window.  The mechanism lever will run parallel to the car door, so you’ll need to turn the hanger close to 90 degrees to make sure the hook faces perpendicular to the lever and can catch it.  This part is not an exact science and depends on the specific car. You will have to fish the hook around inside the workings of the door to find the lever.          The lever will likely be slightly behind the actual lock placement, so use the hanger within a few inches of the manual lock tab instead of directly next to it.You will see the manual lock lever shake and jiggle when you make contact with the lever arm, so keep fishing around until you see it start to move., Once you feel that the hook in the hanger is around the lever arm and you see the manual lock moving, then you simply need to jiggle and lift up on the hook to finish unlocking the door.         Since the lever arm is stronger than the hanger, it may bend your hook out of place. Pull the hanger out, reshape the hook, and reinsert to at the same spot. It may take several tries, but as long as you see the manual lock jiggling, then you know you’re in the right spot.  If you cannot seem to get any leverage by going beneath the window, you can always try one of the other methods, or you can simply call a locksmith. With the professional assortment of tools a locksmith will have available, they’ll have you back in your car within minutes.  

straighten a wire hanger.  bend a hook into one end of the hanger.  feed the hanger down between the window and the weatherstripping.  turn the hanger to point the hook toward the inside of the car.  fish the hook around to find the lever.  lift up on the lever arm.  call a locksmith. 

 Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the anal canal that can be present either outside or inside the body. They form when too much pressure on on the veins causes them to swell.This can happen when you strain while having a bowel movement, during pregnancy, or as a result of being overweight. Hemorrhoids are a common condition that can often be resolved with home treatment, including witch hazel. Symptoms include the following:Itching, irritation or pain in the anal area. Bleeding when you have a bowel movement (the blood will be bright red). A swelling or lump in the anal area. Check with your doctor before trying home treatment if you are unsure whether your symptoms are the result of hemorrhoids.; , Bathe or shower daily to keep your anal area clean. Baths are preferable to showers because it allows the area to sit in warm water for longer. You don't need to use soap, but use warm to hot water. Be gentle when cleaning your anal area, as scrubbing harder can cause irritation., After drying off the rest of your body, use a hair dryer to dry off your anal area. Rubbing with a towel can make the problem worse., Use a clean piece of cloth. Soak it in a witch hazel-alcohol extract. Blot it gently on the affected area. You can hold it on for a few minutes.If you prefer, you can use pre-made witch hazel pads, made specifically for use with hemorrhoids.This application is best for external hemorrhoids, as it only reaches the outer part of your anus. Internal hemorrhoids are ones that remain inside your anal cavity, while external ones bulge out past your sphincter., Once you remove the cloth, let the area air dry for a few minutes before putting your clothes back on.  

determine whether you have hemorrhoids.  clean your anal area.  don't use a towel.  apply witch hazel.  let the area air dry for a few minutes. 

   For carrots or radishes, measure 1 inch from the top of the vegetable down, and then cut it. For scallions or leeks, measure 3 inches from the roots up and cut.  Share container space, so if there is room without the vegetables touching place them in the same container.    When the carrot or radish grows roots, wait 1 more day before planting it in soil. When the scallion or leek has lots of roots and they are about 3 inches long, plant it.  You can't grow a carrot or radish/turnip etc. but you can regrow the greens for decorations, salads, or a beautiful houseplant.  

cut your vegetables.  fill a container with water and place the vegetable in.  plant the vegetables.  wait for growth. 

 When you go to an Indian restaurant there are a variety of different dishes that all use the same basic ingredients and technique used in curries. The difference is primarily in thickening agent used:    Korma uses a creamy agent, like coconut milk, yogurt, or cream.  Saag uses greens, usually spinach but sometimes mustard/collard greens.  Madras uses pureed and diced tomato  Vindaloo uses pureed chilies., This technique, used in many restaurants, creates a curry paste of onions, garlic, ginger, and spices, which cooks faster and results in a smoother curry. To make it, use a food processor to grind everything up into a thick paste, then add it to the hot oil after the seeds have crackled., There is no one "curry" recipe out there. Curry is about mixing and matching ingredients using curry cooking technique, as outlined above. Still, to make the most basic, run-of-the-mill curry you would add and cook, in this order:   3 tablespoons vegetable oil or ghee (clarified butter) 1/2teaspoon ground cumin seed 1/2teaspoon ground coriander seed 1 medium onion - finely chopped 4 cloves garlic - peeled and sliced 1.5-inch piece ginger - peeled and thinly sliced 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder, curry powder, salt 2 mild fleshy green chilies - de-seeded and chopped 5 tablespoons tomato puree or 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) concentrated tomato paste mixed with 4 tablespoons water, You should add spices generously, tasting and sampling every chance you get. Start with a tablespoon of any of following, adding more or less to fit your preferences:   Cumin (essential) Coriander (essential) Turmeric (essential) Ground chili powder Cardamom Cayenne pepper Cinnamon Curry powder Smoked paprika Garam masala Asafoetida (just a pinch, also called "hing")  

understand how different sauces are created.  pulse or blend your ingredients ahead of time for a smoother sauce.  remember that cooking curry is about method, not a specific recipe.  play with the spices you want to add. 

 In order to evaluate the level of brake fluid in the clutch master cylinder, it is important that your vehicle is level. Parking on a hill or at an angle can cause the level in the master cylinder reservoir to read incorrectly.You may want to allow the vehicle to cool for an hour or two to prevent burning yourself when checking the fluid levels. Parking at an angle may make it appear that you have more or less brake fluid than you actually do.; , Find the hood release on the driver’s left hand side. It is usually located near the door frame with a small image of a car with its hood open. Pull the release back toward you to release the hood. Approach the vehicle from the front and pull the hood up slightly. It will catch on the safety release. Slip your hand beneath the hood and find the lever to release it.In some vehicles, the safety release is located in the grill rather than under the hood. If you are unable to locate the release, check in your vehicle’s owner’s manual for guidance.  With the hood propped open, locate the clutch master cylinder. It is usually located on the firewall of the vehicle, just below the windshield. It will have a plastic reservoir that will be either clear or semi-clear with lines indicating the fluid level inside.If you are having difficulty locating the clutch master cylinder, refer to your vehicle’s service manual for assistance. The clutch master cylinder is usually on the driver’s side of the vehicle.  Inspect the reservoir attached to the clutch master cylinder. There will be at least two lines indicating a minimum acceptable level of brake fluid and a maximum. If the brake fluid does not reach the “full” line, you should add fluid. If it is close or below the minimum line, you should inspect the master cylinder and clutch system for leaks.If the brake fluid is well below the minimum line, there may be a leak somewhere in the system. Leaks not only allow brake fluid to escape, but allow pockets of air to enter which can cause further issue when operating your clutch.  Most vehicles use one of three common types of brakes fluid. It is extremely important that you purchase the correct type of brake fluid for your clutch master cylinder to avoid doing damage to the system or preventing the clutch from engaging. Refer to your vehicle’s owner’s manual to identify what the specific type of brake fluid you need for your vehicle.Most vehicle’s require SAE J1703, US FMVSS or 116 DOT 3 brake fluid in the clutch master cylinder. If you do not have a copy of the owner’s manual for your vehicle, look for the information you need on the automaker’s website.  Poke a hole in the seal on the mouth of the brake fluid, then tear a larger hole on the opposite side. This will allow the brake fluid to pour from the container in a controlled and easily directed fashion. Open the reservoir attached to the clutch master cylinder and pour brake fluid in until it reaches the “full” line.You can tear the seal off of the brake fluid container completely, but it will make it harder to direct your pour without spilling any. Be careful not to overfill the reservoir as it may cause the clutch to not function properly.  Be aware of any dirt or debris that may fall into the clutch master cylinder while it’s open. Even a small amount of sediment can create significant problems for the clutch system. Blocked lines can prevent the clutch from engaging or create a buildup in pressure that can result in leaks.If anything falls into the brake fluid in the open master cylinder, try to scoop the debris out or dab at it with a dry cloth. Keep the lid on the clutch master cylinder reservoir at all times when not filling it.  Once the reservoir if full of brake fluid, inspect the lid for signs of damage before screwing it back on. If the threads on the lid are crossed or damaged, it may prevent a seal from occurring. A failed seal will allow air to enter the clutch lines, which will cause issues with the function of the clutch.If the lid is damaged, place it back on the reservoir and do not drive the vehicle until you purchase a replacement. Replacement lids can be found at your local auto parts store.  Press and depress the clutch pedal with the vehicle running. Feel for inconsistency in the pressure required to do so. Varying levels of pressure are a good indicator that there are pockets of air in the clutch system. If there are any air pockets in the system, you will need to bleed the clutch to remove them.Pockets of air can cause the clutch to not engage or disengage properly. Air in the clutch lines can be a symptom of a leak, so be sure to check carefully for one.  The clutch master cylinder should be dry and free of sticky grime or sludge. If it is covered in grime, clean it off with a rag and some brake cleaner to make it easier to identify signs of a leak. If the brake fluid in the reservoir was very low before filling it, there may be a leak.Once you’ve cleaned the master cylinder, start the vehicle and have a friend press the clutch a few times. Look for signs of bubbles or fluid leaking from the master cylinder. Check the reservoir and master cylinder again after a few days to ensure there are no leaks.  If you did not identify any signs of leaking on the master cylinder or the cap for the reservoir, follow the lines leaving the master cylinder all the way to the slave cylinder. Check the lines and slave cylinder for signs of leaking or bubbling fluid.If you locate a leak, you should have it repaired immediately. After sealing a leak, you will need to bleed the clutch system.  Put the vehicle in first gear and depress the clutch pedal as you apply gas to begin moving forward. Press the clutch again and shift into second gear. If there are any issues with getting the vehicle into our out of gear, it could be a result of the clutch failing to engage and disengage. If you have difficulty getting the transmission into gear, take the vehicle to a service professional to be diagnosed.A failed clutch will not allow you to put the vehicle in gear at all. Slight grinding between gears may be due to clutch pressure issues, but may also be caused by failing synchros within the transmission.  

park your vehicle on level ground.  open the hood.  locate the clutch master cylinder.  check the fluid level.  purchase the correct type of brake fluid for your vehicle.  add brake fluid until it reaches the “full” line on the reservoir.  ensure no dirt or debris falls into the reservoir.  inspect and replace the lid.  check the pressure in the clutch pedal.  look for signs of leaking on the clutch master cylinder.  check the lines and slave cylinder for signs of leaking.  assess whether the clutch disengages properly. 

 The current drywall is in direct contact with the ceiling joists. This allows sound from the floor above to pass directly through the joists with little resistance. Once the old drywall is removed, you can install a new ceiling with an air gap between it and the floor above.  Decoupling alone is very effective at reducing the sound of conversation and high-pitched noises, but it can make low frequencies (such as stomping feet) sound louder! To get the best of both worlds, apply damping compound to a new sheet of thick drywall and screw it onto the subfloor from below.See above for detailed instructions. Take care not to use screws that break through the floor above. Alternatively, complete the rest of this method first, then reinforce the new ceiling with a second layer. Reinforce both ends if extreme soundproofing is required.  Standard R19 fiberglass insulation is just as good as the more expensive "acoustic" insulation. Fill the gaps between the joists, but avoid over-compression, which can carry vibrations through the floor.Cellulose, mineral fiber, cotton, or polyester are effective alternatives. Do not use foam insulation.If you choose the floating ceiling joist approach (see below), install the joists before you insulate.  This is the most effective decoupling method, but may not be feasible if the ceiling space is taken up by ductwork. To do this, install a new joist between each pair of ceiling joists. The new joists should extend 1–2 inches (2.5–5cm) further down than the original joists.Ideally, the floating joist can rest on the inside layer of a decoupled wall. This creates another air gap between the joists and the outside layer of the wall. If you choose this approach, you do not need to follow the rest of the instructions. Just install more drywall over the joists, then fill in the perimeter with acoustic caulk.  Installing hat channel (furring channel) and sound clips is less effective than floating joists, but uses less vertical space. For best soundproofing, choose furring channel marked "087F125-18" or confirm that it meets these specifications: ⅞" (22.2mm) depth; 25 gauge; hemmed long edge. Twenty gauge channel is more common, but significantly worse for soundproofing.Alternatively, you can purchase resilient channel, which is designed for soundproofing. However (at least in North America), resilient channel is not standardized, so it's difficult to guarantee it will work.Read customer reviews before purchasing.  Install the channels no more than 24" (61cm) apart, and position the end channels within 6" (15cm) of the wall. If there is a vent in your ceiling, end the channel flush against the frame of the vent on either side. Place additional short lengths of channel on either side of the vent to increase stability.If the channel is not long enough to reach across the ceiling, overlap channel lengths by at least 6" (15cm) and screw together. Do not install sound clips onto overlapped areas. Place the channels within 16" (41cm) of each other if you plan to support a triple layer of drywall.  Hat channel alone is not very effective, especially under non-dampened drywall.Install soundproofing clips through the hat channel as follows:Place clips around the perimeter of the ceiling, within 6" (15cm) of each wall. Fill in the first channel with sound clips spaced 48" (122cm) apart. For best results, shift the next row's sound clip placement by 16" and fill it out, spacing clips 48" apart as before. Repeat the shift for each row. To save money (using about 10% fewer clips), arrange clips in a grid pattern instead, using the same positioning as the first channel. See your clip product instructions for how to fasten. Avoid over-tightening, which can reduce soundproofing.  Install drywall sections perpendicular to the channels for maximum strength. Fill in gaps around the perimeter with acoustic caulk.   Applying damping compound and adding a second layer of drywall is recommended, especially if you did not reinforce the subfloor above.  

remove the existing ceiling drywall.  reinforce the floor above (recommended).  install insulation between the ceiling joists.  consider floating ceiling joists.  purchase hat channel instead.  install the hat channel perpendicular to the joists.  screw in resilient sound clips.  install drywall over the channel. 

 You need to know two pieces of information to perform this calculation:Interest rate (r). This is the interest rate that the bank quotes for savings accounts of your type. Pay attention to the different rates for different types of accounts. For example, a money market account will generally have a higher interest rate than a savings account, and a savings account will have a higher interest rate than a checking account (if the checking account earns any interest at all). The rate should be expressed as a decimal, so a number like 3% would be used as 0.03.  Compounding frequency (n). Ask a lending official at the bank how often the bank compounds interest per year. ; , There is a fairly simple formula for calculating the APY, based on the annual interest rate and the number of times interest is compounded. This formula is:APY=(1+rn)n−1{\displaystyle {\text{APY}}=(1+{\frac {r}{n}})^{n}-1}   , Suppose, for example, your bank advertises a 1% interest rate on savings accounts and compounds interest quarterly. This means that r=0.01{\displaystyle r=0.01} and n=4{\displaystyle n=4}. Apply these figures to the calculation as follows:APY=(1+rn)n−1{\displaystyle {\text{APY}}=(1+{\frac {r}{n}})^{n}-1}   APY=(1+.014)4−1{\displaystyle {\text{APY}}=(1+{\frac {.01}{4}})^{4}-1}   APY=1.00254−1{\displaystyle {\text{APY}}=1.0025^{4}-1}   APY=0.010038{\displaystyle {\text{APY}}=0.010038}  You probably need an advanced calculator to perform the exponent function for this calculation. Most simple calculators have, at most, a button for squaring a number. You will need a more advanced calculator with a “^” button to raise the number to any chosen exponent.  Notice that, for this example, the APY result is very nearly the same as the bank’s interest rate. The increase is only 0.0038%. Even so, if you have a large amount of money, invested over time, this increase can add up., Suppose, as a second example, the bank offers the same 1.0% interest rate but compounds the interest daily rather than quarterly. In this case, the rate is the same, r=0.01{\displaystyle r=0.01}, but n=365{\displaystyle n=365}.Technically the number of days in a year is probably more accurately represented as 365.25. That difference could become meaningful with large amounts of money. For this example, however, just use n=365{\displaystyle n=365}.   APY=(1+rn)n−1{\displaystyle {\text{APY}}=(1+{\frac {r}{n}})^{n}-1}   APY=(1+.01365)365−1{\displaystyle {\text{APY}}=(1+{\frac {.01}{365}})^{365}-1}   APY=1.0025365−1{\displaystyle {\text{APY}}=1.0025^{365}-1}   APY=0.01005{\displaystyle {\text{APY}}=0.01005}   , When the same interest rate is compounded daily, rather than quarterly, the APY increases from 1.0038% to 1.005%. Again, when working with large amounts of money, over time, this difference gains higher significance. 

gather the necessary data.  use the apy formula.  apply the data and perform the calculation.  interpret the result.  try a different example.  interpret the new result. 

 As of 2012, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) issued new standards for school lunches, which increased the amount of fruits and vegetables served, emphasized whole grain foods, allowed only low fat and nonfat milk, and reduced saturated fats and sodium. By law, your school should offer a daily serving of fruits and vegetables, fresh or in a fruit or veggie cup without added sugar.If your school offers fruit juices as a beverage, they must be 100% juice, with no added sugar. They may also offer dried fruit options. There should be vegetables available in the form of dark leafy greens like broccoli, or spinach, red or orange veggies like carrots or sweet potatoes, and beans or peas like kidney beans or lentils. If starchy foods like corn or white potatoes are served, there should be no added salt. Beans and peas may also be offered as meat alternatives for vegetarian eaters.  It is possible to find healthy options in schools, but the best option is always packing a balanced lunch. According to a report by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, the five worst meals you can eat at school are:Beef and cheese nachos, which contain 24 grams of fat and almost 1,500 milligrams of sodium Meatloaf and potatoes, which contain 72 calories and 78 milligrams of cholesterol Cheeseburgers, which have more saturated fat than a child should consume in an entire meal Cheese sandwiches such as grilled cheese sandwiches and cheese quesadillas, which contain more than 7 grams of saturated fat and almost 1,000 milligrams of sodium Pepperoni pizza, which contains more than 6 grams of saturated fat; pepperoni is a processed meat that increases cancer risk  , Schools in the U.S. are required to serve whole grain options for lunch every school day. These include rice, quinoa, and/or couscous. Look for these healthier grain options in place of carb-heavy foods like bread or pasta.Schools are also required to offer meat alternative foods, like tofu or soy yogurt, which can be a good way to get protein without loading up on red meat.  There should be 100% fruit juice available at your school during lunch time, as well as milk options like fat-free or low-fat, with no added sugars or flavors. Your school should offer at least two types of milk, as well as fruit juices.Try to avoid sugary drinks like soda or fruit juices with added sugar from the vending machines at school.  Portion control is an important way to maintain a healthy diet at school and to ensure you are getting all the nutrients and energy you need for the day. Divide your plate into four sections, with dairy (in the form of fat-free or low-fat milk) on the side. Your plate should be balanced with four types of food: fruits, vegetables, grains, and protein like meat, beans, or tofu.You should have about one cup of grains like rice or pasta, and one cup of vegetables and fruits. Clench your fist and place it over your plate. These portions should be no bigger than your clenched fist. The meat or protein portion should be about as big as your palm. Added fats like butter, mayo, or salad dressing should be the size of the top of your thumb. None of your food should overlap or be piled high. There should be a small amount of space between each of the four food groups.  

look for fruit and vegetable options.  remember that most quick, fast options are laden with salt, sugar and fat.  load up on grains.  look for healthier drink options.  limit your portions. 

 Get a 5-gallon (18.92 l) bucket with an accompanying roller screen from the hardware store or online. Screens will come with two hooks that you can use to hang the screen on the lip of your bucket. Hang the screen so that it hangs on the inside of the bucket.Sometimes buckets will come with the roller screen attached.  Carefully fill the bucket halfway with paint and make sure that at least half of the roller screen is out of the bucket., Dip the roller 1/2 in. (1.27 cm) into the paint. Use the roller screen to guide your paint roller as you dip it into the paint. You don't want to dip the roller too deep into the bucket, or you'll get paint on the side of your roller., Once you've saturated the roller with paint, you should roll it up against the roller screen. The paint should be dripping off the roller and back into the bucket as you do this., Continue dipping the roller slightly into the water before rolling it onto your screen. Once your roller is fully saturated, you're ready to paint. 

hang a roller screen in the bucket.  fill your bucket with paint.  dip the roller into the paint.  roll the paint roller against the roller screen.  repeat the steps five or six times. 

 If you use the mobile app to automatically back up photos and videos, you can safely delete the duplicate copy that remains on your phone or tablet. This is a great way to reclaim lost disk space., Here’s how:Tap the ☰ icon in the search box. Tap “Settings.” Tap “Back up and sync.” Make the “Back up and sync” switch is flipped to the On position. Tap the back arrow to return to your list of photos and videos.  To avoid accidentally deleting photos that haven’t yet backed up, make sure none of your photos show a cloud icon with a line through it. That icon indicates a photo that only exists on your mobile device.If you have photos that haven’t yet backed up, return to “Settings” > “Backup & Sync” and look at “When to back up.” If you have “When charging only” turned on, your phone needs to be plugged in to a power source to back up.  Now you’ll get ready to delete the photos on your device The left side menu will appear.,, The selected items will then be removed from Google Photos.If you’re using iOS, the photos appear in the Recently Deleted album in your iOS Photo App (not Google Photos).  Android users, Photos moved the deleted photos to another folder called “Trash.” The items in Trash will be permanently deleted in 60 days.To delete a photo from Trash now, tap and hold its thumbnail and then tap the trash icon. To restore the photo, open it, then tap the ⁝ menu, and select “Restore.”  

tap the google photos icon.  make sure that automatic backups are turned on.  make sure your photos have been backed up.  tap the ☰ icon on the main screen.  tap “free up space.” a pop-up window will ask you to confirm that you want to remove photos that have already been backed up.  tap “remove.” depending on your device, you may also need to tap “delete” to confirm that you really want to delete the photos.  tap the ☰ icon and select “trash.” ios users can skip this step. 

 Some people reach out to their exes in a moment of weakness, while others do so in hopes of reigniting some romantic interest. However, any attempts at contacting your ex will only dredge up painful feelings for one or both of you, and it will only prolong the inevitable. Remember that you broke up for a reason: one or both of you were fundamentally unhappy, and that won't change.If your ex's phone number was saved on your cellphone, delete his/her contact information and delete any previous text message conversations or phone call records on your phone. Erase, blot out, or discard any physical copies you've written down of your ex's phone number (like from an address book, for example). Consider blocking your ex from contacting you on your cellphone. Generally this is done by going into settings, clicking on privacy, and blocking the number of your ex, though the exact method will vary depending on the type of phone you have. Turn off your phone any time you plan on drinking alcohol (if you meet legal drinking age) so that you do not text or call your ex in a moment of weakness.; , Some people are able to remain friends with an ex. However, if you don't think you can be friends without having romantic feelings for him/her, it may be best to cut off all ties with that individual. Even if you've deleted your ex's phone number, you may still be able to send your ex private messages or comment on photos and status updates.Unfriending/unfollowing your ex on social media will help remove temptation to contact that individual. It can also provide you with space and privacy while you heal from the breakup. Remember that if you remain friends on social media, you'll have to see whom that individual is in a relationship with in the future. You'll also be generally reminded of your time together, which may create feelings of longing. Remember that you can always send your ex a friend request or follow him/her in the future, once you've gotten over the breakup. If you're feeling vulnerable and may try to contact your ex, though, it's best to cut that individual out altogether for the time being.  You may not need to do this, but some people may find it helpful to create some distance between mutual friends while the breakup is still fresh. If you think you might be tempted to ask a mutual friend to "report" on your ex, or if you cannot separate the emotional associations of your ex with your mutual friends, it may be best to create a little space until you've healed and moved on.Let your friends know what you're doing and why. If you don't communicate with them, they may worry that you've decided not to be friends with them as individuals. If your mutual friends bring up your ex around you, ask them to stop doing so, at least until you've healed from the breakup. Avoid any situations or social events where your ex may be present. For example, if your mutual friends host a party or invite you to an event, ask them in advance whether your ex will be there.  The best way to heal yourself emotionally after a breakup is by accepting that the relationship is over. This may be difficult, especially if you were the rejected partner, but recognizing that it could never work out is important.Until you have found some sense of closure, you may continue to feel temptations to call or text your ex, and doing so will only prolong the suffering and emotional vulnerability you're feeling.   It's okay to feel pain and sadness - these feelings are normal. But dwelling on those feelings or convincing yourself that you've lost your "one true love" will only delay your healing. Recognize that it's okay to be alone for a while. You can find other exciting ways to fill your time, and once you've taken time for yourself you'll be ready to begin an even better relationship with someone new.If you're still thinking fondly about your ex or hoping for some type of reconnection, you haven't found closure yet. It's vital that you avoid contacting, seeing, or even accidentally running into your ex during this time in order to heal and move on.  If you're coming out of a long-term relationship, especially with someone you shared a house or apartment with, being alone may feel scary or intimidating. The best way to get over your ex (and distract yourself from any temptation to call him/her) is to be around other people as often as you can.Reach out to friends and family members, even if you haven't seen them or heard from them in a while. It's okay if you have to initiate the planning; the important thing is not to be alone. Try taking up a new hobby or enrolling in a class, and ask a friend to try it out with you. This can be a great distraction from your feelings and a good bonding experience between you and your friend.  After a long relationship, you probably have a lot of physical objects that remind you of your ex. These may be little gifts and shared objects, and seeing them everyday can be a constant reminder of your past relationship. Getting rid of (or at least hiding) these objects that remind you of your ex can help you feel less compelled to contact your ex in the wake of a breakup. Box up anything that reminds you of the other person. Whether it's photographs, gifts, or belongings that he/she left behind, it's best to keep them out of sight. If you can't keep these sentimental reminders in your home without dwelling on your ex or feeling tempted to contact him/her, throw them in the trash. Just be sure to arrange for a mutual friend to return any belongings that your ex may want back before you throw anything out.  Sometimes moving on from a breakup can be difficult. Even after removing the sentimental reminders of your ex, you may find yourself thinking about him or her on a regular basis, and that may give you the urge to contact your ex. If you're having a hard time moving past the breakup, making some changes in your routine or your life in general may help.If you shared a house or apartment, move out and find a new place in a different neighborhood. If you work together or used to work together, consider looking for a new job. If you don't want to leave your job but you still work together and share space, ask your boss if you can change desks to be farther away from one another. Find other ways to change up your routine and your physical surroundings. Do whatever you can to make subtle changes in your life and erase all reminders of your ex.  Whether you were the person who initiated the breakup or your actions/behavior led to your ex breaking up with you, you may be carrying around some guilt. It's important to accept the past and move on in order to heal. Remember that no matter how guilty you may feel, your ex certainly played a role in things falling apart - and that's okay. Moving on means learning how to love yourself and forgive yourself for your mistakes. Eventually, once you've forgiven yourself, you may be able to forgive your ex as well., Every relationship has its ups and downs. Couples often fight, and sometimes things are said that shouldn't have been. However, if your partner has abused you (emotionally or physically), cheated on you, or otherwise neglected your feelings throughout the course of your relationship, there's a good chance that that individual would not make a good friend.Toxic people who have hurt you and may continue to do so in the future should be cut out of your life.This is best for your getting over that ex as well as for your general mental health and wellbeing.  Some people never stop feeling some type of attraction towards another person. That attraction may be physical or emotional, but it can make friendship very difficult. If you don't think you can talk to your ex or be in the same room with him or her without wanting to reconnect on some level, you'll need to accept the fact that you just can't maintain a friendship with that individual.If you're having trouble moving on, make sure you cut off all ties completely and at once. Any time you catch yourself thinking about your ex, make a point of doing something fun and distracting. Go out with friends, watch TV, or find other ways to snap out of that mindset.  Being friends after a breakup almost always requires time and distance apart. You cannot transition from a relationship to a friendship without time to process and heal (if you're able to at all).If you think you can get over the breakup and ultimately become friends with your ex, you'll need to evaluate your feelings towards that person and consider how much time has passed since the breakup.Most people feel sad, lonely, or hurt/betrayed in the wake of a breakup. This is normal, and these feelings will pass with time. There is no universal waiting period for getting over a relationship. For some people it can happen in a week or two, while for others it may take months to get over an ex. If you still feel any kind of longing or resentment towards your ex, not enough time has passed. Once you can think about your ex and not miss him/her or get angry about the breakup, you may be ready to consider transitioning to a friendship. If this doesn't happen, though, you may need to cut your losses and move on without your ex in your life.  

delete your ex's phone number from your contacts list.  unfriend or unfollow your ex on social media.  distance yourself from mutual friends for a while.  try to find a sense of closure.  spend as much time as possible with friends and family.  put away or get rid of sentimental reminders.  change your life to stop thinking about your ex.  forgive yourself for any part you played in the breakup.  consider whether your ex has hurt you.  ask yourself whether you could be friends without wanting a relationship.  assess how much time has passed. 

 The occasion for the speech can go a long way in helping you determine the topic. Your speech topic will vary depending on whether the occasion is celebratory, just plain fun, solemn, or professional. Here are a few ways that the occasion can help influence your speech topic:If the occasion is solemn, such as a funeral or memorial service, then your topic should be serious and relevant to the occasion. If the occasion is fun, such as a toast at a bachelor party, then it's time to bring out the fun anecdotes and stories and to make people laugh -- not to share your passion for coin collecting. If the occasion is celebratory, like a wedding, then you need to provide some light-hearted humor as well as some serious and sentimental points. If the occasion is professional, then you need to stick to a professional topic, such as website design, and not focus on your personal experiences.; , Your purpose is related to the occasion and is the goal you want to achieve through your speech. Your purpose can be to inform, persuade, or just to entertain your audience. A speech can have a variety of purposes, but it's important to be acquainted with the most common purposes:To inform. To inform your audience, you'll need to provide relevant facts and details about a subject that reveals information that allows your audience to see an ordinary subject in a more complicated light, or to learn about a completely foreign subject. To persuade. To persuade your audience, you'll need to use rhetorical techniques, metaphors, and convincing evidence from experts to show them that they should do something, whether it's to elect you for office, recycle more, or take the time to volunteer in their communities. To entertain. To entertain your audience, you'll need to draw on personal or anecdotal examples, tell funny stories, show off your wit, and make your audience crack up, even if you're communicating an underlying serious message. To celebrate. If you're celebrating a specific person or event, you'll need to show your audience what makes that person or thing so special, and to garner enthusiasm for your subject.  If you want to select a topic that suits your purpose and is relevant to the occasion, then you should eliminate a variety of topics before you even start brainstorming ideas. This will make it easier for you not to offend or just bore your audience as you move forward with your ideas. Here are a few things to consider as you cross those potential topics off your list:   Don't pick anything so complicated that it would be impossible to inform your audience. If you pick something so complex that it can't be explained in a short amount of time or without pages of charts or diagrams, then you will lose your audience. Don't pick something that's so simple that your audience could understand it in just a minute or two. If your topic is so basic that you'll only be repeating yourself after you've said just a few sentences, then you'll lose your audience's interests as well. You want to keep your audience members on their toes, not knowing what to expect next. Don't pick anything that's too controversial. Unless you're at a convention for controversial speeches, it's best to avoid topics that are too controversial, like abortion or gun control. Of course, if your goal is to persuade your audience to agree with one side of these issues, then you should go ahead with your speech, but know that you may lose many people before you begin. Don't pick anything that doesn't fit the mood of the audience. If it's a celebratory occasion, don't give a dry speech about irrigation; if it's a professional occasion, don't give an emotional speech about how much you love your mother.  

consider the occasion.  consider your purpose.  know which topics to avoid. 

 It will either be given directly in the problem, or two consecutive terms will be given from either the start or the end of the arithmetic progression. Let the common difference be denoted by d.; , First term and last term are required to find out the number of terms of an Arithmetic Progression. Identify them and note them down. Let the first term be represented by A and let the last term be represented by L.  Divide the common difference (d) into the difference between the last term (L) and the first term (A), and then add 1.  

find out the common difference.  identify the first and last term of the sequence.  calculate the number of terms by using the following formula: let the number of terms be represented by n. the formula is:  n = (l-a)/d + 1  the formula is very simple. 

 The method of cooking your chicken is extremely important in determining the cut of meat you should use. This is because the thickness, flavor, and texture of a cut will be impacted by the cooking process.   If you choose to bake your chicken, you can pick just about any specific cut of meat, but the amount of time you bake may vary on thickness. You can fry (pan fry or deep fry) just about any cut of meat, but make sure to fry thicker pieces longer and to pull out smaller pieces so they don’t overcook. If you decide to grill or BBQ your chicken, you’ll have to make sure you cook specific pieces for longer or shorter amounts of time as they may dry out. When stewing meat, you’ll want to either drop in whole pieces and allow them to fall apart in the stew or broth, or you can precut them. Make sure you're prepared for the slow cooking process. You may need to invest in a slow cooker or a crock pot., The more time you have, the more choices you have when it comes to the specific cut of chicken. Thus, you should determine exactly how much time you have before you pick a specific cut of chicken.   The bigger and fleshier the piece of meat, the longer you’ll need to cook it. Thus, make sure you reserve long periods of time, like an hour or more, for large pieces like breasts or even entire birds. If you have very little time, you should choose a small cut of meat. For example, pick wings or legs if you need to grill chicken in less than half an hour., When choosing the right cut of chicken, you need to consider the costs of each one. Ultimately, the cost of each cut might influence what dish you prepare.   The cost of different cuts of chicken will vary based on region. Breast fillet and breast tenderloin are the most expensive cuts of chicken. Wings and drumsticks are often the cheapest pieces of the chicken. Whole chickens, on the average, are substantially cheaper than buying individual cuts., You can potentially save a lot of money by buying chicken in bulk. In the end, you'll be able to drastically lower the cost of any cut of chicken you want by buying in quantity.   Purchase chicken at a wholesaler like Costco, Sam's Club, or BJ's. Freeze chicken you won't use within a few days. Buy chicken from a farmer or at a farmer's market. Purchase whole chickens and cut them up yourself. 

pick how you will cook your meal.  determine how much time you have.  compare the cost of different cuts.  save money by buying in bulk. 

 The ideal time to divide perennial plants is in early spring or late fall. These are times when the plants are in dormant stages, and this will minimize shock to the plant and improve root growth.It’s also important to divide perennials during periods of dormancy because this will ensure they're not blooming. Avoid dividing rose bushes when they're in bloom. Dividing roses is less popular than propagating by cuttings because it’s more difficult and time consuming. Dividing requires you to uproot an established plant, cut it in half, and replant the two halves.  To propagate roses by division, you'll need a healthy and established rose plant, as well as some garden tools and equipment, such as:   Sharp and sterilized knife or razor Shovel or spade Gardening gloves Two large buckets Damp newspaper A prepared garden plot Fertile soil  , To make sure that your divided rose bushes will thrive and produce healthy flowers, choose a healthy and established plant to divide. A healthy plant will:Have plenty of leaves Have leaves that are distributed evenly around the plant Produce lots of flowers  , To minimize shock to the plant before you uproot and divide it, water the bush thoroughly. This will also help to loosen the soil around the roots, making it easier to remove the plant from the ground without damaging the roots.  With the shovel, start digging into the ground in the area around the rose bush. You need to dig up the plant, but must avoid digging into and damaging the roots. Once you’ve cleared the area around the plant, use your hands to brush away soil and expose the roots.   When the roots are exposed and the area around the plant has been dug up, carefully pull the plant up from the ground.  Lay the rose bush on the ground or place it into a wheelbarrow. With a sterilized pruning saw or knife, divide the plant into two equal halves by cutting the roots down the middle of the plant.   To sterilize your cutting tool, heat the metal with fire until it’s red hot, or boil it for 30 minutes in water.  Once the plant has been divided, place each half into a bucket and transfer the buckets to a shady place to protect them while you prepare the garden plot. To keep the plants moist, cover them with damp newspaper.   Ideally, you want to keep the humidity around 50 percent to keep the plants moist without soaking them too much., In the area where you removed the original rose bush, replace the soil you dug up with fertile soil or organic matter to make sure there are plenty of nutrients in the garden bed for the new plants. Use your hands or a spade to mix in the new soil and spread it around the garden bed.   Good organic matter to add to the soil include aged compost or manure.  Dig two holes in the garden bed you’ve prepared to the same depth as the original plant. Make the holes about 24 inches (60 cm) apart. Plant the individual rose bushes in the holes and cover the roots with soil. Pack the soil around the roots with your hands.   Water the plants thoroughly. Keep the rose bushes moist during the first year that they're establishing themselves. 

pick the right time.  gather your supplies.  select a healthy plant to divide.  water the rose bush.  dig up the rose bush carefully.  cut the plant into equal halves.  keep the roots moist.  prepare the plots.  replant the two halves. 

 It can be difficult to figure out emotions or feelings if you're autistic, so the first thing to do is to determine if you have a crush on this person. Find a way of sorting out what you feel by writing it out or talking about it with a trusted friend, and look for any key signs that you might have a crush.   Does this person cause a jumble of thoughts to come rushing into your head all at once? You could have a crush on them. If you want to spend most of your time with this person, or if something exciting happens and you wish they were there to see it, then you may have a crush. If you stim when excited or nervous, try to keep an eye on how much you're stimming whenever you're around this person. If you start stimming a lot whenever you think of or are around this person, then it's possible you have a crush. If you smile a lot when thinking about them or talking to them, you could possibly have a crush. If you could previously speak somewhat smoothly around this person, and now you're suddenly tripping over your words, or are unsure of what to say all the time around them, you could have a crush. If you are shy around this person and are afraid of the impression you'll give off in conversation, you probably have a crush. If you regularly fantasize about spending time with this person, or even things like dating or kissing them, you definitely have a crush.; , If you do have a crush, pretending that you don't have a crush isn't a very good course of action! While it can seem like a great way of dealing with it, when you eventually end up admitting it to yourself, it'll only end up making it worse. It's important to accept your feelings and recognize how you think of this person.  Sometimes, crushes can make you feel funny or like there's something wrong with you. It's important to realize that there's nothing wrong with having a crush on someone, and that most people end up getting a crush at some point in their life. As long as you respect the person you have a crush on and don't do anything to intentionally make them uncomfortable, there's nothing wrong with liking someone.   If you don't have a crush, there's nothing wrong with that, either. Not having crushes doesn't mean that you're broken or that there's something the matter with you. It's possible you may be aromantic, or that you don't feel romantic attraction, and there's nothing "broken" about that.  When it comes to crushes, there's a lot of conflicting advice - tell, or don't tell? Be affectionate, or just behave normally? What you choose to do is often dependent on the factors of the situation, but it's usually best to take time out to decipher what you think is best.   If your crush is significantly older or younger than you, it may be best to avoid telling them about your feelings or showing affection. You may get taken advantage of, or be viewed as "creepy".  Unfortunately, not everyone in the world has good intentions, and it can be hard to figure out whom to avoid—especially if you have a crush. It's extremely important to tell who is a friend and who's not, as confessing your feelings to your crush may open up a window for you to be taken advantage of, and as a result, get badly hurt.   Don't take this to mean that you should assume everyone is a bad person. Many people have good intentions, and if they find out you have a crush on them, their initial response won't be to hurt you. However, there are some people in the world with malicious intent and who may want to string you along or play mind games with you. For this reason, be careful about who you associate with. Avoid telling your crush how you feel if they belittle groups of people - for example, if they mock people of a different race than them or use "autistic" as an insult. This person probably isn't the kind of person you would want to be in a relationship with, no matter if you think they like you back or not.  

recognize if you have a crush.  accept your feelings.  realize there's nothing wrong with crushes.  determine the best course of action.  be wary. 

 Kittens habitually clean themselves with their tongues, but there are some spots that they have trouble reaching – namely, the head, the back, and the behind. Mother cats usually help kittens clean these spots. Your job, as surrogate mother cat, is to clean your kitten regularly to ensure that she is healthy and hygienic.Wiping with a wet cloth also uses less water than a full bath. This makes it a good way to gradually and safely introduce kittens to water and washing.; , Many kittens, especially young kittens, are very messy eaters. After the kitten has eaten, massage her entire body with a clean, moist cloth. Pay special attention to the abdomen and genital region – this may encourage her to relieve herself.  Make sure that the towel is not rough enough to irritate your kitten. If the kitten is particularly dirty, consider dabbing the cloth with a vet-recommended pet shampoo. You can find special kitten shampoos in most pet shops.  Use a cloth wet with warm water. Always follow the direction of the fur to avoid hurting or irritating your cat. Hold your kitten and talk to her in a soothing voice to make her comfortable. Many kittens are used to being petted on the back, so restrain your cleaning to that area until the kitten is okay with the cloth.If your kitten gets nervous or scared at any time in the cleaning process, stop washing for a moment and hold her close. Continue to talk in the soothing voice. Your kitten may begin to trust you more once she knows that you will respond to her complaints.  Start from the face and forelegs, move to the back and abdomen, and finish with the hindquarters. Avoid the kitten's eyes, ears, and nose! Unless the kitten's head is extremely dirty, it may be best to avoid the head altogether. Don't worry, however: the kitten will likely clean its head on its own after the bath.  Kittens have trouble cleaning this area by themselves, and it is where their mother likely helped them the most. This is why cats will often turn around and stick their back ends in your face while you're petting them: it's a sign of trust, like they trusted their mother at a very young age.Consider cleaning your kitten's behind every few days, especially if she does not clean herself. This will help keep your kitten happier and healthier, and it will keep odors away. If your cat isn't cleaning herself, it can be a sign that she is overweight.  If there is still more dirt on her coat, you can repeat the process by using another cloth. When your kitten is completely clean, put her in a warm place to cuddle up while she dries out.   Blot the excess water with a dry towel to make sure that your kitten is almost completely dry. If you leave her wet and shivering, she may be at risk of falling ill.  

if your kitten isn't too dirty, wipe her down with a wet cloth.  aim to clean her after every feeding.  wet a soft, dry cloth with lukewarm water.  start washing the kitten's back.  gently wipe your kitten from front to back.  pay special attention to the area beneath the tail.  keep on wiping your kitten until she is clean. 

 Chop roughly. Peel the onions, chop roughly. Remove the stem and seeds from the bell peppers. Chop roughly. Core the apples. Chop roughly. Leave the peel intact. Mince the garlic cloves.  Tip in the apple cider vinegar and the salt. Stir together.  Bring to the boil, then turn down to a simmer. Let simmer for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Stir now and then, checking that the mixture isn't burning on the base.  Remove the seeds from half of the peppers.   Wear gloves to stop your hands from stinging.  All items used for canning must be sterilized too (lids, seals, tongs, spoons).  Mix through, then cook on a simmer for another 5 minutes.  Mash the relish with a potato masher. Boil again.  Seal and label. The seals must pop down; if not, that jar hasn't worked––transfer the ingredients back for more boiling or freeze the ingredients instead. (If still waiting for the lids to go down after the relish completely cools down, keep the relish in the refrigerator. After 12 hours, decide not to preserve the relish but instead consume it from the fridge within the next 2 weeks.)   To freeze, place inside sterilized glass jars but allow room for expansion during freezing. 

prepare the ingredients:  remove the core and stem from the tomatoes.  add the chopped ingredients to a heavy-based preserving pan or pot.  place the pot over high heat.  chop the jalapeño peppers into small pieces.  sterilize the jars to be used for the relish.  when the relish has boiled down, add the chopped jalapeño peppers, the fresh cilantro and the dried cumin.  remove from the heat.  transfer the hot relish into the hot sterilized jars.  finished.  

 Dip a hand brush into a bucket of water and scrub down all the areas where you, or any other people, sat during the steaming. 30 seconds of scrubbing should be enough for regular cleaning.Rinse the wood down with clean water when you are finished.Keep your brush and bucket near the door to remind you to clean as you leave the sauna.; , If you notice stains on the wood from sweat, you don’t want those to stay. Dip your hand brush into a solution of warm water and a mild detergent and Use towels in the sauna to prevent stains. You don’t necessarily want to wear one during the steam, but at least lay one down on the bench where you will be sitting. This will prevent too much sweat, dirt, and dead skin from getting into the wood, which is what causes stains.If stains are particularly difficult to get out, use a light sandpaper to sand down that part of the wood.  If you tracked dirt, hair, or other stuff on to the floor, use a vacuum to pick up any loose particles. Even if you don’t see any dirt, vacuum every few weeks to get anything that might be in there., These include drains or ventilation where moisture may gather, places that might not dry as quickly and can breed pathogens. Take them out of the sauna, and scrub down with a disinfectant to prevent mold and bacteria., Clean out your sauna with soap and a hose to rinse it down. You don’t want anything stronger than a mild cleaner, so avoid stronger chemicals like ammonia. You should do this every few days if you use the sauna everyday, though you can do it less if you don’t use it as often., At least once a year, make sure to sand down your benches with a fine sandpaper. This will help get rid of any impurities that may have gathered over the year, as well as smooth out the surface again. When you are finished, the wood should be a “like new” white color., If you notice mold, go after it immediately. A bleach solution is probably your best bet to get rid of it, though certain saunas make their own chemical cleaners., It can be beneficial to mop the floor with a deodorizing cleaner to get rid of any odors left over. Remember to avoid harsher chemical cleaners, and stick to soap and water, or cleaners supplied by your sauna’s manufacturers., If your sauna is a separate building outdoors, use a pressure washer to clean off the outside. This will keep your sauna looking nice.Be very careful not to use the pressure washer on the interior. The wood inside the sauna is softer, and the pressure washer can damage it.  Like any room or building, your sauna will probably also have little things that need work. Make sure to tighten any loose screws and brush out water spots as they appear.This will keep your sauna in good condition, and prevent you from having to do more work later.   If your sauna has a wooden door, the humidity may cause the door to swell. Keep an eye on the door’s hinges to make sure it opens and closes properly. 

scrub the benches, walls, and backrests after use.  scrub stains with a hand brush.  vacuum up the floor.  disinfect any grates.  rinse out the sauna.  sand benches annually.  clean out mold.  mop the floor.  periodically pressure wash the exterior.  perform general maintenance. 

 Scented cubes are small wax cubes with a powerful scent. Most large retailers carry scented cubes and there are hundreds to choose from. While most people place them on a warmer,causing them to melt and emit a smell, they can be used alongside candles.  Using a candle of your choosing, let it burn for several minutes or until about an inch-deep pool of melted wax has accumulated around the wick. Once this happens, place the scented wax cube into the melted wax. The flame will help the scented wax continue to melt down and emit a strong smell that will fill up the room.   Sense the wax cubes are so strong, consider cutting them in half using a butter knife.  The scented wax will melt to form a layer of wax. Every time you light this candle, the scented wax layer will continue to emit a smell for quite some time.  

purchase scented cubes.  light the candle.  continue to enjoy. 

 If you've caught your teen in a lie, you'll need to address the lie and the underlying behavior (whatever he/she was lying about). However, it's imperative that you do this as carefully as you can. Otherwise your teen will just get upset back at you, and may be less likely to communicate with you about other things.Don't act triumphant or satisfied by catching your teen in a lie. Your teen's safety should be your number one priority. State things as a matter of fact. Be direct and open without being aggressive. Say something like, "I want to talk to you about something. You told me _____ the other day, but I know for a fact that you were lying. I've talked to _____ and they told me your story isn't true." Ask your teen directly why he or she felt the need to lie to you.; , It's incredibly important that you don't lose your temper while dealing with your teen's lies. The situation is already difficult, and getting angry or upset will only make the situation worse.If you remain calm, your teen is more likely to continue carrying on a conversation with you. If you yell, though, your teen may just storm off.It's okay if you're upset, but don't take your anger out on your teenager.That will only make a bad situation worse. Calm down before talking to your teenager when you've found out he/she has lied to you. Take deep breaths, try counting to 10, go for a walk, or make a cup of tea or coffee before you sit down to talk with your teen. Say something like, "Go wait in your room. I'll be up shortly, and we're going to talk about what happened." Try to remain calm when you do talk. Your teen is likely to get upset, so you'll need to be the steady, rational one in this conversation.  Start out by letting your teen know that his/her lies have hurt you and weakened your trust. This doesn't mean trying to guilt your teen, but you should let your teen know that his/her lies affect you and have a negative impact on your parent/child relationship.Don't call your teen a liar or label your teen as untrustworthy. You should let your teen know that lying weakens your ability to trust him/her, though. Use your moment of disapproval as an opportunity to teach your teen a lesson. Try to focus on the risky behavior your teen is engaging in rather than the lie.Talk about what happened and why your teen made the decisions that were made. Try to get at the reasons behind the lie so that you can better understand your teen's behavior. Ask what your teen can do differently next time (both to avoid the situation that was lied about and to avoid lying to you).  The best way to prevent future lies is by making your teen feel that you are approachable. If your teen feels like he/she can come to you with problems or to confess bad behavior without getting yelled at or punished, it will make your teen more likely to trust you (and by extension, you'll be able to trust your teen as well).   Remember that correcting a habit of lying is a process, not something that can be solved with a simple solution. Your teen needs to feel that he/she can be honest and open with you, which may take time.Let your teen know that you love him/her, and that you don't expect your teen to be perfect. Tell your teen that he or she would be less likely to get into trouble by coming to you with the truth than by hiding it or lying to you. You may want to consider offering your teen one last chance to come clean. Tell your teen that if he or she is willing to be honest about the situation at hand, you'll forgive him/her this time and hold off on punishment.Make it clear that there will be strict punishment for lying next time. You should also stress that when your teen lies to you, it makes it harder for you to have trust and grant freedom/independence to your teen.  If your teen continues to engage in bad behavior and lie about it, he or she obviously hasn't learned a lesson yet. If this happens, you may need to start enforcing the rules and punishing your teen when you find out about lies in the future.Tell your teen what will happen if you catch a lie in the future (grounded, loss of privileges, additional chores, no allowance, etc) and enforce that consequence if it happens again. Never resort to acts of violence as "punishment." Physically abusing your teen is illegal and immoral, and it will destroy any chance for a healthy relationship. Most teens want more freedom (and many lie to get that freedom). By restricting your teen's access to freedom, you will ideally be teaching your teen that the only way to get that independence is through honesty and good behavior.  Most compulsive liars get something out of lying. Often this type of behavior is motivated by issues involving self-esteem. If your teen is compulsively lying, even in situations where there's no reason to lie (nothing to be gained and no punishment to be avoided), you may need to intervene.Reassure your teen that you love him or her. Let your teen know that you're available to talk any time he/she is feeling unhappy or unsatisfied. If your teen suffers from depression or has some other reason for compulsively lying, you may want to seek out a therapist who's qualified to work with adolescents. Ask your teen's doctor or pediatrician for a recommendation. The doctor may know someone who specializes in adolescent depression and/or compulsive lying. You can also search online for adolescent therapists in your area, or use the database at Psychology Today to find a specialist near you., For many teens, drugs and alcohol are a part of a passing phase of experimentation. However, this experimentation is not necessarily harmless. Even "low-level" intoxicants like alcohol and marijuana can have serious effects on your teen's health, especially since your teen is still growing and developing. Casual usage can also lead to addiction, and any usage could easily tarnish your teen's legal record if he or she gets caught.If your teen is engaging in drug or alcohol abuse, you should have a frank conversation about the dangers of drugs and alcohol, and if things don't improve you may need to enlist the help of a qualified mental health expert.Lying about illegal or dangerous behavior needs to be addressed directly. Often some underlying issue like depression, anxiety, or self-esteem problems will cause a teen to seek out intoxicants. If your teen is lying about drugs or alcohol and talking to him/her hasn't helped, search online or in the phone book to find a mental health expert in your area who deals with adolescents and addiction.  If you're worried about your teen telling you the truth, it may be helpful to know the things teens lie about most often. You can't accuse your teen of lying about everything, but if you know what your teen is most likely to lie about, you can prevent future instances of that behavior. Some of the most common behaviors teens lie about include:   how teens spend their time what teens spend their allowance on seeing friends that their parents don't approve of which movies your teen sees and whom your teen goes with what types of clothing your teen wears outside the house drinking alcohol and/or doing drugs driving under the influence or riding in cars with a driver who was under the influence going to parties having adult supervision outside the house  , It's tough to know when your teen is lying, and any suspicions should be approached very cautiously. Being overly suspicious of your teen actually makes you statistically less likely to know what your teen is lying about. You may be more likely to recognize your teen is lying about something when you're suspicious, but you'll probably be wrong about what your teen lies about and why.Accusing your teen of lying when he or she is actually telling the truth may make your teen less likely to be open and honest with you in the future. Try to evaluate your teen's behavior in the context of his or her past patterns of behavior. If your teen is getting into trouble (or has a history of doing so), that teen may be more likely to lie to you. Remember that no teen is lying about everything all the time. You may have your suspicions, but you need to recognize that your teen does tell the truth as well, and you need to be fair in your assessment of his/her honesty.  Some parents may not be comfortable trying to catch their teens in a lie. However, if you have your suspicions and you want to put a stop to it, it may be worth considering checking out your teen's story. This can help establish a baseline of behavior so you'll know what to expect going forward.If your teen claims to have spent the day at a friend's house, call that friend's parents and confirm that this is true. You may want to try quizzing your teen to see if he/she is telling the truth. Remember what your teen says, and ask follow-up questions later on to see if your teen sticks to the same story you were told earlier. With that said, it's important to recognize that trying to "trap" your teen in a lie will only discourage open and honest communication with you. Resist the urge to spy on your teen or go through his/her belongings. This can damage your teen's trust in you and set back your lines of communication.  Whether you've caught your teen in a lie or you simply don't believe your teen's story, you should express this to your teen as calmly and directly as possible. Don't get mad, and don't accuse your teen of lying; instead, open a conversation about what your teen has told you.Don't interrogate your teen. That will only make your teen more likely to lie to you again. Let your teen know that you don't entirely believe the story you're being told. Give your teen a way out. He/she may be willing to tell the truth if you offer some type of immunity from punishment. You can say something like, "We're reasonably sure that you're not telling us the truth. Are you sure you want to stick with your version of events, or is there something else you'd like to tell us?"  , Many adults lie to other adults for the same basic reasons your teen may be lying to you: to avoid getting into trouble, or to be able to keep doing things you know you're not supposed to. Lying to others while you punish your teen for lying sets a bad example and makes you look like a hypocrite. Instead of lying to cover your tracks, be open and honest about your actions and your motivations. Then show your teen that it worked out much better for you to be honest about the situation.Avoid telling so-called "white lies." Don't lie to your boss if you're late to work. Apologize for being late and start leaving for work a little earlier so it doesn't happen again. Resist the urge to withhold information from your partner. Be honest and open, and show your teen how much better your relationship is because of that honesty. Be honest if your teen asks you hard questions. Rather than lying about your past bad behavior, tell the truth and admit it was a mistake.  Many teens who habitually lie to their parents have a hard time seeing their own inherent value. A good way to prevent future lies is by spending as much time as possible with your teen and conveying that you see tremendous potential in him/her.Spending time together lets you know what's going on in your teen's life, and it lets your teen feel that you're approachable if he/she needs to talk. It also shows that you take an interest in your teen and want what's best for him or her.   You should ideally aim to spend some time with your teen every day. Open up an honest dialogue by talking about your day and asking your teen about his or her day. You can try spending time together by doing something your teen enjoys. You might play video games together, go for a walk in the woods, or some other activity that will make your teen happy.  As you spend time with your teen, convey the importance of honesty and communication. You don't have to say this explicitly, but you should let your teen feel that trust between the two of you helps you to know that your teen is safe and will make the right decisions.   Remind your teen that you will trust him or her more if you're shown honesty and trustworthiness. Let your teen know that lies make it hard to trust one another. Don't punish your teen if he or she comes to you needing advice about a tricky situation. Doing so will only make your teen less likely to come to you for help in the future.  If your teen learns how to make smart, healthy decisions, there's less of a chance your teen will need to lie to you about doing something wrong. Teens are most capable of independence when they're able to identify emotions, exhibit some sense of self-control, cope with unpleasant emotions, and make informed decisions to solve their own problems.Many teens lie to cover up behavior they know was bad. If you can eliminate that bad behavior, you should be able to trust your teen more and more. Promote open discourse. Let your teen know that he or she can come to you for advice, and offer helpful feedback without judgment. Talk to your teen about how to evaluate a situation and make the right decision. You should also talk to your teen about how to cope with unpleasant feelings in healthy, productive ways.  Teenagers typically want increasing amounts of freedom. They're approaching adulthood and want the independence to make their own decisions without having to ask for permission. While you'll still need to monitor your teen's behavior, you may need to give your teen a little more freedom if it means he/she will be more honest with you.If you're willing to compromise on things like what time your teen's curfew is, which friends your teen can spend time with, or where your teen can go, he or she is less likely to feel the need to lie. Compromising doesn't mean giving in to all of your teen's demands, nor does it mean being unwilling to hear your teen's requests. Sit down with your teen and work out a give-and-take solution. For example, if your teen's curfew is 9:00 PM and he or she wants to stay out until midnight, compromise on 10:30 or 11:00. Be willing to make exceptions under certain conditions. For example, if your teen wants to go to a concert that will end past his or her curfew, let your teen go but offer to chaperone or drive your teen. By compromising and simultaneously establishing some kind of presence in your teen's activities (as in the concert example), you can prevent your teen's need to lie about where he/she is, what time your teen will be home, and how your teen will get home.  It's important to stress to your teen that the choices he/she makes will determine how much freedom and independence you'll give. This can make it feel less like punishment, since your teen will understand that you're responding to his or her behavior.   Give your teen the independence he or she wants, but make it clear that a violation of your trust will affect that level of freedom. Remind your teen that independence as an adult comes with a great price. You can only maintain your independence as an adult if you follow certain social rules and laws, just as your teen must follow your rules at home.This leaves the ball in your teenager's court, so to speak. If your teen wants to maintain that independence or gain new freedoms, he or she will have to prove trustworthy. Reward your teen with more independence as he/she demonstrates trustworthiness and honesty. You might try extending your teen's curfew or giving your teen extra allowance, for example. Restrict your teen's freedom when you catch him/her lying. Remind your teen that you made it clear that lies will result in reduced freedom, and enforce the rules.  

let your teen know when you've caught him/her lying.  maintain control of your emotions.  convey your disapproval.  encourage more open communication in the future.  set and enforce consequences for lying.  deal with compulsive lying.  address lying about risky behavior like drug and alcohol use.  know the most frequent lies.  approach the situation with caution.  plan out ways to check if your teen is lying.  convey your suspicions.  set a good example by being honest.  spend more time with your teen.  promote honest, open communication.  teach your teen to solve problems and make good decisions.  be willing to compromise.  let your teen's behavior determine his/her freedom.

 An endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) is a major surgical procedure in which small incisions are made in the side of the chest, and the nerves that control sweating in the palms are cut or clipped.It has been shown to cure sweaty palms in up to 92% of patients., While ETS can permanently cure sweaty palms, it has serious associated risks:   Sweating returns in approximately 6% of patients who are initially cured.The more effectively ETS reduces sweaty palms, the more likely it is to lead to compensatory sweating elsewhere, particularly the face and neck.It can lead to bleeding into the chest during surgery. Air can become trapped inside the chest, causing pain and difficulty breathing. Damage to the nervous system many cause the upper eyelid on one side of the body to droop permanently., Because of the possible serious side effects, doctors will usually try to control sweaty palms in other ways before resorting to surgery. However, if preventative treatments fail, ETS may be a good options. 92% of patients who receive ETS say they would ask for the operation again if it were to be redone. 

use surgery to permanently cure sweaty palms.  know the risks of ets.  consult your doctor to see if ets surgery is right for you. 

 If you are following a set of instructions for an official LEGO car set, make sure you have the instructions and all the pieces needed for your car. If you are designing your own car, make sure you have a variety of LEGO pieces handy so that you can create whatever you want.   For a very basic LEGO car, you will need a minimum of 4 tires of the same size, 2 axles of the same size, and at least one long LEGO piece to connect them. LEGO also manufactures pieces like steering wheels, seats, windshields, and car doors that you may enjoy adding to enhance your car’s details.; , A table or desk near a bright lighting source is a good place to build a LEGO car. You want to find a space that’s big enough for you to spread out your pieces (and instructions, if you’re using them).   LEGO pieces are small and can pose a choking hazard to pets and small children if they’re left lying around. If they’re left on the floor they might also be stepped on, which can be painful. Building on the floor will work, but keep an eye on your pieces to make sure they stay in a contained area.  Organize the pieces by size and shape, so it is easier to pick the pieces you need.   If working with small children, make sure the children do not put the LEGO pieces in their mouths, as they are a choking hazard.  

gather your lego materials.  find a safe, clear space to build the car.  spread your lego pieces neatly in front of you. 

 Remember that if you ask your Mom for something, and she says no, do not throw a temper tantrum. Otherwise, your Mom will never change her mind, and never buy you the item. If you do throw the fit then either your Mom will punish you (unless she's really nice), or never buy you the item.; , Avoid situations where tempers can get out of control. If you need to talk to her about something, find out what kind of mood she is in. If she is stressed from work, trying to deal with a sibling's problem, or household responsibilities, she may not be able to deal with you at that moment.  If you can tell you may be on the verge of pushing the "wrong" button, back off, and let the matter rest.  If an issue is pressing and you need some time to think about it, or just to cool down, back off before anyone loses control.  Take responsibility for situations when you are able to. If there is something you can do about a situation without involving your mom, try to deal with it yourself. If you want a new pair of shoes, and don't think she will buy them, look for a job or other source of income, or save up and buy them yourself.  If you are frequently arguing about a particular chore, do it in a timely manner, and your mom won't have to fuss at you, which in turn may make you cop an attitude.  Don't always complain you don't get what you want. You should consider both how much you do get, and how able she is to provide what you want. Often, we do not consider how well off we are, nor do we consider how hard parents work and scrimp to provide what we have.  Even if you are dead set on getting what you want, you may be better off compromising than losing an argument and having hurt feelings.  Keep your problems with your siblings, peers, teachers, and others out of your attitude with your Mom. If you are mad or upset with someone else, your Mom does not deserve to take abuse from you because of it.  Remember that your Mom probably wants what is best for you, and, in fact, may know better than you do what that is.  Therefore complaining about yours won't help at all. But you can also "swap" and tell each other about your day.  Make sure to listen to what she has to say.  When she asks you to do something, do it; don't give her a chance to complain.  

don't throw a tantrum.  avoid out-of-control tempers.  be aware of her body language and tone.  be aware of your own mood.  be responsible.  be proactive about situations which may cause conflict.  stop complaining.  try to compromise with her.  keep your problems with others.  know that she's looking out for you.  remember that she too might have had a tough day.  listen to her.  follow her commands. 

 Before planting the Elephant Ear tuber, wait until the danger of frost is over and the temperature averages 45ºF (7ºC) or more.; , The adult Elephant Ear plant will need at least 3 feet (1 meter) of space, at a bare minimum, for proper growth and show in a relatively shady area. A really healthy plant may need as much as 5 feet (1-2 meters) of space.  Dig a hole, (if possible, in rich organic soil) about 3-4 times the size of the tuber.  Refill the hole as necessary with loose soil enough so that the tuber will be about 1-2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm.) below ground level when planted.  Lay (plant) the tuber with its top up - if in doubt, plant the tuber sideways and let nature figure it out!  , After the tubers have been planted and covered with soil, water the area deeply. After watering, about 1" to 2" (2.5 cm - 5 cm) of soil should cover the tuber.  It will take a few weeks for the plant to emerge from the soil. Use a stake or other marker so you won't forget where you planted the Elephant Ear.  The amount of time it takes for the first growth to show depends on the air and ground temperature.  Elephant Ear plants perform reasonably well in average soil. Periodic fertilization (every 2 to 4 weeks) with a common plant fertilizer will help them do their best.  Good drainage is a big plus, but the plant should not be left to go dry for any length of time. When this happens, the droopy leaves will give early enough warning for the plant to recover nicely if watered within a day.  At the peak of the warm season, large, beautifully lush foliage can grow to heights of 3 to 5 feet (1-1.6 meters). If any leaves turn brown at the edges, just cut away and new ones will certainly grow.  The plant will start having difficulties when the temperature falls below 50ºF (9-10ºC) or so for more than a few days. Before freezing temperatures take over, the tuber (root system) will have to be dug up.  A healthy plant will have developed multiple new tubers during the growing season. It's best to leave these intact during storage. Separation will not do significant damage though.  Trim most of the green vegetation (top growth) off the top of the tubers: leave no more than half to 1 inch of leafy growth on the tuber. Let the freshly trimmed tubers sit in open air so they can visibly dry out before final storage - maybe a couple of days at most will do. Drying out minimizes the potential for mold and bacteria to develop.  During the colder, winter months, store the tubers in a cool, dry place (45-55ºF is desirable). Don't store in a plastic bag. Instead, a plain paper bag with plenty of holes for ventilation will do nicely, as will storage in sphagnum peat moss or garden vermiculite.  When the warm season comes around again, separate the tubers as necessary, plant anew and enjoy![[Image:Grow Elephant Ear Plants Step 16.jpg}} 

plant when the soil warms up in the spring.  give the plant plenty of room.  select a planting spot.  prepare the planting hole.  set the plant in the planting hole.  cover the tuber with soil.  mark the spot where the tuber is planted.  wait 1 to 3 weeks.  care for your plant.  water frequently.  trim away faded leaves.  dig up the plant when the weather turns cold.  leave the tubers intact.  prepare the tubers for storage.  store the tuber.  re-plant the tubers in the spring. 

 Maltipoos require a high-quality food to stay healthy. It is also important to choose a food that is appropriate for small breed dogs because food for larger breeds may be difficult for your Maltipoo to chew.   You can check the ingredients to be sure that the food is high-quality. If meat (not a meat by-product) is one of the first two ingredients, then that dog food is probably high-quality. If not, then look some more. Consult a pet nutrition expert if you plan to make your dog’s food. Dogs have specific nutritional needs that are different from what humans require and it can be hard to meet these needs when making your dog’s food yourself.Talk to your veterinarian for advice if you want to cook your dog’s food yourself.  Your Maltipoo’s diet depends on his weight and activity level. You can find a suggested range on your dog’s food package, but you will also need to take your dog’s activity level into account when determining how much to feed your Maltipoo.   For example, your dog’s food package might recommend ½ to one cup of food per day. If your Maltipoo is very active, then he will probably need the higher amount of one full cup of food each day. If your Maltipoo is not active, then he may only need ½ of a cup of food each day.  Free-feeding is when you leave out a large amount of dry food and allow your dog to eat what he wants whenever he feels like it. This method of feeding is convenient, but it can also cause your dog to become overweight or obese. That is why it is better to give your Maltipoo measured portions at specific times each day.Most adult dogs do best if fed twice per day, so you can divide your dog’s total daily intake into two portions and give one in the morning and the other in the evening. To determine how much to feed your Maltipoo at each meal, you will need to divide his total daily food intake in half. For example, if your Maltipoo is supposed to have one cup of food every day, then you could give ½ cup in the morning and a ½ cup in the evening.  Adult dogs do well with two meals per day, but your dog may need to be fed more than twice per day if he is still a puppy. If your puppy is:   eight to 12 weeks, then divide his food into four portions three to six months, then divide his food into three portions six months to one year old, then divide his food into two portions, Treats are a nice way to reward your dog for being good, but the calories can add up and lead to weight gain. To prevent your dog from taking in too many excess calories, try offering:   blueberries watermelon chunks banana slices cooked sweet potato slices broccoli baby carrots cooked green beans, Maltipoos can also get sick from some foods, so it is important to monitor your Maltipoo’s diet as well. Foods that you should never give your Maltipoo include:caffeine onions, garlic, and chives avocados chocolate grapes and raisins nuts alcohol yeast xylitol, Like all dogs, Maltipoos need to have access to a bowl of clean, fresh water at all times.Ceramic or stainless steel bowls are ideal because they do not hold onto as much bacteria as plastic and your Maltipoo cannot chew on them.   Make sure that you change your Maltipoo’s water every day and replenish it often.  

select a high-quality small breed dog food.  figure out how much to feed your maltipoo.  develop a regular feeding schedule.  consider your dog’s age.  give your maltipoo some healthy treats.  prevent your maltipoo from eating toxic human foods.  provide your maltipoo with plenty of clean, fresh water. 

, For example, if you are designing a structure, you can imagine walking through it, and imagining what it would look like once it is built, with people moving around it giving you a guided tour.  This allows you to notice any possible things or problems that may need to be changed in your design that may have slipped past unnoticed.   Alternatively, if you are dealing with a problem in the office, you can imagine sitting down and talking to that person and see what feelings come up. This helps you to interact better with them in real life as well as to allow deeper solutions your mind may offer to come to the surface. This method actually has an enormous scope as it can easily be used for any challenge or new design idea to come forward. It helps build a high degree of confidence in the practitioner because they have more tools in their box when it comes to making new innovations, or solving difficult challenges.  

settle in with the relaxation method above.  ,  allow your mind to reflect on any work or project you are doing at the moment.  feel inspired with what you plan to build and ask yourself if it can be made more intelligently. 

 They should be about hip's distance apart, as if you're walking as you normally would. The airwalk is all about your feet, so you don't have to worry about what to do with your arms or the rest of your body quite yet. If you've never tried this before, some people recommend that you sit with your feet apart to master the movements of your feet before standing.   To get a stronger sense of what your feet are doing, you can practice in front of a mirror or even film yourself or ask a friend to watch you.; , Let the foot hover there straight, without pointing your toes, at about a 45 degree angle from the ground, with your toes above your heel. Lift the foot up in the air, with your toes leading, as if you were stepping over a barrier that is about half a foot tall, except that your foot won't hit the ground when you step over it and will pull back instead.  Your legs should be straight and you shouldn't bend your knees at all when you do this. Just glide the foot back to where it started, with the heel dragging it back until it naturally touches the ground. Think of it as rocking your weight forward before you transition to the other foot.  When you do the airwalk, you should never have both feet be flat on the ground at the same time. When one foot is moving back, the other should be preparing to move forward. It can take a little while to get into the rhythm. Just remember what we said about it being like riding a bicycle — when you're riding a bike, your feet are always in constant motion, too. If you stop one of them, then you'll stall.  Now, just do what you did with the other foot — lift your other foot forward, with the toe leading, as if you were stepping over a short barrier, and then drag it back, as if a string were attached to your heel and was slowly dragging it back. As the forward foot moves back, the other foot should prepare to move forward by lifting up on its toes.  Just keep doing the airwalk by raising one foot at a time and moving forward for as long as you like. You can start by practicing in place and then slowly moving forward, so you're moving forward at a much slower pace than you would if you were walking, as if you're walking on air or are having to move forward in a low-gravity situation.   When you move forward, try to form a "V" shape with your feet as they transition. So, when the foot that is up in the air moves back to meet the other, the heel of that foot should land where the toe of the other foot is pointed, so they create a "V" together as the pointed foot moves forward, and so on. This will keep you moving forward at the same pace.  It can take some practice to get this move down, but it'll be worth it. It can also be easier to learn the moonwalk first, before you get the airwalk down, since some people think the airwalk is a little bit trickier. Once you master the airwalk, you can work on airwalking and then transitioning to the moonwalk and back to the airwalk again. You can also work on gliding, which will use somewhat similar techniques, except you'll be moving from side to side.   As you get more comfortable with the airwalk, you can wave your shoulders a bit, and get your arms into it. Just move your arms forward and back, just as you would if you were walking forward normally, except at a slower pace to sync up with your feet. Remember to keep the movement as fluid as possible, so it looks like you're walking on air.  Once you've got the airwalk down, you can add this small variation to make the movement more interesting. All you have to do is take the foot that is pointed on its toes, ready to move forward, move it forward, tap its toes on the ground, and then do the normal airwalking move, where the foot moves forward with the toes leading up above the heel. Then, move the foot back and do the same with the other foot, tapping its toes on the ground in front of it before it also moves forward.  Another thing you can do is to tap the heel of each foot, and then its toe, before you take a step forward. If you've mastered being able to tap each toe once before you move forward, then you should be able to tap the heel and then the toe of each foot as it takes a step without a problem. Watch yourself in the mirror to make sure that you've got the rhythm down.  Once you become a master at the airwalk, you can work on walking forward for about thirty seconds or so, and then transitioning into the moonwalk, so you walk backwards to the place where you started. Then you can go right back into the airwalk, moving forward again, and then move backward using the moonwalk whenever you feel like it.   The trickiest part will be the transition, and you have to work on not stalling or stopping, but transitioning right from moving forward to moving backward, and vice versa.  

stand with your feet side by side.  move one foot straight in the air in front of the other foot.  as your weight transfers to the toes of that foot, glide it back to its original position.  when the first foot moves back to its original position, the other foot should point up on its toes.  move the other foot up and forward and repeat.  keep moving forward.  practice.  tap your toes with each step.  tap your heel and toe with each step.  do the airwalk along with the moonwalk. 

 You should fold your sweaters and store them in drawers rather than hanging them. Hanging sweaters can stretch out portions of the sweater. It can also leave small humps at the shoulders. If possible, fold your sweaters rather than hanging them., If you need to hang your sweaters, take certain precautions. Use thick, padded hangers to provide more support. This can help prevent stretching. You may also want to fold your sweater over and hang it from the bottom bar of a hanger. The bottom bar may provide more support, preventing stretching.You can cut open an empty paper towel tube and then fit it over the bottom bar of a hanger. This may help prevent creasing., If possible, you should always hand wash your sweaters. Hand wash them in cold water with a small amount of fabric softener and detergent. Rinse thoroughly, making sure to get all the suds out. When removing excess water before drying, press the sweater. Do not squeeze or wring it. Fold the sweater in half and hang it over the bottom bar of a hanger on a drying rack to dry.

 Shopping in retail stores can be difficult and uncomfortable at times. You can get the look and feel of the garment you are selecting for your sweetheart but you may be the nervous type and wind up selecting the wrong item. Sometimes salespeople will approach you and tempt you into buying something that may be inappropriate for your relationship. Online lingerie stores are the best, easiest and safest place to shop. Your purchase there is discreet and confidential and can be returned. Just be sure the store has a return policy that is acceptable to you.; , First, be sure the site you purchase from has sizing charts so that you can match that to her. You will need to do some investigation to figure out her correct size. Also, remember that all manufacturers sizing runs differently so be sure to email them if you are not sure. A good seller of intimates will quickly respond to questions and if they don’t then don’t expect them to ship promptly. When picking a size choose something on the smaller side rather than larger. It is better for your purchase to be too tight on her rather too loose. This could change the mood of the occasion very quickly !! Check out her underwear drawer and examine the labels. Garments are labeled, XXS, XS ,S, M, L, XL, 1X, 2X, 3X. Others are labeled size 0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18 …..and bra sizes are go by the back size (the number) and the cup size (the letter). There is a huge variation of sizes, you can get a AAA 28 all the up to a size DDD 40! Sizes in most retailers usually go from around A 32 - DD 38.  Think about what excites both of you and choose something that will be erotic and turn you both on. Sexy intimates offer many choices so take your time when choosing style and website. When considering the style, think about your relationship and how intimate you are and how long you have been together. You can then choose something that is casual and on the safe side such as lace, satin or silk. Or, select something more risky such as leather, Lycra, PVC or vinyl. Be careful, PVC is great for the right occasion but only fits well on true sized people. This is also true for leather so be cautious when choosing this type of material. These types of outfits sometimes are better discussed in advance before purchasing. You want your lady to feel comfortable with your purchase so it is important that is pleases both of you.  Choose garter belts for the taller woman or corset types of outfits. Garters belts will make her legs go on forever! Also, a body stocking may be a fun choice (make sure it has an open crotch for convenience). For the larger woman a baby-doll may be a good choice. Baby-doll are fitted around the bra area so go by bra size.  These choices are simple. Most women can wear red, white or black but try to match her hair color. Blondes look good in pastels and great in black. Brunettes need rich blues and reds. Redheads look good in green, blue and earthy tones. Skin tone is also an important factor. For darker skin, go for a lighter color lingerie. Pale skin tones look better in darker colors.  

decide where to shop.  know her size.  choose a style.  take her body type into account.  choose a color. 

 You need to compile all your paperwork before attempting to setup a proper system. Go through all locations you may have paperwork and place them all in one pile. Spend time to make sure you can properly account for all active and inactive work you have.   Plan ahead of time by clearing a table space to work on your papers. If you are adapting someone else’s paperwork into a new filing system, remove all documents from the current system. It will be better for you to handle all documents and prepare for a new system.; , This is the hard part of the process, but it is also a crucial step to becoming organized. It may seem tedious, but go through each document in your pile to determine what you’re working with.   You don’t need to read each paper, but a brief skim will help you out. Post-it notes are good for marking important papers you know you’ll need to spend time on., As you start to sort through your paperwork, it would be helpful to keep related papers together. You could place all papers relating to the “Nickelback” client in one pile. Another example is to pile your work based on months.   Having a sense of chronological order could be useful for your filing needs. Set priorities while sorting through paperwork. When you see papers that are exceptionally important, place them on the top of their respective pile.  Another pile you can create is the trash pile. You aren’t required to throw away a pile of your paperwork, but you should separate the unimportant papers from the other piles. You could even set up a miscellaneous pile where random papers could go.   If you are 100% sure that you don’t need some paperwork and you cannot draw a viable link to other document, discard them. Check with your superiors if you’re allowed to throw away anything before following through with something., Keep things simple for yourself by using cheap manila folders. This won’t hurt your funds and will allow you to carry out any filing system you’d like. You can get a pack of manila folders from any office supply store.  Use the piles you established earlier to act as a guide for your folders. Ensure that the contents of each folder are organized as well. You can either organize a file’s contents based on each paper’s importance or by chronology.   Avoid arranging a file’s contents based off the alphabet. Alphabetical organization works more efficiently for organizing groups of files. Place the manila folders into a filing cabinet as you fill the folders. 

gather all your materials.  go through all the documents.  set up piles.  reduce as you see fit.  use manila folders.  transfer your piles. 

 Children who describe vague symptoms that move from one body part to another without discretion are often faking. If, on the other hand, his symptoms are concrete and typically go together—like a runny nose and a sore throat, or stomach pain and diarrhea—that’s not a red flag.; , Don’t leave the room after handing your child the thermometer. Many a child have gotten out of going to school by running the thermometer under the hot tap or holding it up to a hot lightbulb.  If your child says she’s been throwing up, you will probably be able to hear and see it.  Does your child look pale and clammy? Clammy skin is caused by a number of factors, including allergic reaction, severe pain, anxiety, dehydration, and pneumonia., Sometimes children complain of a belly ache. If she won’t let you touch her tummy and refuses to eat or drink, she may be having abdominal pain.Abdominal pain can be caused by constipation, viral infections, and occasionally something more serious. Call your doctor if your child has prolonged abdominal pain.  If they look red, pink, or watery, ask him if they are bothering him. While it could just be allergies, if it looks crusty it might be Pink Eye.   If your child has Pink Eye, take him to the doctor. This viral infection can be very contagious., Even those children who don’t like doctors or medicine will agree to do whatever they need to in order to feel better. If your child refuses care, it’s probably because he doesn’t need it!  , If she went from droopy-eyed to bright-eyed, she may be looking for a day catching up on “Arthur.”   Keep an ear out for any mention of homework. If she squeals with delight at the thought of not having to do any today, this might be a sign that she is trying to avoid something.  Don’t incentivize staying home. If staying home sick means special treats and a day of television, she won’t mind falling behind in school. Sick days are meant for resting and recuperating, which can include watching television. However if your child is extremely alert while watching T.V., instead of lying on the couch and watching through squinting, resting eyes, he may have another motive.  So you said he could stay home, and after twenty minutes of extra sleep he’s playing with LEGO and running around. He may have fooled you once, but he won’t fool you again.  Take note if your child conveniently gets sick on the day of the US Constitution test. If she didn’t study enough she might be trying for an extra day to cram.   If she’s extremely nervous about a presentation or test, she might actually feel physically sick. Help her to pinpoint what she’s nervous about and brainstorm solutions with her. Younger kids don’t have the self-awareness to say, “I’m feeling anxious today.”Tell them it’s normal to feel scared, and see if you can help them through their fear., Some kids really don’t click with their teachers. If your child is faking sick to avoid his teachers, this could become a pattern.   If this is the case, you will need to speak directly with your child’s teacher to resolve the issue. Find out if other students are having a hard time with this particular teacher. If not, it may be a specific to your child’s learning style or personality.  Approximately 30 percent of students in grades 6-10 are affected by bullying. Understandably, those affected by it may choose to fake sick in order to bypass the jeering. , If it seems that every Tuesday and Thursday—gym day—little Samuel comes down with a vague leg cramp, it’s probably OK to send him to school.   If you honestly can’t tell and it hasn’t been a pattern, go with your gut. If your child really is sick, the school will send him home anyway.  You should not send your child to school if she has a temperature above 100.4 Fahrenheit, vomiting, diarrhea, persistent pain or a bad, wet cough. This is not only for your child’s health, but for the health of her teachers and classmates.  It’s hard to believe that kids get stressed, but they do! Sometimes the weekend isn’t enough time for them to catch up, especially if they are weighed down with projects.   Unexplained symptoms could be a sign of something else. Anxiety, depression, or other issues can sometimes manifest themselves in physical ways. 

ask what symptoms the child has.  check his temperature.  listen for the sound of vomiting and check for the smell for vomit.  look for clammy skin.  ask if you can touch her tummy.  check his eyes.  suggest going to the doctor or taking medicine.  notice if your child appears excited to stay home.  restrict your child’s activities.  notice if he has increased energy later in the day.  ask your child what would be going on in school today.  see if your child is getting along with his teachers.  find out if your child is being bullied.  consider if this is becoming a pattern.  keep him home from school if he has tangible symptoms.  recognize that everyone needs a break sometimes. 

 You may have to do a bit of digging before finding a proxy that hasn’t already been blocked by your school. A web search for “web proxies” will lead to all sorts of options. If your school blocks sites that list proxies, use a network outside of your school to make a list of several web proxy sites to try. Proxy.org is a great site to find a current list of web proxies.   Using a web proxy will help you get around web filters but won’t affect your other apps. If you’re trying to use an app that your school has blocked, you’ll have better luck with a VPN. Web proxies can be a bit slow, so be patient while things load.; , In your browser, navigate to the web proxy and look for the box that asks for a URL or web address. It will be near the top of the screen. Enter the address of any site you’d like to visit.  As long as you do your browsing through the web proxy website (not another tab or browser window), you’ll be able to access the sites blocked by your school.  

find a web proxy that works.  open the web proxy on your device.  enjoy unfiltered access to the internet. 

 Once bitten, you should clean the wound thoroughly with a lot of soap and water as soon as possible. Washing the bite right away will lower the chance of infection. Rabies is passed through the saliva of an infected animal, and if you are bitten by such an animal, the virus could enter your body through the bite.Rinse the bite with clean water and apply several applications of soap to the wound. Rinsing the bite will lower your chances of actually becoming infected because you will rinse out the virus before it has a chance to move any further into your body.; , Pour or dab some disinfectant onto the wound. The disinfectant will work to kill off the virus before it can infect the person who has been bitten.  If the animal's saliva touched any other part of the person’s body who got bit, it is very important to wash that area with soap and water.Most importantly, wash the eyes, nose, and mouth if they came into contact with the animal’s saliva, as in some cases, the virus can pass through the mucus membrane of a person’s eye, nose, or mouth.  After you have thoroughly rinsed the bite, take the person to the hospital right away. Once there, tell the nurse and doctor exactly what happened so that proper treatment can begin right away.  

clean the bitten area and bite very thoroughly with water and soap.  use a disinfectant like povidone-iodine if you have any disinfectant on hand.  wash any area of the body that was exposed to the saliva of the infected animal.  take the bitten person to the hospital immediately after cleaning the wound. 

 By listening through a wall, you are about to spy on another person and violate private conversations. This raises big legal and ethical problems. Before acting, seriously ask yourself if you want to do it. Is it worth the risk?   The situation is important. In England, for instance, a man rescued his elderly neighbor from a robbery by listening through the wall with a glass.In his situation, spying was definitely justified. Things are rarely so clear cut, however. You should probably not act if you have any doubts about the situation. If you decide to go ahead, make sure that you know the possible consequences of your actions.  Eavesdropping means to overhear, record, magnify, or transmit any part of a private conversation without the consent of at least one person involved. Be aware that states have laws against eavesdropping. By spying you may well be breaking the law; you might even be violating the law by possessing a device for spying.Your state may have a “one party consent” or “two party consent” law. One party consent means that it is illegal to eavesdrop unless you have the consent of at least one of the people engaged in a private conversation. In two party consent you must have permission from both parties to listen, record, or amplify their communication.Take the state of Michigan. Michigan has a two party consent law – you must have permission from all parties in order to “overhear, record, amplify, or transmit any part of a private discourse.” This applies even in your own home. Eavesdropping there is also a felony., What happens if you eavesdrop and someone finds out? What could happen to you? This is a good question and you should consider all of the possible outcomes, which in many cases are severe.   In Michigan, the penalties for illegal eavesdropping are up to 2 years in prison, up to $2,000 in fines, or both.In California, eavesdropping is either a misdemeanor or felony. As a misdemeanor you face up to 364 days in jail and a $2,500 fine; as a felony, you could spend up to three years in prison and a $2,500 fine.Of course, a criminal penalty is not the only bad outcome. You also open yourself to a civil lawsuit for violating someone’s privacy, which could be costly and run into the thousands of dollars. Even if you escape legal consequences, you could have a very angry person on your hands.  

ask yourself: do you really want or need to spy?,  be aware of eavesdropping laws.  consider all negative consequences. 

 The best areas for building a tarp shelter are places that have flat ground. This can make creating the shelter a bit easier and will allow you a more comfortable place to sleep in. Take some time to find a nice, flat area before building your tarp shelter., Once you've found a nice place on the ground for your shelter, you will want to look above it. Dead branches can pose a serious hazard to campers if they are knocked down by wind. Always avoid placing your shelter under any branches that look old, dead, or dangerous to avoid having one fall on you., Many tarp shelter designs require you to place a sturdy cord or rope between two trees. This cord will act as the ridge-line for your tarp shelter. It's a good idea to look for a flat spot that has two trees for you to place this cord between.If you can't find two trees, you could try placing two anchor branches in the ground instead. These trees should be roughly as far apart as your tarp is long.  Although it may be sunny and dry when you set your tarp shelter up, the weather may change during your camping trip. It's important to consider what the weather might do in the near future, allowing you to stay comfortable and avoid any damage to your tarp shelter.Figure out which way the winds are blowing. Any “wall” of your tarp shelter should face away from the wind. Avoid putting your shelter in any areas that are low or seem like they could flood during rain storms.  

find a flat area.  look above for dead branches.  look for trees you can use.  consider the weather. 

 Wait until the potatoes are cooked, rinse them under cold water, and then drain the water. Place the potatoes on the side. When they're cooled, cut them in half.; , Drain the beans and refresh them in water. Drain again and place the beans on the side.  Slowly add the olive oil to the mixture while whisking.  Take a big bowl and add the lettuce, potatoes, artichoke hearts, green beans, tomato wedges and olives. Drizzle the vinaigrette on the top. Dress the salad with basil and parsley. Season with salt and lightly toss everything together.  Garnish the salad with hard boiled eggs and chopped tuna. 

simmer the potatoes in a saucepan filled about halfway full with saltwater.  trim the ends off of the beans and place them in a saucepan of boiling, salted water for about 2 to 3 minutes.  get a bowl and mix the garlic, balsamic vinegar, salt, mustard, and pepper together.  create your salad.  serve the salad on a serving plate. 

 An 8 megapixel phone camera or better will get the job done well.; , Find a place find a place with good lighting. Somewhere outside, a room with lots of windows, or a room with good lights. Avoid dark rooms or rooms with a single light source.  You should probably place the camera at or above shoulder height. If you are filming a stationary video, a good shot typically has the character's shoulders near the middle and their waist or knees at the bottom. ALWAYS do a short test video before recording the content. If you want to get fancy add multiple cameras each recording from different sides.  If you’re speaking about a subject know what your talking about. If its an actual speech create a script with bullet points. Practice recording to get the hang of being loud and not stuttering. Unless you’re a gifted speaker you’re going to mess up.  Act like you’re talking to someone. Don’t read of your script, just hit the main points. Don't stare at the camera, or any individual object. Even if you stay facing the camera, shift your weight, use limited hand gestures, speak with more than monotone, and use your face to reinforce your words. If possible add jokes, even if they are corny.  If it is on a phone, upload it to YouTube. You will need a Google or Gmail account to upload, but it is easy (and free) to sign up. You can make the videos private or public if you want to keep it to yourself or share. If your phone/camera isn't able to, then copy it to your computer and edit it.  This works best on Google Chrome (browser). Google search “youtube editor”, login, and then you can choose any videos you’ve uploaded. You can learn how to edit from this feature at How to Use YouTube's Video Editor  , Unless there is unbroken dialogue, or a scene that must be all one piece, chop it up. Change your shot every 1-10 seconds. This may sound extreme but is very important. Use this to cut out any errors or content-lacking spots in your video.  Do not use flipping, rotating, spinning, shattering, melting, zooming, or otherwise obnoxious animations. While they may look cool they will not make your video look cool. The best transitions to use are fading to black (on YouTube choose color fade -> black) or no transitions (also called a hard transition). Also other ones that can be used are; fading to white, cross blur, cross fade, and wipe.  Judge if your video needs to be brighter or dimmer, rotated, stabilized, or have muted audio for certain clips. If so these options can all be done on the YouTube editor.  You can choose if everyone can see it, or if only people with a link can see it, or if only you can see it. If you want a copy of your video, choose the “unlisted” option and then use one of the many YouTube downloaders to get in on your computer.  

find a good camera.  pick a good location.  get a good angle.  speak clearly.  be alive!,  transfer for editing.  edit on youtube.  make short clips.  use simple transitions.  add effects and filters.  publish your video! 

 Understanding the perspectives of various disabled people can help you understand what they want, feel, and need.   There is a strong autistic community presence online, where you can learn more about autism (which includes Asperger Syndrome).; ,   Autistic people are not necessarily savant-like, sleepwalking through life, unfeeling, or suffering deeply. A developmental disability does not always mean an intellectual disability. While they can co-occur, don't assume that being nonspeaking or flapping one's hands means that someone is less intelligent than you.  Each disabled person has a unique personality and set of abilities. Recognize that your friend might not meet every diagnostic criterion to the letter, and their experiences may differ from other people who have the same ability.   If you've met one disabled person, you've met one disabled person. Don't assume that your friend with ADHD will be just like your four-year-old cousin with ADHD. For example, one might have a tendency to think that anyone who as much as greets them wants to be their friend while another might have a tendency to misread rudeness into subtle negative feelings such as disappointment or annoyance.  

read a bit about the disability, and the disability community.  push aside stereotypes and misinformation.  recognize that your friend is an individual, with their own talents and challenges. 

 Lay a towel flat. Place the Lycra item in the center of the towel. Next, fold the edges up over the clothing. Roll up the clothing. Gently squeeze out excess water, then lay the towel and clothing flat again., Heat and direct sunlight are damaging to the stretchy Lycra fibers. To keep your clothing fresh, pick a safe area. Find an out of the way area where you can lay out a towel.Hang drying is a quicker alternative, but the water pulling downwards will stretch out the Lycra over time. Avoid using an iron on full Lycra clothing. On Lycra blends, if you still want to risk ironing, use as low a heat setting as possible.  Set the laundry bag filled with Lycra items in the dryer. The heat of a dryer can be harmful to the stretch of the fabric, so pick the lowest heat setting you can find. Pick the delicates setting, if your machine has it, or a low heat tumble dry.Air drying is the better alternative. Machine dry only when you’re short on time. Don’t use fabric softener when Lycra is being dried.  

roll the lycra up in a towel.  air dry away from direct sunlight.  machine dry the clothing on a low heat setting. 

 Wrap a hair tie around your wrist and pull your hair up into a high ponytail. Hold your hair with the hand that has the hair tie on it. Use your other hand to slip the hair tie off and wrap it 2 to 3 times around your ponytail.          Use a brush or comb to get it as smooth as possible. Use a hair tie that matches your hair color.; , This is not completely necessary for the style, but it could help hide the elastic and give you a fancier look. Take a thin section of hair from the ponytail and wrap it around the base to hide the elastic. Secure the strand with a bobby pin.         Use a bobby pin that closely matches your hair color.  Take the section from the top-left corner of your ponytail, right where the elastic is. The section should be no thicker than your finger. It will become thicker as you add hair to it.          You can grab the section from the right side instead if you prefer. You will need to reverse the sides for each step in this method, however.  Divide the section into three thinner sections. Cross the right section over the middle one. Cross the left section over the new middle section.Stop.  Grab a thin strand of hair from the right side of your ponytail, right under the elastic. Bring it across the front of the ponytail, and add it to the right strand.Your right strand should now be thicker.          Keep the strand loose. You don't want it to pull too tightly against the ponytail, or your lace will be crooked.  Make sure that you are crossing the entire right section—with the extra strand added to it. Do not let any hairs escape.         This technique is similar to French braiding.  Cross the left section over the middle one. Add some more hair to the right section, and cross it over the middle section. You can braid as far down as you'd like, or until you run out of hair.         Consider braiding as normal for the last couple of inches.Keep the tension loose as you add the strands to the braid. This will help keep the lacing straight. If you don't, the laced braid will end up crooked., Use a clear hair tie or one that matches your hair color. Do not use a regular-sized hair tie, as this will create too much bulk. Only wrap the hair tie around the braid, and not the rest of the ponytail.          If you braided your hair all the way down, secure the hair tie around the braid and the ponytail.If you braided your hair only partway, secure the hair tie around just the braid itself., This is not completely needed, but it will give your laced ponytail a nicer finish. Choose a bobby pin that matches your hair color, and slide it through the top of the braid, right into the ponytail. 

pull your hair up into high ponytail.  consider wrapping a strand of hair around the elastic.  grab a small section of hair from the left side of your ponytail.  braid the thin section twice.  add a thin strand of hair to the right strand.  cross the thicker right section over the middle section.  continue lace braiding your hair.  secure the braid with a small hair tie.  secure the braid to the top of the ponytail, if desired. 

 Kids need to be able to stay on their feet while they run fast, and speed requires balance.   Utilize drills such as standing or jumping on one foot at a time to increase balance.; , Their brains have to coordinate a lot of movements when they run.   Practice running. Before you concentrate on the speed, make sure kids know how to run properly, with good posture and relaxed limbs. You don't want them to look at their feet while they run, or valuable oxygen will be lost. Kids are also prone to squeezing their fists, which takes blood away from the heart and lungs. Build speed and intensity as the children master the skill of running. Use running drills or encourage them to race each other.  These are ladders you lay on the ground for children to step through as they run. It will increase good form and proper running technique.   Let kids practice their speed. If they kick the agility ladder or stumble, have them start over until they can get through it smoothly. Once they are able to master that, they can work on getting through it faster.  Running fast is a skill and kids will only run faster if they practice and develop a consistent pace of improvement.   Develop a schedule. Have your kids run every day at a specific time, in a specific place.  Too much intensity can cause injuries or lead the kids to lose interest in running. Recovering from a daily run is just as important for speed as the running itself.  In order to run fast, kids will have to have a strong and stable core. Make sure general strength conditioning is part of any running program.   Instruct kids to do sit-ups, push-ups and other conditioning. This will strengthen their entire muscular system, enabling them to run faster.  

promote balance.  teach kids to understand coordination.  incorporate equipment such as agility ladders.  practice running consistently to build speed.  resist overtraining.  condition muscles. 

 Trusts have many benefits over wills, not the least of which is that they tend to be easier to change than wills are. If you anticipate having to change your will many times over your lifetime, a trust might be better suited to your purposes.Another benefit of a trust is that your loved ones will not have to go through probate when you die. Since all your assets are already being held by the trust, your successor trustee simply transfers those assets to the beneficiaries you've named. You also have the benefit of privacy. While a will must be entered into the probate court, where it becomes a public record, a trust doesn't have to be recorded with the probate court or any government agency.  If you have a will but have decided you'd rather replace it with a trust, you may want to consider talking the matter over with an estate planning attorney before you go forward.Particularly if you had an attorney draw up your original will, they probably will be willing to offer you some advice on whether a trust would work for you. If you didn't use an attorney to draw up your original will, look for a reputable estate planning attorney in your area. You may be able to get a recommendation from a friend or family member. You also can find estate planning attorneys by searching the directory on the website of your state or local bar association's website. If you find attorneys who provide free initial consultations, you may want to talk to two or three different attorneys so you can get several opinions. This will allow you to appropriately consider all the estate planning options available to you. #Decide what type of trust you want. Generally, you can create a revocable trust or an irrevocable trust. Ask an estate planning attorney to explain which would be best for your particular estate.Revocable trusts can be changed, or ended, at any point during your life. If you make an irrevocable trust, however, you won't be able to end the trust entirely – at least not without going to a lot of trouble. If you're married, you also should consider whether you want an individual or joint trust. A joint or shared trust is probably a better idea if you and your spouse own a lot of property together. Keep in mind that a joint trust can dispose of both shared and individual assets.  Since you've already executed a will, you can use that as a guide when you list the assets you want to include in your trust. Then you can use this list to help you decide how you want to distribute those assets.Typically, anything that would go through probate is something you want to include in your trust – particularly if one of the main reasons you're creating a trust is to avoid probate. However, you don't necessarily want to have all of your property in your trust. For example, if you have retirement or investment accounts that already allow you to designate a beneficiary, including those in your trust can cause potential confusion by adding unnecessary complication. Go ahead and gather paperwork, such as account statements, deeds, and titles for the assets you want to include in your trust. Once you've signed your declaration of trust you'll need to transfer those assets from yourself into the name of the trust.  Although you may have consulted an attorney earlier, you typically won't need an attorney to draft your declaration of trust for you. This is particularly true if you have a relatively simple estate with few assets.You can find forms or templates online that you can use to draft your declaration of trust yourself. Just make sure the form you choose has been approved for use in your state. If you want an attorney to prepare these documents for you, expect to pay at least $1,000. However, if you feel comfortable doing them yourself you typically won't spend more than $100. You also may be able to get an attorney to look over the document once you've finished drafting it to check for errors. This shouldn't cost you more than a couple hundred dollars.  The declaration of trust is the trust document that is roughly equivalent to the will you've decided to replace. The language may seem similar, but there are some aspects of a trust that aren't present in a will.For example, with a living trust, you're going to list yourself both as the grantor – the person creating the trust – and as the trustee. You'll remain trustee as long as you're alive. You'll have to name a successor trustee to take over after you die. Most people name their spouse or an adult child. You may want to use the same person you'd named as executor of your will. The declaration also establishes the responsibilities of the trustee and successor trustee. If you're using a form, this language will already be included. Just give it a careful read-through and make sure you understand what it's saying. After this, you'll list the beneficiaries of the trust, and the property included in your trust. You may want to create a separate document called a "schedule of property" so you can add or remove assets from the trust at any time without drafting a new declaration.  Once you've completed your documents, look over them carefully to make sure everything is correct, all names are spelled correctly, and there aren't any typos or other errors.The signing procedures for a trust generally aren't as formal as those for a will, but they do vary from state to state. You may be able to tell whether witnesses or a notary is required by looking at the form you used that was approved for use in your state. Otherwise, you may want to ask an attorney. In most states, you must sign your declaration of trust in the presence of a notary. You don't typically need other witnesses like you would if you were executing a will. After signing your declaration, make several copies of it. Then gather the documents you had for the assets in the trust and begin the processing of switching those assets over into the name of the trust.  

evaluate the benefits of a trust.  consult an estate planning attorney.  make a list of your assets.  find a form or template.  draft your declaration of trust.  sign your declaration of trust. 

 Dye your hair warm blonde or sport a wig. The higher quality of your dye or wig, the more convincing your cosplay as Elle will be. Curl the ends of your hair softly to achieve that feminine sweetness. Change your hairstyle frequently.; , Even if you're going to the grocery store, deck yourself out. You can layer on some accessories such as celebrity-inspired sunglasses or diva-esque jewelry. This is the chance for you to strut your stuff.   If you wear another color, make sure it matches with the pink in your outfit. You can wear a fabulous pink pantsuit or a tailored pink blazer to look professional yet chic.  Dress the dog in pink to match your outfit!   You may be tempted to set your dog on a vegetarian diet, as Elle does, but under no circumstances should you do this. The verdict is still out on whether dogs are omnivores or carnivores, and there haven't been enough conclusive studies on whether or not a vegetarian diet is good for dogs. It's best to just feed your dog normal dog food and avoid the possible consequences of deviating from a vet-approved diet.  Keep in mind that Elle is a vegetarian. She's also very physically fit, so it's a good idea to exercise regularly. Sign up for gym membership if you haven't.  Never let anyone catch you unpolished when you're Elle.

 This is the reverse of a French braid, where instead of braiding strands over each other you braid them under. It is very simple to do, and instead of the braid sitting under your hair (as with a French braid), it sits as a 3-D section above your hair.  This beautiful style is created by letting strands of hair hang loose from a French braid, similar to the look of a waterfall. When you feel comfortable with your skills in French braiding, take the next step to try a waterfall braid.  This is a small, thin braid that goes from ear-to-ear across your forehead, like a headband. It uses the process of French or Dutch braiding to turn your bangs into a statement piece.  Say what? This is a regular three-strand braid, but each section is pre-braided to create a very intricate, large braid. This style is great with a bohemian headband or pin, or to give the impression of a lot of work when you didn't do much at all!  , This is a pretty braid that looks like a spiraling rope strand, Although it can be a little difficult to master, it is great for leaving down or twirling up into a bun.

 Choose the best possible mode of communication to reach anyone who might be interested. Try multiple channels if possible.  If you are organizing a work group, use company email.        If you are organizing a school group, ask for telephone numbers or emails. Also, research a school LISTSERV to encourage new membership.       If you are hosting a church group, make sure the meeting time is in the church bulletin.       If you are starting a support group, post the information at hospitals, online and in counselor/doctor offices.      ; , Look online and in books for ideas on what topics to choose. If you are leading a work group, get all the research and reports sent out a few days ahead of time so that everyone can be on the same page for the meeting.  Starting and ending meetings require an outspoken person who will keep track of time and any remaining agenda items. Wear a watch and refer back to it occasionally to make sure you are on track.  Announce the start and end time in your communication with group members. Also, consider announcing topics and the time structure so that members can adequately prepare.       One important structure to announce is whether it is an open group and whether the group has “cross-talk.” This means that the group can discuss, rather than just sharing an opinion when it is their turn.  It can be exhausting to lead a group, especially for professional and emotional topics. Get a good night sleep and do some deep breathing techniques before you start the group meeting., Sitting in a circle is a classic approach, because no one is left out. Move chairs into a circle before anyone else arrives.   Avoid a “classroom” approach. If everyone must see you, but can’t see each other, you will be more of an authority figure and have a harder time encouraging discussion between group members.  It is your job to encourage participation without affecting the outcome. If you are an opinionated person, practice holding your tongue in political or opinionated discussions., Keep it brief, but announce your qualifications or interest in the success of the group. Aim to keep the introduction between one and two minutes long.  Groups like Alcoholics Anonymous have steps and traditions that are to be read at the beginning of each meeting. Don’t go overboard with rules, as they might restrict expression in the group.  If there are desired outcomes or agenda points, review them now. Set times if necessary.  If you are leading a small group, you may be able to go around in a circle (Round Robin) so that everyone has a chance to speak. If you are leading a large group, you may need to encourage the raising of hands or free speaking.   Announce the structure of the group before you start, so that everyone has the same expectations.  You are serving as a neutral party, not a teacher.  Avoid asking questions to the group with yes or no answers. If they must be yes/no answers, ask group members to elaborate on why that is the answer., Good follow-up questions include “How does that change the way you feel about X,Y,Z?” and “How do you think that applies to other issues that we are discussing?”  , If you are afraid that the group is too large to encourage adequate participation, small group work is a good way to encourage everyone in a group to interact.  Encourage positive interactions. Thank people for their contributions.   Don’t be critical. Even if your group is created for critiques, criticism should be only give in small doses. Start each comment with positive reinforcement.  Between subjects, encourage people to play a game, watch a related YouTube clip or get up and move around.  It is your job as the group leader to recognize potential arguments and try to move on in a productive way.   Say, “It sounds like we have a difference of opinion.” “Different points of view are encouraged in our group.” “It sounds like you both feel passionate about this.” “It seems that we can agree on X,Y,Z.”  , This is a good way for people to feel joint ownership of a group and its goals.  Ask people to take a questionnaire or discuss changes or issues wit you.  

announce your group.  research possible topics ahead of time.  learn time management skills before you facilitate a group.  mentally prepare yourself for facilitation.  set up an environment that facilitates discussion.  practice neutrality.  introduce yourself.  state the group rules if they are necessary for the function of the group.  announce the purpose of the meeting.  adjust the structure of group discussion based on how many members you have.  don’t fall into “teaching behaviors.” this is when you begin to answer questions, state facts or speak frequently.  ask open-ended questions.  continue with follow-up questions if discussion doesn’t start immediately.  break the group into smaller groups for projects or intimate discussion.  give positive reinforcement.  suggest an energizer activity if you have a long meeting.  deal with disagreements by finding common ground.  encourage other people to lead future discussions.  create an evaluation process. 

 Curing salmon brings out the best in its fishy flavor, and little subtleties like the salmon's fat content and freshness will stand out after the curing process. The fresher and fattier the salmon, the better your gravlax will taste, so choose the highest quality salmon possible.   Check the salmon's labeling. Look for sustainably-sourced salmon that was not previously frozen. It's easier to find this while salmon is in season during the summer months. Salmon that has been frozen and thawed will not taste as good after curing. To make enough for eight servings, get a two-pound salmon filet with the skin still attached. The flesh should be bright orangish-pink and firm. The skin should look bright and shiny, not spotted or damage. Buy the salmon the same day you're planning to start the curing process, if possible. Store it in the refrigerator until you're ready to use it.; , It's increasingly popular to rub alcohol over the fish before coating it in a cure. Using vodka, bourbon, rye or another alcohol is not traditional when it comes to the lox you'd get in a deli for your bagel, but it can add a lot of depth during the curing process. If you wish to use alcohol, you'll only need a few tablespoons, enough to rub over the entire filet before you coat it in the cure., The most basic ingredient of a salmon cure is salt. Salt draws the moisture from the fish's flesh, changing the taste and texture and acting as a natural preservative. Sugar, spices and citrus zest may be added to provide extra flavor. Start with a basic cure the first time you cure salmon, then consider getting creative and adding your favorite spices and alcohol for a different flair the next time around. Use the following ratio of ingredients for one two-pound piece of salmon:   1/2 cup kosher salt (not table salt, which can negatively affect the flavor) 3 tablespoons white sugar 3 tablespoons of the fresh chopped herbs of your choice, like oregano, dill, basil, fennel or a combination 1/2 tablespoon white pepper Optional: 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) lemon zest  , When you're ready to star the curing process, remove the salmon from the refrigerator and rinse it in cool water, then dry it thoroughly with paper towels., The salmon will need to be tightly wrapped in plastic as it cures. Tear off a few large sheets of plastic wrap and place them on a baking sheet. Lay the salmon fillet skin-side down in the center of the plastic.  Gently press into the flesh of the filet with your fingertips to feel for tiny pin bones. They're usually located near the center of the filet. It's important to remove these before curing the salmon, since they'll interfere when it comes time to slice it up. When you come upon a bone, use a needle-nosed plier to pry it from the flesh, taking care not to damage the filet too much as you do so. Discard the bones when you're finished.  Time to apply the alcohol and cure mixture to the salmon to begin the curing process. Use enough to cover the filet on both sides. Err on the side of using too much instead of too little, since you can always rinse off the excess flavoring later.   Rub the salmon with alcohol. Use a tablespoon or two of the alcohol you chose to cover the salmon on both sides. No need to rub it in with pressure; instead, just smooth it over the surface. Apply the cure. Use a spoon to sprinkle a good coating of the cure mix over the entire filet. Flip it over and put more on the other side.  Lift the sides of the plastic wrap and wrap up the salmon so that it's tightly covered with no air holes. You may want to get another piece of plastic wrap to make sure the wrapping is secure.  Place a second baking sheet over the first one. Nest it in so it's sitting directly on top of the salmon. If you don't have a sheet that fits perfectly, find another flat-surfaced pan or dish to do the job. Put a heavy bowl, a brick, or heavy canned goods on top of the entire contraption. This will compress the cure ingredients into the salmon, creating the right conditions for it to cure.  During this time, do nothing to the salmon except wait patiently while it cures. Most chefs recommend three days of refrigeration, though some recipes specify curing for two. It's a matter of taste, so if you prefer salmon that's less salty, go for two instead of three., Remove it from the refrigerator and take off the plastic wrap. Rinse the fish under cool running water, washing away the salt and other cure ingredients. If you skip this step, the fish will taste too salty.  Use a very sharp knife to cut thin horizontal slices from along the top of the salmon (rather than slicing it vertically as you would a steak). Gravlax has a strong flavor, so thinner slices are more palatable. The salmon is now ready to enjoy.   Taste the salmon for flavor. If you find it too salty, give in an extra rinse before continuing to slice it. The classic way to serve gravlax is with a fresh bagel, cream cheese, sliced red onion and capers. It also makes a great topping for salads, pizzas, crostini, pasta and more.  

choose a fat, fresh filet.  choose your alcohol.  mix up a cure.  rinse and dry the salmon.  lay the salmon on several sheets of plastic wrap.  check the salmon for pin bones.  dress the salmon filet.  wrap the salmon tightly.  weight the salmon.  refrigerate the salmon for 72 hours.  unwrap and rinse the fish.  slice the salmon. 

 If washing in a washing machine, make sure the dishes are placed on the uppermost dishwasher rack to avoid exposing the plastic to high temperatures.Rinse and dry before continuing.  Sunlight has a bleaching effect on plastic, and a few hours of exposure can remove stains, and will help deodorize your plastic dishes. Leave your dishes stain side up in front of an open window, or in a suitable outdoor location where sunlight is plentiful. After a few hours, check to see if the stains have lifted., Baking soda and vinegar are convenient options, and are effective at dissolving many common varieties of food stains. Either soak your plastic dishes in a solution of baking soda, vinegar and warm water (roughly 1 tbsp each of baking soda and vinegar for every cup of water) for 1-2 hours, or scrub the dish using a baking soda paste (made by combining a small amount of baking soda with just enough vinegar or water to make it sticky).Alternately, you can use salt and lemon juice, instead of baking soda and vinegar, to create a scrubbing paste. Another common household alternative to baking soda and vinegar is rubbing alcohol, which can be applied via soaking, or simply by scrubbing the alcohol into the affected area of the plastic dish.  These products can be surprisingly effective at lifting stains out of plastic dishes, especially cups and bowls. Simply fill the cup or bowl with water and drop two denture cleaner or antacid tablets inside, and soak overnight before washing and rinsing., Bleach is potent and somewhat hazardous, but is a good last-resort when other approaches have failed to remove stains. Carefully combine bleach and water at a ratio of roughly one part bleach per two parts water, then allow the plastic dishes to soak in the solution for 30 minutes, then thoroughly rinse the dishes. Bleach is a very caustic substance, and you should be sure to wear rubber gloves to protect your hands from contact with it. Also make sure the space you are working in is well ventilated, so that the fumes produced by the bleach are safely dissipated.  

wash dishes thoroughly to ensure that no food remains on their surfaces.  set the dishes in strong sunlight for at least two hours.  try applying a solution of baking soda and vinegar.  try using an oxygenating agent, like denture cleaner or a fizzing antacid tablet.  soak the dishes in a solution of chlorine bleach. 

 It should be relatively close to the bottom of your paper.; , It should be intersecting the first one, and should be right side up.  You can do this by drawing parallel lines next to all of the original lines. Make sure they're parallel.  You can either make it complicated, or just simply erase all the inner lines. But make sure you erase your lines neatly.  Since Israel's national colors are blue and white, these are recommended.  

draw an upside down triangle.  draw another triangle.  draw a border.  erase the inner lines.  color it in. 

 Move the beads to the center of the string.  Pull the thread tight so that the small beads are wrapped around the large bead.  String one small bead onto the right needle.  Thread the right needle through the large bead and pull it tight. , Thread the left needle through the last large bead that was added so that the small beads wrap around the large bead. Pull the thread tight, tie it and cut off any extra length.  Cut another long piece of clear thread and string a needle onto it. Tie the end of this thread to the end of the barrette.  Wrap the thread around the barrette and go through the same bead again to secure the beads to the barrette.  Continue threading the needle through each large bead and wrapping it around the barrette until you have secured the entire length of beads to the barrette. Tie the string and cut off any extra length. Finish by replacing the clasp of the barrette. 

string one large bead onto the right needle followed by four small beads.  thread the right needle back through the large bead.  string one small bead followed by one large bead onto the left needle.  push the small beads against the previously added beads, one on each side.  continue adding beads in this way until you have a long enough length of beads to cover your barrette.  ,  thread four small beads onto the left needle.  remove the clasp on the barrette.  thread the needle through the large bead on the end and pull it tight.  wrap the thread around the barrette, go through the next large bead and pull the thread tight.  finished.  

 Creating a cocktail dress from a saree is easy and quick. If you want to turn a beautiful saree into a unique dress, then you will need:          short, black strapless dress (or a black skirt and tube top) a saree a few safety pins belt or other accessories (optional); , Before you begin wrapping your saree, put on your black, strapless dress (or your skirt and tube top). Make sure that the dress or skirt that you choose does not extend past the middle of your thigh. Otherwise, the saree might not cover it.  Take one corner of your saree and match it up with the corner on the other side of your saree. Make sure that the sides are evenly matched up with each other. Then, pin the corners together.         You should only place a pin at one corner. The other edge will need to remain loose and open for draping purposes.  With one hand, hold the corner of the saree that you pinned against your waist. With the other hand, hold onto the other corner of the saree. Then, begin wrapping the saree around your waist.         You should be able to wrap the saree material around your waist at least twice. Wrap the material as tightly as you can to give your dress a sleek look. A loosely wrapped saree may appear bulky or sloppy.  When you have finished wrapping the material, tie the pinned corner to the other corner of your saree to secure the material in place.You may also pin the corners together if you prefer.          You should now look like you are wearing a full length skirt.  Take the bottom corner of the saree that is on the outside of the skirt, and the corner that is on the inside of the skirt. Then, lift them up towards your right shoulder and tie the two corners in a knot.The loop you have created will help to keep the saree material up, so make sure that it is secure.          You may also pin the corners together, but make sure that you pin them from underneath so that the pin is not visible., Next, take your right arm and put it through the loop you have created. Adjust the loop as needed so that it rests comfortably on your shoulder.          You should now have a one strap dress.  You may need to adjust your saree dress to make sure that it is draped the way you want it to be.You can also use safety pins to secure any parts of the dress that you would like to keep hanging a certain way. Just make sure that the pins are not visible.          If your dress looks too loose, or you don’t like the way it is hanging, then you can always start over.  To finish up your look, add any accessories that you would like.For example, you can put on a belt to cinch the waist, add a brooch to the shoulder area or pair a shrug with your dress.          Avoid wearing sandals or other casual shoes with your saree cocktail dress.Opt for some close toe high heels instead to intensify the cocktail dress look.  

gather your materials.  put on your black dress.  fold your saree in half and pin it at one corner.  wrap your saree around your waist.  tie the inner and outer corner in a knot.  lift up the corners.  put your right arm through the loop.  adjust the drape.  put on a belt and any other accessories you want. 

 Some hairstyles are much harder on the hair and scalp than others, because they pull and can cause breakage. Cornrows, braids, ponytails, top-knots, or buns can all do this, especially if they are worn continuously or too tightly.Choose a style that doesn’t pull or put tension on the shafts of your hair. Too tight ponytails and others can cause traction alopecia on the sides of your head; braids around the hairline can easily cause damage the hair there. If you really like your hair up, at least give it frequent rests. Pick a style that you can let down at the end of the day.; , Hair “enhancements” like weaves and extensions can make your hair fuller and longer in the short term. However, they can also pull at the hair fibers and roots and, over time, contribute to hair loss. Sometimes, this damage is permanent.Prolonged pulling of the roots can cause inflammation and lead to scarring, which may permanently destroy them. Only get weaves and extensions at salons that specialize in such products, and make sure that they are light-weight. Don’t wear weaves or extensions for more than 2 or 3 months at most. Keep up your normal scalp hygiene and switch hair styles periodically. Rest your hair for a few weeks in between hair extension applications., The thing about these products is that they coat the hair and add friction when you comb or brush, all of which increases the risk of breakage.Styling your hair after using a hold product can lead to hair loss over time. Choose an everyday style that doesn’t need styling product, instead, if possible.  Do you color, perm, straighten, or bleach your hair? All of these procedures involve chemicals that erode the integrity of hair fibers and can eventually make your hair dull looking or frizzy or even break off, thinning your hair.Most people should wait 6 to 7 weeks between hair coloring or, in the winter, 8 to 10 weeks. Those with naturally strong hair may be able to go every five weeks. For a perm, wait at least 1 to 2 weeks before repeating.Only have one treatment at a time. If you have a perm, for example, wait at least 2 weeks before coloring your hair. Make sure to do deep conditioning on your hair every few days to help it recover from these chemical processes.  Traction alopecia can be prevented, especially if you recognize it early on. If you think that your hairstyles might be damaging your hair, look out for the following signs:A sense of relief when you untie your hair Tenderness of your scalp An itchy scalp The need to take painkillers because of a headache caused by your hairstyle  , Overheating hair can cause it to become brittle or to crack, split, and break off. It can also strip the hair of moisture, making it dull. You’ll want to avoid over-using heating tools to prevent hair loss, but especially blow dryers and irons.Don’t apply the blow dryer directly to your hair. Direct heat can burn or weaken hair. Limit your use of blow dryers each week, as well. Flat irons and curlers can also damage your hair with heat. Limit your use of them to no more than every other day. Leave irons in place only for a second or two.Never use a tool like this on wet hair, because it can easily burn it. Use irons on dry hair at a low or medium setting.  To avoid the harsh effect of a blow dryer, consider wrapping your head in a towel “turban” to dry. While toweling your hair might seem like a good idea, the friction can actually damage your hair, too. Create a turban with a regular or microfiber head towel, instead – you’ll feel like you’ve just been to the spa.First, pat (don’t rub) your hair dry with the towel. Bend over so that your hair hangs down over your head. Place the towel over the center of the back of your neck and drape it over your hair. Fold the towel around your head and hair and twist the ends of the towel, making sure that the hair is inside. Stand up and bring the twisted end of the towel back over your head. Slip the end under the nape of your neck to secure the turban.  Partially air-dry your hair before you style or comb it. This will help you on two fronts: you’ll end up blow-drying it less, for one. But you’ll also protect your hair from wet styling, when the hair is weaker and more prone to damage.Most people should avoid styling wet hair, as it breaks more easily when brushed or combed. An exception to the rule is people who have kinky or tightly curled hair. For them, brushing the hair when wet will decrease chance of breaks. Just be gentle!  , Over-treatment is the number one cause of hair damage. Pulling too hard at your hair while washing or brushing can put a lot of stress on the hair fibers and strip off the “cuticle,” which is the tough protective outer layer of the hair. Hair with a weakened cuticle will split or break off more often.Don’t brush your hair aggressively. Shampoo and rinse your hair gently, too. You don’t need to worry about washing frequency if you use care, however. Washing your hair more often shouldn’t cause you to lose hair., People used to advise giving your hair 100 strokes a day to make it shine or to boost blood flow to the scalp. Both of these ideas are wrong. In fact, brushing this much will cause split ends, break hair shafts, or even pull it out. You’ll end up with more hair if you’re not so zealous.Brushing causes friction on the hair. Too much of it will make your hair lusterless or frizzy. Brush minimally, maybe once per day, in order to detangle or style.  Something else that can cause friction on your hair and lead to damage is the wrong tool. Using a wide-tooth comb or brush will let you detangle and style your hair gently, without putting too much stress on it.Buy a wide-tooth comb/brush at your local pharmacy or salon. Some are designed specifically for detangling and they usually cost less than $20. You can also try a paddle brush with plastic-tipped bristles. Avoid brushes made from boar’s hair. Natural bristles tend not to be uniform and can be hard on your hair and scalp.  Vitamin E is an antioxidant and potent moisturizer, so it can help reduce inflammation from hair follicles and promote circulation that will improve the growth of your hair.  Hair loss can be a result of weak hair, which itself may result from a poor diet or lack of certain vitamins. To strengthen your hair, make sure that you are getting all the necessary nutrients and eat well.Include fatty fish like salmon in your diet, for example. Salmon contains omega 3 fatty acids, which your body needs to grow hair and keep it full and shiny. Make sure to eat protein, too, the basic building block of hair. Try yoghurt, nuts, and lean meats like chicken. Leafy greens can also help your hair, as they contain needed nutrients like vitamin A and C, plus beta carotene and folate. Get enough iron, as well, from things like grains, lentils, beef, and organ meats. Iron deficiency can lead to hair loss. Finally, condition, condition, condition. Use conditioner after every shampoo to keep your hair strong.  

avoid styles that pull the hair.  avoid weaves and hair extensions.  go “no-hold.” another pitfall for hair loss is using styling products for long-lasting hold, like certain kinds of gels and hairsprays.  go easy on chemical treatments.  know the signs of damaging traction.  minimize your use of hair-dryers and other heating tools.  wrap your hair with a towel to dry.  air-dry your hair before combing or brushing.  wash and brush your hair gently.  keep brushing to a minimum.  use a wide-tooth brush or comb.  use products with vitamin e. buy topical products that include vitamin e; you can find shampoos, conditioners, and lotions available online or in stores.  strengthen your hair. 

 Touch his or her shoulder or hand when you make a point ("It's really cool" or "You should try it," etc.). Not only are you reinforcing what you're saying, your also giving them an excuse to start touching you back!; , If you already did some physical flirting, encourage him/her to touch you as well. Play a game like thumb wrestling, put an arm on his or her shoulder, and open up. Be creative. If he or she will smile, the person probably likes it and may want you to do it again. And when he/she touches you back in a sensual way, you are in!   If you're a guy, give the girl a piggyback ride. It's a good way to get close to her and show her how strong you are. Try not to move too fast or you could fall, which would not be encouraging. When the other person teases you, gently "hit" them on the shoulder. Mostly, girls do this when guys are playfully teasing them. Be careful doing this if you're a guy.  Hang your arm around the person a little when telling a joke or laughing. When you're telling a joke or he's telling a joke, put your hand gently on his/her shoulder while laughing.   For girls, you can probably do this pretty much anytime for any reason. You're asking him a favor, you're talking about your weekend, etc. It seems hard at first, but the guy will definitely be happy. For guys, you can only really pull this off when being in a jokey mood, or if you're especially close with the girl. Or, after you hug, you can leave one arm around her for a little bit longer than normal and see how she reacts.  Rest your head on his or her shoulder and say "I'm tired," if it's late at night or if you see him/her early in the morning such as on the bus.   You can do this when you're pretending you're bored or exasperated, too. You're sitting next to one another during an announcement that's taking way too long, and you sigh as you move back gently and rest on the person.  Hug, touch him/her on the shoulder, or even kiss them on the cheek instead of just saying a simple goodbye.    Hug the person when you see them in the morning, or when you leave for the day; when you're congratulating them for an accomplishment; or when you don't think you'll see them for a while.  Kiss the person on the cheek if you're a girl and you want to send him a signal that he should be starting to kiss you. Kiss him on the cheek as you leave and he'll be thinking about it for days to come.  Kissing casually is harder for guys to do to girls because 1) most girls don't want their private space violated; and 2) most girls will expect a first kiss to be a little more than a peck on the cheek.  Mirror his or her pose when you are facing one another. This bit of body language sends a subtle signal; subliminally, they will feel as if they have a stronger connection to you just based on how you are mirroring them.   Don't do this all the time, however, or the other person might feel like you're aping them. Make sure when you do it, it's natural.  Tickling is a great way to flirt with someone physically. Tickling is OK among friends, but not so much among acquaintances, so make sure you know the person enough before you start tickling. Be careful to respect peoples boundaries and also not sneak into peoples houses and tickle them while they are sleeping. A couple tips when you are tickling:   It's more socially common for guys to tickle girls. That doesn't mean you can't tickle a guy if you're a girl, it just means that guys are usually the ones doing the tickling. Keep that in mind. Only tickle in safe areas. The last thing you want to do when flirting is make the other person feel uncomfortable. To ensure that you don't overstep his/her boundaries, try focusing on the arms, knees, and feet. Pay attention to your crush's body language, and what they say. If they're laughing and jokingly tell you to stop, it's probably OK to go on a little longer before you stop. If they don't laugh, however, seem uncomfortable, and ask you to stop, stop right away.  Touch the person when you compliment their ring, bracelet, new shirt or hair. Or say something like: "You have small hands," and put your hands against each others. See how long it takes before they pull their hand back. If it takes a while, s/he most likely enjoyed it.  If you are afraid of rejection, start slow with a subtle hand touch. Do it in a way he/she will notice, but that isn't too obvious at first. Then slowly move to holding hands if the person seems to like the contact.   For example, when walking next to each other, you could slightly touch his or her hand. If this person noticed it, s/he will look at you, and when s/he smiles you could try taking his/her hand. If they don't like it, you will know it's too soon to start holding hands. You can find an excuse for holding hands a lot of different ways. If you're in a haunted house, or on a rollercoaster, or showing them something, simply take their hand confidently and don't wait for them to react. If they don't like it or aren't ready for it yet, you will know. Interlocking hands is harder the first couple times than just clasping or "cupping" their hand. To avoid any awkwardness, stick with cupping in the beginning, where you put your pinky, ring, middle and index fingers together and grab onto the other person's palm.  Dancing is a great, social way to get close to that person you like and show them a bit of flirtatious fun. Whether it's at a school dance, your birthday party, or waiting at the bus stop (if you're silly and/or have a good sense of humor), dancing can help set the stage.   Go for the slow-dance. When that song comes on, go straight to your crush and ask them to dance. If you're a guy, put your arms around her waist. If you're a girl, put your arms around his shoulders. Get close enough so that your mouth is close to the other person's ears.  If you feel awkward, just gently touch their nose with the end of your finger while smiling. Then, slowly lean into the person as if you were going to hug him and start to kiss them with a little kiss.   If you can tell that the other person is a little unsure of him/herself, after you kiss them, give them a bit of encouragement. Tell them something like "That was nice, you're a good kisser." If they feel more confident, you're doing your job. First kisses can be awkward. That's just life. One thing, however, is certain: it takes time and a little bit of practice to get the hang of things. Don't worry about the awkwardness and focus on the things you like about the other person.  

touch them when making a point.  encourage body contact.  hang on the person.  rest on the person.  use more intimate contact.  mirror their body language.  tickle the other person.  find excuses to touch him/her.  touch and then hold their hand.  dance with the other person.  pull the awkwardness out of a kiss. 

 There are companies, such as Iron Mountain and Shred-it, whose job it is to dispose of sensitive materials. A pro of this method is that their services are certified. In a business environment, this is crucial for liability reasons. A con, however, is that the storage medium is no longer usable. They're also very expensive, so if money is an option, take it into your own hands. Get a hammer, beat the hard drive to pieces. Drill holes into it. Create a heroic, electromagnetic shock if you're feeling frisky. The creativity of this method is up to the destroyer's imagination. But heed this warning: There is no going back once the hammer falls.; , The DoD (Department of Defense) requires that any information be overwritten no less than 7 times to ensure its disposal. Good software to use for this method is Darik's Boot and Nuke (DBAN). The program is designed to securely erase a hard disk until data is permanently removed and no longer recoverable, which is achieved by overwriting the data with random numbers generated by Mersenne twister or ISAAC. The Gutmann method, Quick Erase, DoD Short (3 passes), and DoD 5220.22m (7 passes) are also included as options. A pro of this method is that DBAN is free, and of course the HDD is still usable. Major con: TIME. It can take quite awhile depending on contributing factors such as number of passes and HDD size.  Some drive duplicators such as The Ninja offer an option to erase data in retrospect to copying it. It does this sector to sector ensuring a thorough job. That's the major pro: it does it right. The con: Price. Well into the thousands of dollars.  

pay someone to shred or melt it.  destroy hard drives with derik's boot and nuke.  use a drive duplicator. 

   Make sure that the mating surfaces are free of debris and grit. Line up the joints so that they are straight and gently push them together with a twisting motion. Never force. If you start having trouble lining them up, gently take off the end that has the problem and clean the joint with a soft cloth, which you should be doing frequently anyway. Never use lipgloss or vaseline to ease the joints of the flute together. It will give you a quick fix, but later down the road will give you much more trouble than it's worth as dust/dirt and grime will build up much quicker when they have something to adhere to. If you will march with this flute, make sure that the joints are snug enough to prevent parts from flying off when the instrument is snapped up or down, and definitely think twice about joint lubrication. Marching is hard on instruments, so it makes sense to march with a spare instrument if you have one, especially if there is any chance of rain.; , The pitch will change somewhat with the temperature. If the flute cools off between playing passages, you can warm it up by closing the keys and softly blowing warm air straight into, not across, the hole. Feel free to play scales or some music to make it interesting. , Remove the moisture by gently sliding the cleaning rod through each of the sections in the same direction "without" using a twisting motion. By twisting the rod and cloth, and if pushing/pulling it back and forth inside your flute, the cloth and rod run the risk of snagging a pad or even getting stuck inside! If you use a cleaning swab or stick, do not store it in the body of the flute; the moisture in it will be absorbed in the pads. Also, never store the cleaning cloths inside the case of the flute, as the pads could, again, absorb the moisture.  Make sure to always handle the flute by the barrel when cleaning, as to not bend the keys and/or rods. Pay extra attention to the areas between the parts of the flute, as this is where the most gunk usually builds up, but be careful not to damage the keywork when trying to reach these areas. Don't worry if there's still some dust etc., when your flute is professionally cleaned, they will sort this. , They also sell small tools for doing this.  If sticky, they will make a little noise when they lift up. Slide pad paper or a piece of clean cigarette paper under a key, then close the key firmly. Never used the gummed edge of the cigarette paper. Do not use dollar bills--they are filthy! Do not pull the paper out while the key is pressed down, as this will create friction in the pad and bladder of the key. Instead, open the key and then slide the paper out. It will be just as effective and pulling the paper from under the keys, but not nearly as harmful to the pads. The stickiness is due to moisture, so make an effort to keep the flute dry. Use this technique gently and sparingly, since it could damage the thin membrane that makes the seal when you close a key.  The case is the safest place, but if you play frequently enough and have a safe corner, you might also consider getting a stand for any occasional breaks from practice.  If a key fails to lift when released, look to see if a spring (one of the tiny wires along the rod) has popped out of place. You may be able to push it back into place with the eraser end of a pencil or some similar, soft instrument. If you don't feel comfortable doing this, take it to a music shop or to an instrument repair shop.  If your flute is consistently out of tune, check the cork at the top of the head joint. Take the head joint off of the flute, insert your cleaning rod carefully into it upside down. The end of the rod should have a line towards the bottom of it which should appear directly or close enough to the centre of the embouchure hole. If the line is not in the center of the embouchure hole, then it means your cork is slightly out of alignment. Corks that are out of position will cause your flute to not properly play in tune. Do not attempt to solve this yourself by pushing in or pulling out on the cork, as you could cause damage.  Misaligned keys or deteriorating pads, especially, can mean leaks, which can affect your tone. If you find that you need to press down harder on the keys to get the notes to speak best, you probably have a leak and need some pads replaced at the repair shop.  There are some problems that develop over time and simply require professional care. 

learn to assemble your flute properly.  warm up the flute by playing or blowing warm air through it before tuning.  after each and every playing session, take your flute apart, so that the three pieces are separated.  ,  thread a soft cloth through the needle-like slot in the end of your tuning rod and flip the cloth over the cleaning rod, then wrap it around the rod so that there is none of the rod showing at the top, otherwise, you will scratch the inside of your precious flute.  carefully polish the flute with a different cloth - clean all the keys and the bodywork until it's free of fingerprints and other possible gunk.  carefully clean the lip plate with the cloth, as this is the most fragile part of the flute.  ,  you can use a q-tip dipped in rubbing alcohol to remove dust and buildup between the keys in those hard to reach spots, but it's not recommended to do this too often.  clean your pads if they are sticky from water build up.  store and carry your flute in its case, avoiding moisture and temperature extremes.  keep your springs in their places and do not mess around with the mechanisms and screws unless you know what you are doing.  check your tuning cork periodically.  pay attention to your pads.  have your flute serviced periodically by somebody who specializes in flutes, or woodwind, at the least.  remember: take care of your flute, and it will take care of you.  

 Use 6 ounces/180 milliliters (6.1  fl oz) if you are certain of the freshness of the starter. When in doubt, use a full cup of buttermilk as starter.; ,, Shake thoroughly to mix. Label the jar with the date.  This should take about 24 hours. If you find it takes longer than 36 hours, the starter was no longer active (meaning that the bacteria has died). The buttermilk may or may not be tasty if it takes longer than 36 hours but it can still be used for baking.  This happens because the bacteria have fermented the milk, and the lactic acid is causing the milk proteins to thicken. Refrigerate immediately.  

add a bacterial starter of 6 to 8 ounces/180-235ml of active fresh cultured buttermilk to a clean quart jar.  fill the rest of the jar with fresh milk.  ,  screw the lid on on securely.  let the jar sit out in a warm part of the room until thickened.  check to make sure the thickened buttermilk coats the glass. 

 You’ll need to remove any remaining trace of past finish before using a sealant. Use sandpaper before you apply any sealants. This removes finish products that may keep the sealant from absorbing. The sealant method is best for any previously finished wood, since oil-based stain may not sink into the wood.   Use a rougher sandpaper for any areas that need more attention. Then finish sanding the surface with a finer sandpaper to ensure an even surface., You can find these products at a home improvement stores. Water Seal and Stain Sealer are common names for wood sealants. You can also purchase a tinted sealant and sand the surface of the wood before you apply it.   Sealants are often labeled by the type of product to which they should be applied to. For example, you may find deck sealant, fence sealant, outdoor sealant, floor sealant or furniture sealant. Buy a marine wood sealant if your wood needs to stand up to humidity, UV rays and water. Check the product to get specific application rules and dry times. Some products can be used with a paint sprayer. Purchase a paint sprayer or paint brushes for application., Prepare your paintbrush or sprayer and focus on creating an even coat of the surface. Make sure the temperature and humidity of the air is in the right range of the product, or the product can evaporate too quickly. Consider working in an area with a controlled humidity like a garage.   Make sure the wood’s surface is cleaned before applying the sealant.  Consult the product’s package directions for proper drying times. The drying times will be much shorter than oil’s drying times. Many sealants take between 4-10 hours.  Use sandpaper with fine-grit to improve adhesion of the second coat, but only if it is recommended by the product instructions. Do this once the product has completely finished drying.   You can also use “0000” (very fine) steel wool to clean off the sealant.  Softwoods may need two to three coats, while some hardwoods will only need one. Softwoods are cheaper woods that haven’t been treated in the past. Popular softwoods are cedar, pine, redwood spruce, balsa, and yew. Hardwood is denser wood that is used for higher quality furniture and decks. Popular hardwood is beech, hickory, mahogany, maple, oak, and walnut., Let the wood cure for several days before using it or placing furniture over it. When water is applied to the wood's surface, it darkens the wood instead of beading up and flowing off the surface.   Apply the sealant every few years for healthy wood care.  

prepare the surface.  purchase a water-based wood sealer.  apply an even coat.  allow the product to dry.  clean the first coat.  apply a second and third coat.  give the wood time to cure. 

 It used to be that doctors told women to wait at least six weeks after delivery to start exercising again. This has changed, though. So long as you’ve had an uncomplicated delivery, it’s usually safe to start working out once you feel ready. Just talk to your doctor first to make sure.  There’s every reason to start exercising again after your delivery. Working out can improve your cardiovascular fitness, help you lose baby weight, restore your muscle tone, boost your mood, and improve your energy levels. You will probably have to wait a while longer to exercise if you had a C-section or complicated vaginal delivery, however. Make sure to talk to your doctor to ensure you’re sufficiently healed before starting.; , One great possibility is a baby-carrier. A baby-carrier will let you get out of the house as well as get in a good workout with your baby practically in your arms. Using a walking or jogging stroller, backpack, or front-pack are all options. They also offer an added benefit for exercise — your baby will act as extra weight, forcing you to work harder.Try a jogging stroller. These have big tires and should be easy to push, whether you’re running, jogging, or just walking. They’re best for babies that are at least six months old and they can go off paved sidewalks and onto trails. A front-pack is another great option. Just strap it on and snuggle close while walking — but don’t run or jog. You should also keep your baby facing you early on until her neck muscles are more developed. Just talk to your doctor before using one, if you’d had a C-section or other complication during your delivery. Backpacks work the same as front-packs, of course, just on your back. You can adjust the straps to keep you and your baby comfortable while walking or going about your daily activities. With both backpacks and front-packs, you’ll also have to carry the baby’s extra weight and will burn more calories. Your baby will be ready to use a backpack when she can sit up unsupported, at about six to eight months.  To start, just put your baby in a front carrier that supports their head or hold them in front of you.Put on some music that you like and then start to gently dance, keeping your abdominal muscles taut. You can also switch between slow and moderately fast music to get your heart rate elevated. Just remember to move gently and to avoid bouncing and sharp turns, especially if your baby is in a carrier. If you’d like, you might also put your baby in a bouncy seat or swing and dance around her. Keep interacting by maintaining eye contact and making animated movements.  Putting a baby on their tummy while awake and supervised helps to develop stronger head, neck, and shoulder muscles and to practice skills that will eventually help them turn over. It can also prevent a flattening of the back of the head, or “positional plagiocephaly.”Set your baby down on their tummy across your lap two or three times per day for several minutes. As they get stronger, you can start to use a floor mat for longer periods of time. The idea is to encourage them to look around and hold up their head and upper body. Some research suggests that babies with more tummy-time may learn to turn over, sit up without support, and crawl earlier.Tummy-time will also ensure that the back of your baby’s head gets a rest. Babies’ skulls are formed of soft plates and, if too much time is spent on the back, these plates can become flattened. Always make sure that tummy-time is supervised. It’s generally OK for your baby to be on their tummy while awake and attended, but doctors recommend that babies sleep on their backs to lower the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Put your baby to sleep on their back if they get sleepy or fussy during tummy-time.  One of the hardest parts about exercising with a small child is finding the time. Chances are that you’ll be emotionally and physically tired, and sometimes you may feel too worn down for a full workout. That’s OK, but do the best you can. Find ways to push yourself to be active and pencil exercise into your schedule.If you have a spouse or partner, negotiate times for your exercise. Ask your partner to take over baby duties so that you can get in a 30-minute walk or jog several times per week. Consider feeding your baby before workouts. Some research suggests that intense physical exercise causes lactic acid to build up in breast milk. While this won’t harm your baby, it may give the milk a sour and unpleasant taste. One way you can avoid this is by sticking to moderate exercise and ingesting plenty of fluids, or by feeding your baby before the workout. Alternatively, you can pump breast milk before your workout and feed the baby afterward. This may also help you stay comfortable while working out.  If you want more company, you can also consider finding an exercise group or class. Check out the gyms and community centers in your area to see whether there are baby-friendly exercise classes. More and more, gyms recognize that parents with small children have trouble getting out and staying fit and offer special classes. These allow you to bring along a small child and to work out without having to find child care.Try searching on the internet for classes near you. You can also try calling local health clubs, gyms, and community centers to see what’s available. Don’t just limit yourself to aerobics. You may also be able to find baby-friendly yoga, dance, or even martial arts classes. You can find classes like this in many cities for babies as young as six weeks old all the way up to one year.  Another option is to try the pool. Many pools around the US offer infant and toddler aquatic classes, which allow parents to swim and enjoy time in the pool with small children. Such programs have even been developed by the American Red Cross and YMCA.Call pools in your neighborhood to inquire about aquatic lessons for moms and infants. Some places offer such classes all year round. Keep in mind that these aren’t “swimming lessons,” though. Children really aren’t ready for proper swimming lessons until about age four and your infant will need your constant and close supervision. You should always be within an arm’s length of your child.  Don’t forget to comb your own networks of friends, acquaintances, neighbors, and co-workers. Ask other people you know who have small children. See what your peers are doing and whether they know of or participate in informal groups of moms and dads who get together for exercise.   Informal groups might get together two or three times a week for stroller walks in the park or around the neighborhood, for example. You might also be able to find informal groups of moms who do yoga together with their babies. Your baby can relax on your mat while you stretch and socialize.  Exercising with your baby doesn’t have to start after delivery. Working out is also good for you while you’re still pregnant. Gentle stretching will keep your muscles limber and warm and reduce feelings of stiffness. It can also help to relieve aches and pains, including in the back, and reduce leg cramps. There are a number of simple stretches that you can do on your own to benefit. Make sure your muscles are already warmed up before you begin stretching to avoid injury. Try a light warm up like walking.Stretch your neck by relaxing your shoulders and neck muscles. Then, drop your head forward and slowly rotate it to your right shoulder, back to the middle, and to the left shoulder. Do three or four complete rotations in each direction. To work your thighs, stand with one foot about two feet in front of the other and with your toes pointed in the same direction. Then lean forward, supporting your weight on the forward thigh. Switch sides and repeat for a total of ten. To stretch your shoulders, bring them forward before rotating them up toward your ears and then back downward. Repeat this several times.  Toning exercises include the benefits of stretches while also strengthening your core muscles, including the abdomen, pelvic floor, vaginal muscles, back, and thighs. Apart from the usual pluses of exercise, these activities will help to prepare you physically for delivery. Just remember to avoid positions that make you feel unstable or could increase the risk of falling.Try pelvic tilts. Start on the ground on all fours, keeping your hands in line with your shoulders and knees with your hips. Your back should be straight. Then, inhale and tighten your abdomen, tuck your buttocks under, and tilt your pelvis forward all in one motion. Exhale, relax, and repeat 10 times. You can do a pelvic tilt while standing, as well. Just stand with your feet about 10 inches apart with your legs relaxed and bent slightly at the knee. Then, put your hands on your hips and inhale. Tighten your abdomen, tuck your buttocks under, and shift your pelvis forward. Exhale, relax, and repeat. You can also do Kegel exercises. Just imagine that you are trying to stop yourself from passing gas or stopping the flow of urine. Try not to move other muscles or shift while doing Kegel exercises – in fact, no one should be able to tell that you’re doing them.  It’s generally safe for pregnant women to exercise in low- or moderate-intensity aerobic exercise several times per week. In fact, most should aim for at least thirty minutes on most, if not all, days of the week. Slowly work your way up if you haven’t been exercising regularly, and expect to do lower-intensity workouts than you did before the pregnancy.If you weren’t exercising previously, start with as little as five minutes of activity per day. Then, work up to ten minutes, fifteen minutes, and eventually thirty. If you exercised before, it’s probably OK to continue at the same level while pregnant. Just make sure that you’re comfortable and have the go-ahead from your doctor. Try a low-intensity activity like walking. It’s a great aerobic exercise and will be easy on your joints. You can also try things like swimming and cycling on a stationary bicycle. You can also take a class. Consider signing up for prenatal yoga or low-impact aerobics for pregnant women, for example, which are offered at some hospitals and fitness centers. That way, you’ll be ready to continue exercising with your baby in the months after your delivery.  

start once you feel ready.  get a baby-carrier and get moving.  try “baby dancing.” baby dancing is a light cardio workout that you can do pretty much anywhere, either at home, in the yard, or elsewhere, and will also help to improve your coordination and balance.  do “tummy-time.” “tummy-time” is exercise for your baby but a great chance for you both to bond and interact.  schedule time for exercise.  join a baby-friendly exercise class.  enroll in an aquatic class.  look for local groups of moms/dads.  limber up with stretches.  try toning exercises.  get moving with aerobic exercise.

 A good way to prevent texting and driving is to turn your phone off. This helps you not hear any text or social media notifications, or see the screen light up when you get a text. If you don’t see any new messages, you won’t be tempted to look at them or respond.As soon as you stop, you can turn the phone back on. If you are on a long car ride, you can pull off the road every hour or so to check your messages if you need to check them.; , If you don’t want to turn your phone off completely, turn it to silent. Even on silent you can see when you have a message. Just make sure you put the phone face down so you can’t see it light up with a new message and be tempted.If you want to leave your phone ringer on, you can silence your text message notifications.  If you want to keep your phone on, you can try to place it in a spot where you cannot reach it while driving. This helps keep your phone unavailable so you cannot be tempted to sneak a peak. Try placing it in the trunk, glove box, behind your seat, or in your console.If you do this, make sure you will not want to reach to these inconvenient places while driving. Trying to grab something out of reach can cause an accident.  To avoid a situation where you realize you need to send a very important text, take a moment before you start the car to send any texts you need to. If you will not be able to wait to read the reply, send the text after your trip.You should also plug your destination in your GPS and pull up any playlists you want to listen to before you start the car. This is also very distracting while you drive.  If you are in the car with someone, ask them to read you any texts you receive. You can also ask them to respond to the texts. This allows you to respond while driving without texting yourself.You should only let the person on your phone if you trust them and don’t mind them reading your text conversation.  

turn your phone off.  put your phone on silent.  place the phone in a location you cannot reach.  send texts before you drive.  get someone to text for you.

 In order to cross most state lines with your dog, you must have what is called a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (CVI). This certificate ensures that your dog doesn’t have any diseases that can be spread to other animals.There are a few states that don’t require a CVI for dogs: California, Georgia (unless the dog is for sale), Main (unless being transferred to a new owner), Montana (unless transferring ownership), Texas (unless the dog arrives by air), Washington State (unless the pet is being commercially imported). A CVI states that a veterinarian has not observed any symptoms of contagious disease. It only lasts for 30 days., There are 21 states with some form of law against leaving pets in cars. One state (Pennsylvania) has a bill waiting to pass. A “hot car” law generally disallows pets to be left unattended inside vehicles in a way that appears to endanger their lives.These states are: Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin., In some states, police and humane officers are allowed to break into a car if they see an unattended pet. In others, both police and civilians are allowed to break in. In still others, there are variations on this law, such as permitting someone to break into a car only after the authorities have been alerted.Only police and humane officers are allowed to break into cars in Arizona, California, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, and Washington. Anyone is allowed to break into cars for a pet in Tennessee and Wisconsin.  If you leave your dog in a car and you are caught in the act, you risk conviction by a judge. You may be issued a misdemeanor, a fine, or an infraction. In New Hampshire, you can even be convicted of a felony if you repeat the offense.

 You might be used to saying "I want to find the woman of my dreams" but you need to know what this means for you, such as what her personality is, what she likes/dislikes or even looks like.   Think of key personality traits you consider important in a lifelong partner. Loyalty, generosity, fun-loving, outgoing, focused, and so forth. Which of your own personality traits do you want matched? Think of the values you'd like this person to hold. Do you want her to have similar values to your own? Or, are you okay with her having quite different ones from you? Consider your faith or lack of it. Does your ideal woman need to be of the same faith? Also consider family values––what are yours and in what way must hers match those? What interests would you like this person to have? Does she have to have the same interests as you? Or would you prefer she had completely different interests, or a mixture of both? Is it enough that she's willing to learn about your interests? Be frank with yourself about appearance. How important a factor is this? Might it be holding you back from finding someone with an amazing personality? Be a devil's advocate. What sort of things do you not want in your ideal partner? What would you be willing and not willing to compromise about?; , It is very hard for a person to measure up to an ideal or a creation of perfection in the mind. Having a dream notion of another human being can cause you to be blind to their faults initially, only to leave you extremely disappointed later when these become apparent because the dream is shattered. A realistic approach is to accept that no person is perfect and that it's important to recognize and understand the flawed sides of a person as much as seeing all the things you wish to see.   Realize that any person you date is a mixture of amazing traits and flaws. You are no different either. You'll never find a woman to date if you expect her to be 100 percent perfect. No such person exists. Learn to overlook imperfections that don't have a major impact on the relationship. If there are things that will have a major impact, don't be blind to them and realize early on that they could be deal breakers. Looking for perfection may mean that you are too picky and won't ever find the woman who meets your expectations. Realize that it takes time to get to know the real person underneath. If you have shallow ideals, you may never really get to know the amazing qualities of the woman unless you're prepared to take the time to get to know her.  Are you likely to be the ideal man of her dreams? Do you take good care of your health and appearance? Are you interesting? To attract a person, be attractive yourself. Most importantly, you need to understand yourself well, knowing your own identity and values. If you don't know these things, you will have a hard time defining boundaries in your relationship and you may fail to connect well, be afraid of commitment or not notice when you over-rely on the other person to define you.   What are your values and beliefs? Do you have these sorted out for yourself? Do you know what your life's goals are and what matters to you? Are you aware of your flaws? What are you doing to address them or manage around them? Do you have an issue with perfection? If you consider yourself to be perfect, another person will find it hard to meet that, ever. Be willing to compromise and to see your flaws. Are you truly ready for a long-term relationship yet? You need to know this in order to be serious about your pursuit.  Where do you find the woman of your dreams? This will depend on the kind of person you're looking for and your own interests. You'll be best off staying open to meeting a woman of your dreams anywhere you might be, so be aware at all times. That said, some of the things you can do to help you find this special person include looking where the possibilities are increased. Some examples include:   Look among your friends. Do they know of people who might be compatible with you? Ask them to keep an eye for someone with whom you might click. Visit places where you like doing things. If you're sporty and you're looking for a woman who is also sporty, spend time doing that sport and keeping your eyes open. Join a club, take up a sport or become involved in triathlons, etc. if you're not already so involved. Use online dating resources. There are many options here and you'll easily find matches to your criteria. Go to social events. Mingle at parties, drinks events, dinner parties and even family events such as weddings and birthdays. You never know who you may bump into and the fun feeling of such occasions can help show people in their happiest light. Join a hobby or activity class, club or event. For example, if you like dancing, join a dancing class or club. Your daily commute. Maybe she sits next to you on the train or bus? Strike up a pleasant conversation if you keep seeing the same woman and feel you have a connection.  You could be walking down the street, doing your grocery shopping or waiting in a queue to pay a bill when you suddenly get a notion that you've found the one. No matter how much you plan and act, sometimes when finding love it's that lucky moment of crossing paths and realizing instantaneously that this is someone you'd like to get to know better.  You won't win any hearts by being gruff, rude or unpleasant to her or to her friends. Show her respect and treat her friends kindly. They will play a role in judging you and telling her what they think, so be sure it's going to be mostly good things they have to say.  Don't make an instant judgment as to whether or not this person is the woman of your dreams. It will take time to learn more about her, to get to know her personality and preferences, to find out just how compatible the two of you are. This means being realistic about setting aside the time to do this and not rushing the relationship or your judgment.   Make regular time for each other. Do fun things together to ensure that you enjoy one another's company. Talk about values, beliefs and things you both care about. These are important aspects for both of you.  If it's all about you, she'll begin to feel that she's an appendage and not being treated as an individual. Take care not to fill the conversation space with everything you care about rather than allowing her plenty of space to share her thoughts too.   Find out all that you can about what she likes and dislikes. In turn, share your own likes and dislikes too. This can be an area of deal-breaking, so be aware of this at all times. If you start talking about things that bore her to tears or bother her, tuck this information away for later reflection. Is this a problem for you or is it something you can live with?  , How the two of you cope with not agreeing with one another, having an argument or not seeing eye-to-eye will determine future conflict resolution. This is a valuable part of getting to know one another when determining if this is your dream woman.   Does she handle conflict well? Does she argue fairly to stand by her point without dismissing you? Do you feel that you can work things out amicably when you don't agree with one another? Can you see yourself spending a lifetime with this person, able to resolve disagreements in an acceptable way?  , Be real yourself and be genuine in how you interact with this woman. You can't expect to build strong foundations for a lifetime with the woman of your dreams if everything you've represented to her has been a fantasy. It'll all come tumbling down in the most painful way if you try to be something you're not. Instead, be real and let her get to know the person you really are. That way, you'll be absolutely certain that she's the woman of your dreams, because she connects with your true self.  

define the woman of your dreams.  be aware that whenever you focus on someone being "a dream", you are manufacturing something that may not exist.  consider your own contribution to this future relationship.  begin looking.  remember that luck plays a part in finding this person.  be polite to the woman and to her friends.  be prepared to get to know one another well.  focus on getting to know her most.  deal constructively with disagreement.  keep things real. 

 It should be less than an inch thick and have green bark. 8 inches (20.3 cm) is a good length. The ideal twig is straight, smooth, and round so it makes a perfectly shaped whistle.   If you can't find a willow twig that is 8 inches (20.3 cm) long, you can try to find a longer one and cut off 8 inches (20.3 cm) of it to make a whistle from. You can also cut off side branches if needed, although you may need a bigger knife.; ,, Take care to cut only the outer layer of bark and not completely through the wood.  Wet the twig (all the way from the ring to the mouthpiece) with water and tap it gently with the handle of your knife so it loosens the bark. Then carefully twist and pull the bark off. Try not to rip or break the bark because you will need to put it back on the twig later. Dunk it in water to keep it wet and moist until you need it again.  The length and depth of this notch is what changes the pitch of your whistle. , Dipping the bark-less end of your willow into a glass of water first will help. Blow on the end with the notch!  , 

find a willow twig that has no side branches.  carve a small notch into the twig, about a quarter of the length in.  ,  cut a ring around the twig about two inches further in than the notch.  remove the bark.  make the notch deeper and cut it some more so that it extends down the length of the twig, pointing towards the end that still has bark on it.  carve off a sliver of wood from the upper surface of the twig to make it flat.  ,  slip the bark back on.  finished.

 Investing can be very complex, but fortunately, it does not have to be. In fact, by sticking to some very basic principles, you can invest your savings and see them grow over a long time period.   Generally speaking, there are a few types of options for investing. The main ones are stocks, and bonds. Stocks represent ownership in a business, and bonds represent money you lend to a business or government in exchange for regular interest payments. Most investors have a combination of debt and equity in their portfolios.  Mutual funds and ETFs are similar in that each is a collection of many stocks or bonds. They provide a way to diversify your portfolio to an extent that would be impossible if you were only investing in stocks one at a time. There are some significant differences between Mutual funds and ETFs, so research both before deciding where to invest your money.   ETFs offer greater flexibility and lower expense ratios compared to mutual funds.ETFs are more tax efficient, but they see fewer capital gains than mutual funds.ETFs trade like regular stocks and their value fluctuates throughout the day. The value of a mutual fund is calculated only once a day, using the closing market prices of the securities in the fund's portfolio.Mutual funds are managed while most ETFs are not. The holdings of a mutual fund are selected by a fund manager who seeks to make the fund as profitable as possible. The manager actively monitors the market and revises the fund's assets accordingly.  Decide if you want to use an online broker or a full service broker. A full service broker has the time and knowledge to make your investment work for you; however, they can also charge a substantial fee. If you feel you understand the market fairly well and want to manage your own portfolio, then you may wish to sign up with an online broker, such as TD Ameritrade, Capital One, Scottrade, E*Trade and Charles Schwab.   Always be mindful of fees before opening accounts, as well as account minimums. Brokers all charge fees per trade (ranging from $4.95 to $10 generally), and many also require a minimum initial investment (ranging from $500 to much higher). Currently, online brokers that have no minimum initial investment include Capital One Investing, TD Ameritrade, First Trade, TradeKing, and OptionsHouse.If you want more help with your investing, there are a variety of ways to find financial advice: if you want someone who helps you in a non-sales environment, you can find an advisor in your area at one of the following sites: letsmakeaplan.org, www.napfa.org, garrettplanningnetwork.com. You can also go to your local bank or financial institution; however, many of these charge higher fees and require a large minimum to invest ($500,000 to $1,000,000 is common). Some advisors, (like a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™) have the ability to give advice in a number of areas, like investments, taxes and retirement planning, while others can only take direction but not give advice, Also important to know is that not all people who work at financial institutions are bound to a fiduciary duty of putting their client's interest first. Before starting to work with someone, ask about their training and expertise, to make sure they are the right fit for you.  Instead of investing a large amount of money and hoping the timing works out, you can invest over time, lessening the risk of investing. This is known as dollar cost averaging (DCA).To do this, make a schedule (like once a month) to spend a fixed amount buying shares. When the price of the shares is low, you will purchase more shares; when the price is high, you will purchase fewer shares, all for the same amount of money each month.Let's say you commit to investing $100 in company X once a month. This month, the shares cost $10 each, so you will buy ten shares (for $100). Next month, the shares cost $20, so you buy five shares (for $100), an so on. Always stay invested regardless of what happens to the market. There have been 11 market crashes since 1956, but every time the market has recovered to earn far more than it lost. Simply continue adding each and every month, and be comfortable with the fact that your wealth will grow over time.  The real secret to wealth is to start investing early. Doing this will allow your wealth to "compound" over time. Compounding means that your initial amount will earn interest, then the next year, interest will be earned on your original amount plus the added interest.For example, if you invest $100 and it earns 5% in a year, you would have $105. The next year, you would earn 5% on $105. This means you would would have $110.25. The next year, you would earn 5% on 110.25, and so on. The results over time are incredible. If you invested $1,000 a month starting 30 years ago, you would have $1.8 million today. This is the surest way to create wealth. Learn more here.  

understand the basics of investing.  learn about mutual funds and exchange traded funds (etfs).  choose a broker.  add to your investments regularly.  start investing as soon as possible. 

 Investments work best when they are allowed to grow over the long term. Withdrawing cash early from an annuity brings with it a risk of fees and will significantly harm the long-term potential of your investment. Consider very carefully whether you are in a true financial emergency before taking steps to sell an annuity, and be sure to use early withdrawal options only as a last resort.; , Because of the potential penalties of getting cash from an annuity, consider other options for getting cash during a financial emergency.Many of these options come with lower risks and few to no financial penalties. These include:    Take out a short-term, unsecured loan (a loan without collateral) from your bank or a local credit union.  Renting out a room via AirBNB or another website.  Sell unwanted items online. Take on an additional part-time job or side gig, such as babysitting, dogsitting, or working retail.  Get a Home Equity Loan. These loans will require interest payments, but they might be lower than the penalties you would pay for cashing in an annuity.  In some cases, you might be able to receive small, immediate cash payouts from your annuity without too many penalties and fees. However, if you need to cash in your entire annuity, you will likely pay some hefty fines. Therefore, it is important that you know exactly how much cash you need to get through your financial emergency. By only taking out the money you absolutely need, you might be able to be more financially stable in the long run.  An immediate annuity will provide monthly, quarterly, or annual cash payments to the investor immediately after the investment is purchased. A deferred annuity, however, allows the investment to grow for a period of some years before the payouts begin.If you have an immediate annuity already, you can simply collect your cash installments at the appropriate intervals. Depending on how much cash you require, these installments might be sufficient for your needs. When payments are made, annuities are taxed on the earning portion of the asset, not a return of principal. Additionally, an immediate annuity within a retirement account, like a Roth IRA, can provide penalty-free payments to persons under 59.5 years of age., This option is one that many investors consider as they transition into retirement. They use the deferred annuity to grow their money over the long-term and then convert into an immediate annuity to guarantee an income stream during their retirement.If you convert your deferred annuity to an immediate annuity, you might have the best of both worlds: immediate access to some cash while still allowing your investment portfolio to grow.Depending on when you purchased your deferred annuity, however, it might be costly for you to pursue the conversion option. Make sure you discuss fees and penalties carefully with your insurance company and your financial advisor before undertaking a conversion., If you have an immediate annuity, you will receive several small payments each year. This option is a good one for those who are in immediate need of cash (such as those who are on a fixed income). And as long as you only collect the amount specified in your contract, you can do so without paying extra fees.   You will still likely have to pay income tax on a portion or all of the amount you collect.While immediate annuities provide an immediate cash flow, they generally pay out less total money than deferred annuities, which have more of an opportunity to grow., A surrender period is the period of time after the initial purchase of the annuity where you will be charged hefty fees for cashing out your plan. A surrender period can be anywhere from 5-10 years after purchase, depending on your contract, though it is usually between 6-8 years.If your surrender period has passed, you might be able to cash out your annuity without paying too many fees. If your surrender period has not yet passed, you might want to consider the expenses involved before continuing the early withdrawal process.  Unlike deferred annuities, most immediate annuities do not provide an option for small-sum early withdrawals or partial sales. You will likely have the opportunity, however, to sell the entire immediate annuity for a lump-sum.Again, reserve this option as a last resort given the hassle and fees involved in cashing out your immediate annuity early.  Withdrawing cash from your annuity early can lead to hefty penalties, taxes, and fines. Be sure that you take these penalties into account before making your decision to withdraw your cash.If your annuity is part of a retirement account and you withdraw your money before you are 59.5 years old, you will have to pay a 10% early withdrawal fee to the federal government.If you withdraw your money within the first 5-8 years of purchase, you will likely have to pay a "surrender fee" to your insurance company. The exact fee amount depends on your contract. Many surrender fees begin at about a 7% penalty for the first year after purchase and decrease over time from there. However, some companies might charge a fee as high as 20%.Cash you receive from annuities counts as income. You will likely have to pay income taxes in addition to the early withdrawal fees and surrender fees. The one exception is that payments from an annuity as part of a Roth IRA are not taxable.  None will give you the full value of your future payments. They might offer anywhere from 60% to 85% of the value of your annuity. Getting 85% of your annuity’s value would be considered a fairly good offer. Since you are legally transferring your rights, you want a company that follows standard procedures and will prepare you for any required court proceedings.   Understand that you are not getting a good deal here because the company you are selling to has to make a profit. Annuity sale prices are reached by discounting a series of future cash flows by some interest rate. Typically, a buyer will use a lower rate than is earned in the annuity to make a profit themselves. This results in a lower sale price for you.  Before agreeing to sell your annuity to a third party, consult a trusted legal or financial expert. They will help you determine your financial liability and help you navigate through the complicated contracts you might have to sign. This will help to ensure that you understand what is happening and that it is done correctly. They might also be able to help guide you to the most reputable companies that purchase annuities.  Documents required for the sale of an annuity include two forms of identification, your initial annuity policy, and an application to sell your annuity to a third party. You might have to contact your insurance company in order to receive correct, up-to-date copies of your paperwork., Upon submitting your paperwork and paying your fees and penalties, you will be able to receive your cash payout. Make sure that you report this income correctly during tax time and that you pay all the extra taxes on this money to avoid future penalties.   You might want to consider discussing your finances with a financial advisor to ensure that you will use and invest the cash payout properly.  

consider carefully whether you need immediate cash.  think about other options for immediate cash.  determine exactly how much money you need.  determine whether you have an immediate or deferred annuity.  convert a deferred annuity to an immediate annuity.  collect your cash payments without penalty.  determine your surrender period.  decide to sell your immediate annuity.  be aware of possible financial penalties.  research companies that offer cash in exchange for annuity payments.  consult your tax attorney or financial advisor.  collect your documents.  complete the transaction.

 The state of Nevada does not require couples to be residents of Nevada to marry in the state. But, marriage licenses issued in Nevada must be used within the state of Nevada. Certain restrictions do apply, such as:Age: If you are 16 or 17 years old, you must have one parent or legal guardian present. A notarized written permission slip is also accepted. But it must be written in English and must state the name, birth date, age of the minor child, as well as the relationship of the person giving consent. If you are under 16, marriage can only be authorized by court order when the request has been filed by either a parent or legal guardian. Family relationship: Nevada does not grant marriage licenses to ancestors and their descendants, such as parents and children, grandparents and grandchildren, siblings, or aunts/uncles and their nieces/nephews. Second cousins or first cousins may marry in the state of Nevada. Relationship status: If you were previously married, your divorce must be final. You will need to provide the date (month, year) of your divorce and the location (city, state) where you were divorced. Nevada does not do proxy marriages so both people must be present. However, Nevada’s county clerk office is prohibited from issuing a new Marriage License to couples currently married, so you do not need a new marriage license to renew your vows with your partner. Same-sex marriage: As of 2014, same-sex couples can legally marry in Nevada. The state of Nevada also recognizes same-sex marriages from other states and countries. You may apply for a marriage license even if you already have a domestic partnership or civil union. The application procedures are the same as for heterosexual couples.; , Each person must have at least one of the following documents when applying for a marriage license. You will also need to provide your Social Security Number.Valid picture ID, such as a valid driver’s license or a valid identification card from the DMV. A valid passport. A Resident Alien card. A military ID. A certified or original birth certificate. If you have a foreign birth certificate, it must be translated into English and notarized. If you are a refugee and do not have a birth certificate, you must get a signed and sealed record of your name, birth date, birthplace, and parents’ names from your sponsoring agency. If the document is in a foreign language, you must provide a certified translation into English along with the original. A certified translation will be signed, dated, and contain a statement that attests the accuracy of the translation.  If either you or your partner were previously married, you must provide information about those marriages on the application. You must state whether the former spouse is living and whether the marriage ended in divorce, annulment, or death.If you are divorced, you must be able to give your previous spouse’s full legal name, the date the divorce was finalized, and the city, state, and country that issued the divorce. You may also be required to show a certified copy of the divorce decree or other dissolution document.  If you want to change your legal surname after marriage, the easiest way to do this is to indicate it on your application for the marriage license. Once your marriage is completed, the name on the license application becomes your legal surname.Keep in mind getting a marriage license with your new name does not mean your name is automatically changed. You and your partner must choose your legal surnames.

Military personnel may have up to 180 days to get married.  Once you get your marriage license, you must wait a minimum of 24 hours before you can have a marriage ceremony. So, if you were issued your license at 10:48 AM, you could not marry until 10:48 AM the following day.

 In order to find placement at a sober living home, you need to be in active recovery from an alcohol or substance abuse disorder. If you are not currently sober, you need to first seek treatment at drug or alcohol treatment rehabilitation center and successfully complete the program. Sober living homes are not treatment centers, they are maintenance facilities that help you transition into living independently in sobriety.Understand that sober living homes will not hold you as accountable as your treatment facility did. If you are newly sober and are struggling to stay that way, you may need more support structure than a sober living home can provide. For the best chance of success, you may want to have some recovery experience and some successful strategies you can use to help you stay sober.; , Different homes are structured in different ways. The type of home you need may depend on what you can afford, the type of structure you need, and your need for privacy. Sober living homes may be in single-family residential homes, which may feel more communal, or in an apartment building, where clients get more privacy and independence.   Some homes may offer group or individual therapy opportunities. Homes may insist on attendance at a 12-step program meeting as long as you are living there. Others may not have a meeting requirement.Determine what kind of structure would benefit you. Remember, the fewer days of sobriety you’ve had, the more support you will likely need. Consider finding a home with residents of your same sex. Co-ed housing makes it more likely that romantic relationships will develop and residents will lose sight of their sobriety goals., Figure out what you can afford to pay in rent and other fees. While length of residence varies, the average stay at a sober living home is between five and eight months.Residents in many sober living homes are allowed to stay in the home as long as they need to, so long as they remain sober and follow house rules. Residents can decide to leave when they are ready for more independence.Make sure you plan for at least three months. Longer stays mean less likelihood of relapse., If you already have a job, find a place that is convenient to your work. If you are currently unemployed, you may wish to consider a home near lots of job opportunities. Consider how you will get to and from work and other commitments -- is the home accessible via public transportation, or will you need to have a car?   Think about what kind of environment you’d like to live in, and what environment would help you better maintain your sobriety. Would you prefer the activity of a city or the calm of a suburban or rural environment?  , If you are finishing up treatment at a rehab facility, ask your case manager if they recommend a few sober living homes. See if your case manager can help arrange a tour for you.   Be aware that the quality of sober living homes varies and their regulation is spotty. Many states do not require that they be licensed, as they are considered cooperative living arrangements.Look online for homes other than the ones recommended by the treatment center. Treatment centers and insurance companies may receive undisclosed referral fees from some transitional living facilities, so make sure you broaden your search beyond places recommended by your facility.You can also ask for recommendations from a community health department or mental health agency. Narrow down your list to a few top choices to tour. You may want to base your decisions on location, type of living arrangement, cost, or other factors important to you. Try touring at least three homes to see variations of sober living communities.  Attend a 12-step meeting near the homes you are looking at and ask participants what they know about those places. Find out if the place has a reputation -- good or bad -- from people who have the most knowledge about struggling with sobriety.   You could ask questions about safety at the home, ethics of staff and residents, what the neighborhood around the house is like, or any other concern you might have. You could say, “I’m going to tour this house next week. Do you know anything about it? Is it known to be a good program and place to live?” If a sober living home has a bad reputation in the 12-step community, it is best that you look at other sober living homes.  Call the sober living home and ask for a tour and a meeting. Bring a list of questions you want to ask. Meet with staff and get copies of all necessary paperwork for your reference.   You could call and say, “I’m recently out of a treatment facility for an alcohol addiction, and I was hoping to schedule an appointment to see your facility. Is there a time this week I could come by?” Make sure the sober living home currently has beds available. If not, you could ask, “Do you have any idea of when a bed may open up? Is there a waiting list I could get on if I am interested?”  , Talk to some of the residents about their experience in the sober living home. Find out where they work, where they go to meetings, and things they like and don’t like about living in the home.   Understand that if there is an employee of the sober living home around the residents might not feel they are able to speak freely. You could ask the employee, “Is it okay if I talk to this person alone for a few minutes? I want to get an honest perspective.” Be wary if the employee denies access to the resident.  When you are on your tour, examine the facility. Is it clean and in good repair? Are the common areas tidy and inviting? Do the kitchen and bathrooms appear sanitary?Ask to see a resident’s room. Find out about cleanliness and upkeep expectations of residents’ personal spaces. Ask about the cleaning schedule. If residents are responsible for cleaning, ask how chores are determined and divided up among the residents.  Ask about house rules and the expectations for residents living there. You may want to ask about meals, curfews, or permissible behaviors.For example, if you are a smoker, find out if you are allowed to smoke in the house, in a designated area outside the house, or if smoking is not permitted anywhere on the property. Ask if the house has a curfew or if guests can stay overnight. Find out about meals. Do residents eat together, or are meals on your own? How do residents keep their food separate?  , If you like what you see and think the home will be a good fit for you, request to be interviewed by staff or residents. Expect that you will be drug-tested as part of your interview and as condition of your residency at the home.While you may interview with staff, at some sober living homes like an Oxford House, you will be interviewed by the residents of the home. Oxford Houses are supported by an umbrella agency, but are democratically run by each individual house’s residents. Rules at each house are set independently.Ask when you will be notified of a decision about your acceptance. You could say, “When can I follow up with you about this interview?”  

be sober.  decide what type of sober living home you need.  determine your budget.  find a sober living home in a good location.  get recommendations.  get opinions.  schedule a tour.  meet with residents.  inspect the premises.  find out what is expected of residents.  have an interview.

This serves the dual purpose of helping promote hair growth and keeping the hair you have strong and soft. Coconut oil, almond oil and castor oil are all thought to help hair grow in thick and strong. To do a conditioning treatment, follow these steps:Wet your hair and massage one to two tablespoons of oil into your scalp for five minutes. Run your fingers through your hair to distribute the oil from your roots to the tips of your hair. You can also use a wide-tooth comb. Cover your hair with a shower cap and let the oil soak in for one to two hours. Shampoo your hair as normal. You may have to wash it twice to remove excess oil.  If your hair is dry or thin, treating it with a nutritious mask can help restore its luster. A restorative hair mask may not help your hair grow quickly, but by protecting the hair you have, it will keep you from having to trim off split ends and take a step backward on your journey to having longer hair. Here's how to make a hair mask:Crack one egg into a bowl and beat it lightly. Mix in two tablespoons of plain yogurt and one tablespoon of honey. Apply to wet hair and let it sit for 20 minutes. Shampoo your hair as normal to wash out the mask.  This is a special type of brush made with natural fibers that closely resemble the texture of human hair. It is used to pull sebum, the natural oil secreted by your scalp, all the way to the tips of your hair. This protects your hair from roots to tips and keeps it healthy and strong. Here's how to use one:Place the brush against your scalp and rub it back and forth to massage your head and pick up your natural oil. In one long stroke, pull the brush from your roots to the tips of your hair. Keep stroking the same section of hair until it looks glossy and smooth. Continue this process section by section until you have massaged your entire scalp and brushed out all of your hair. Make sure you get a boar bristle brush. This doesn't work with plastic or metal brushes.  When your goal is to grow your hair out fast, it's important to pay attention to the products you use. Many products contain chemicals that can damage your hair and cause it to be dry and brittle. Aim to use products that are composed of mainly natural ingredients. Avoid products that contain the following:Sulfates: found in shampoo, these are harsh cleansers that strip your hair of natural oils and dry it out. Silicones: found in conditioner, these build up in your hair and cause it to look weighed down and dull. Alcohols: found in hairspray, gel and other styling products, these dry out your hair and cause it to get brittle.  Hair is mostly composed of protein, making it the most important component of a hair-healthy diet. Examine your diet and make sure you're getting plenty of protein every day. When your diet is protein deficient, your body doesn't produce as much hair.Eat lean meats, fish, eggs and dairy products high in protein. Beans, leafy greens and tofu are good sources of protein for vegetarians.  This is a B vitamin essential for hair growth. Since it is mostly found in animal products, vegetarians and vegans often find that they have a b vitamin deficiency. To make sure you get plenty of b vitamins in your diet, eat the following foods:Eggs, nuts, salmon, avocados, meat products and wheat bran. If you feel you aren't able to meet your b vitamin needs with food alone, consider taking a biotin supplement.  When you aren't getting enough vitamin A or C, your hair can become weak and dull. Make sure you're eating plenty of the following:   Sweet potatoes, carrots, kale, butternut squash and pumpkin, which are all rich in Vitamin A. Broccoli, leafy greens, peppers, and citrus fruits, which contain high amounts of Vitamin C.  These "good" fats support your scalp's health and promote healthy growth of hair and skin cells. Omega 3 fatty acid is found in salmon, sardines, mackerel, flax seeds and walnuts. You can take fish or flax seed oil supplements if you don't enjoy eating foods that are rich in omega 3s.  When your body is dehydrated, it shows in your hair. Your hair can become dry, brittle and more prone to breakage. When your hair breaks and frays, it's more difficult to grow it into the longer style you're after. Make sure you stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water every day.   Try replacing coffee, soda and alcoholic drinks with water whenever possible. Carry a water bottle with you throughout the day so you'll never have to go thirsty.  Sometimes hair loss or extremely slow growth has an underlying cause that can't be fixed using at-home methods. If you believe that your hair loss may be a symptom of a more serious illness, make an appointment with your doctor right away. Once you get the underlying problem treated, your hair should start to grow faster. Here are a few conditions that cause hair loss:Scalp infections or skin disorders Alopecia areata, a disorder that causes patchy hair loss Trichotillomania, a disorder that leads you to pull out your hair Certain medications cause hair loss Hormonal changes can cause hair loss  , Washing your hair every day can cause it to get dry and brittle. Each time you shampoo your hair, you wash away the protective oil that keeps it healthy and strong. When you're trying to grow your hair fast, it's best to wash your hair no more than once or twice a week.In between washes, use dry shampoo to keep your roots from looking oily. When you wash your hair, handle it gently. Don't scrub it or wring it out. Rinse with lukewarm or cool water instead of hot.  Air drying is really the healthiest choice when it comes to growing out your hair. Drying your hair with a hair dryer eventually weakens the hair shaft and leads to damage. The same goes for other heat styling tools like curling irons, flat irons and hot rollers.After your shower, pat your hair dry with a towel. Don't roughly towel it dry. Comb it out with a wide tooth comb. Apply product, such as leave-in conditioner, then let it fully air dry.  When your hair is wet, it stretches and breaks much more easily than when it is dry. That's why brushing your hair when it's wet is so damaging. It leads to breakage, frizz and split ends. Instead, use a wide tooth comb to gently detangle your hair. Start near the tips and work your way up to the roots, rather than dragging the comb down through your hair to pull out tangles.  Dyeing, bleaching, and chemically straightening your hair can cause a lot of damage. It's better to leave your hair in its natural state while you're trying to grow it out. You should also avoid hair styles that can pull out the hair, like tight weaves or braids.   If you're determined to lighten or color your hair, use a natural method that doesn't cause damage. Try lightening your hair with honey or dyeing it with henna. Learn to love your natural look. If your hair is curly or kinky, there's no natural method that will make it look perfectly straight. Fast-growing, free-flowing hair is beautiful.  The sun, air pollution, and pool chlorine are among the environmental elements that can damage your hair. If your hair is particularly fragile, it's a good idea to protect it, just as you would your skin.   When you go out in strong sun, wear a hat to cover your hair. If you live in a place with high air pollution, cover your hair with a scarf or hat while you're out on the city streets. When you swim in pools, wear a swim cap to protect your hair from chlorine. 

massage your scalp.  rub your scalp with essential oils.  do an oil conditioning treatment.  make a restorative hair mask.  use a boar bristle brush.  know what not to use on your hair.  eat plenty of protein.  eat biotin.  eat vitamins a and c. these vitamins help hair stay glossy and healthy.  eat omega 3 fatty acids.  stay hydrated.  see a doctor if your hair is falling out.  shampoo your hair less often.  don't use heat styling tools.  never brush your hair when it's wet.  avoid harsh hair treatments and styles.  protect it from the elements. 

 Although the symbol of the egg is rooted in a pagan springtime fertility feast, Christians have adopted the egg as an Easter symbol that represents new life. In many areas of the world, people color and decorate hard-boiled eggs as part of their Easter celebrations.  Once the eggs are decorated, children search for eggs hidden throughout their homes or gardens. In some traditions, the Easter Bunny hides the eggs on Easter morning for the children to find later that day.  Like the egg, the rabbit was a symbol of fertility associated with the pagan festival of Easter. In the 1500s, the Germans began using the Easter Hare as a symbol of rebirth at Easter. On the night before Easter, children would make nests from their bonnets and caps and leave them outside, where the Easter Hare would leave colorful eggs for them. Today, a common tradition is that the Easter Bunny brings baskets filled with candy to children on Easter morning.  The Germans are credited with inventing the chocolate Easter bunny in the 1800s. The chocolate bunny is now a traditional symbol of Easter. Other traditional types of Easter candy include chocolate eggs, marshmallow chicks and jelly beans.  The tradition of the Easter parade began in the 1800s as people walked down 5th Avenue in New York City after Easter Sunday church services. Now many cities offer Easter parades on Easter Sunday or the day before Easter.  The tradition of wearing new clothes on Easter dates back centuries, as people chose to celebrate new birth with new clothing. They referred to their new clothes as their "Easter best." Today, people around the world dress up in their finest attire for Easter church services. In many traditions, women wear white gloves and hats, which are often called Easter bonnets.

It will be much easier for others to forgive you, if you express remorse.Your apology should describe what you did wrong and how it hurt the person you are apologizing to.

Learning to communicate whole messages clearly will reduce misunderstandings and future conflict.Whole messages can be communicated with a simple formula: statement of fact (usually a description of an act) + your interpretation of what that fact means + how your interpretation makes you feel + how you would like the issue to be resolved. For example, "When you take my things without permission, I think you don't respect me or my belongings, which makes me feel angry. I will feel more comfortable with you borrowing my things, if we discuss it before you take them."  

admit your wrongdoing.  apologize to those you've wronged.  work to repair damage or repay debts.  communicate effectively with others.

 Your first step in putting together a proposal should be to gather as much information as you can. You will need to know about the property itself, but also about your target audience – the people who will judge the proposal. Try to put yourself in their shoes. What are their needs? What is their situation and knowledge level? The proposal should focus squarely on them and be as customized as possible.Try to get information on the property from the landlord or owner. Get copies of floor plans, site plans, copies of previous leases, rent rolls, tax records, income and expense statements. Check to see if the property has sold recently. If so, note the price trends. This data will be crucial to analyzing the property, valuing it, and then putting together a marketing strategy.If you are responding to a Request for Proposal or RFP, carefully study the request’s requirements. Let them direct your research, so that you can respond to them in your proposal.; , One important part of your research will be to look into the local market. Market research will give you indicators of value and rental rates, which can be compared to the proposed listing. This information will not only be key in presenting to the prospect but also in marketing the listing.   For example, find similar sales and lease transactions and take note of the prices. Comparable transactions will help you to value your listing and then, in your proposal, to justify that value.  Take all of the documents you’ve compiled and review them. Often, you will find inaccuracies. Whether these errors help or hurt the listing’s marketability, it is your job to fix them in order to give the most accurate information to your clients and to potential buyers or tenants.  Put together a description of the property and its location, highlighting the merits of owning or leasing it. Be careful of how you use language in the description. Favor words that paint a picture and avoid those that may dampen a reader’s interest like “vacant,” “must sell,” or “value.”Include attractive photos. These are a very important visual aid in pitching the property. In fact, photos are better at conveying a sense of the property than just words. Have a list of basic repair and checks that will improve the property’s value – things like painting or updating the landscaping. These should be simple and give a good return on the investment of time and money., Take all of the data you’ve gathered in your research and begin to put it into logical order for your proposal. There may be a lot to manage. Don’t get overwhelmed. Rather, try to find ways to sort the information. Lay the documents out on the floor or on top of your desk, for example, so that you can easily find them.   Potential buyers or leasers will be more interested in some information than in others, like price and valuation. Keep in mind who you are talking to – your audience. Put yourself in their place. Given their business and aims, what will they most want to know? Prioritize this information. Also sketch out talking points. Use these in your pitch so that you can show that you’ve done a thorough job, that you understand the value of the property, and that you are the best person for the listing.  Real estate proposals usually have a standard format, following a four-part structure. Generally, you’ll want to have an introduction of yourself and the proposal. A summary of the property and its situation follows and then a description of your ideas and the services that you are offering, including costs and other important details. Only after this should you add information to gain the reader’s trust, like your credentials, experience, education, and awards.The different sections are all important. Start with a client and property brief. This section is short and summarizes the client and what the property offers. It should show that you fully understand what the client needs and how the property can meet their requirements, in addition to provide an accurate description of the property as it currently stands.For the meat of the proposal, you’ll need to bring together all of your data and analysis. You should by now have identified the property’s key assets and features. Explain to your client you valuation and how you envision the target market. Who will you market the property to? What is its size? How will you attract potential buyers? These recommendations should be specific.Finally, talk about yourself, fees, and what you can offer last. At least 75% of the document should be about the property and client, not about you. Make sure that the fees you propose are at least close to parity with what is charged in the local real estate market.  The last part of the process is the touching up. Visuals will make your report stand out and be easy to understand. Each page should have graphs or charts to break down the data into understandable parts. Photos will also help. Many clients won’t read the entire document anyway, so spare them from wordiness.Last, add a final covering page called an "executive summary.” This is a short, 1 to 2 page overview that brings together all of the most key items about the property and its marketing. Make it as clear and easy for the client to understand. Consider using bullet points, for example. This section will give the first and most important impression. 

gather information.  research market data.  review and verify all documents.  write a detailed description.  compile your information.  format the proposal.  polish the report and add an "executive summary."

There are four main skin types:   Normal: This is considered the best skin type. It is has a good oil/water balance, with no impurities, or fine lines. Dry: This skin type has very tight pores, due to lack of oil. While it will not have any impurities, it tends to mature faster, and develop fine lines faster. Combination: Parts of the face are oily, while other parts are dry(usually the T Zone((the forehead, nose, and chin area))is the oily part, while the cheeks are the dry part). Oily: this skin type, has an overabundance of oil. Although this skin type matures the slowest, it usually has a shiny surface and multiple impurities. , Exfoliating is good for the skin as it sloughs away dead cells from the skin which accumulate, and prevents newer cells from growing.

 It may seem fairly obvious, but if you're suffering from fatigue, the first and foremost step is to ensure that you are getting enough sleep every night.   It's estimated that two-thirds of people experience sleep problems at some point in their lives, and these sleep problems negatively affect their energy levels, mood and work performance the next day.Therefore it's important that you go to bed at a reasonable hour, to ensure that you get at least 7, and ideally 8 hours sleep per night. If you have trouble getting to sleep (no matter how tired you are), there are several adjustments you should make to your night-time routine.  Aside from getting enough sleep, it's important that you try to go to sleep and wake up at approximately the same time every day (even on weekends).   This helps to set your body clock to a regular schedule - for example, if you go to bed at 10 pm and wake up at 6 am every day, your body will soon adjust to and accept this new schedule and you will naturally feel sleepy at 10 and awake and refreshed at 6. However, if you follow an erratic sleeping schedule - waking up and going to bed at a different time each day - your body will be out of sync and you may have difficulty falling asleep at night and a hard time staying awake during the day.  It's also important to make sure that your bedroom is a comfortable, relaxing space where sleep is the main focus.   Ensure that the temperature is comfortable for sleeping in - not too hot or not too cold. Invest in a fan or just open a window if your room is stuffy, as sleeping in a hot room is not conducive to good sleep. Try to eliminate all sources of light - the window, electric lights and any blinking or LED lights on alarm clocks, televisions, or other electrical devices. If you don't want to turn them off, just cover them with a thick cloth. Reduce noise levels as much as possible.Close your bedroom door and ask anyone still awake to keep the television/music turned down. If you find it difficult to drown out noise from the street, consider buying a white noise machine or just play some ambient music.  Although a cup of coffee here and there can certainly help you to fight fatigue throughout the day, drinking too much or drinking it too close to bedtime can negatively impact your sleep.   Some people don't realize the effects that caffeine has on their sleep quality and generally energy levels. To figure it out, try slowly cutting coffee and other caffeinated drinks (black tea, cola and energy drinks) from your diet over a three week period to see if you notice any increase in your energy levels. Even if you seem to have a high tolerance for caffeine and are not keen on the idea of giving up your morning coffee, it's a good idea to stop drinking any caffeinated drinks at least 5 hours before bedtime. Switch to decaffeinated versions instead., Although it seems like a nice idea to watch television, play a computer game or surf the net on your laptop or iPad to unwind before bed, these activities can actually do more harm than good.   The bright lights produced by these devices actually trick the brain into believing it's daytime, which prevents your body from producing the hormones (notably melatonin) responsible for inducing sleep. In addition, watching action, thriller or horror movies/TV shows right before bed gets your heart racing, stimulating the body and brain and making sleep impossible. Therefore, you should make an effort to switch off all technological devices at least an hour before bed and partake in a more relaxing activity instead. Try reading a book (although not from a backlit e-reader), meditating or listening to music.  Taking a warm bath before bed is believed to be very effective at inducing sleep, for two main reasons:   Firstly, a hot bath helps you to relax and forget about the stresses and worries of the day - worries which are often responsible for keeping you awake at night. Secondly, the rise in body temperature (when you're in the bath) followed by the rapid drop (when you get out) mimics the body-cooling hormones your brain releases when you fall asleep. Take a bath for at least 20 to 30 minutes before bed, and try to ensure that the water temperature is at least 100 degree F, or as hot as you can handle without scalding yourself! Keep in mind that a hot bath is not recommended for people with diabetes, gynecologic problems, low blood pressure, heart failure, varicose veins as well as during pregnancy. Add some aromatic essential oils, such as lavender or chamomile to the water, light some candles and play some soothing music for extra relaxation value!  , If you're really feeling exhausted throughout the day, consider taking a short nap, as it can really work wonders for your energy levels. Keep it short and sweet through - 10 minutes to 30 minutes, max.   If you nap for too long, you may wake up feeling groggy and have difficulty sleeping that night. A short power nap, however, can boost energy levels and leave you feeling more awake and productive. Also try following up your nap with a small cup of coffee and a quick snack for an added energy boost.  

get at least 7 hours sleep a night.  stick to a sleeping schedule.  make sure your room is comfortable.  don't drink caffeine for at least 5 hours before bed.  avoid using technology before bed.  take a warm bath.  if necessary, take a nap. 

 A macho guy can take care of himself and his family. If you want to cultivate a macho persona, learn to do more things for yourself and rely on others less for basic tasks. Can you change the oil in your car or do you take it to the shop? A macho guy should know how to intelligently approach any situation that calls for it without panicking. Here's a brief list of macho stuff it would be good for any guy to know:   take care of your car         fix a leaky faucet        throw a knife        cook a steak properly        shoot a gun        drink whiskey        shave with a straight razor        find water        butcher meat        survive in the wilderness        win a fight      ; , Playing Xbox is fun and all, but there are probably more macho things you could be doing. A macho guy gets outside and does things with his hands. Masculine hobbies can be a great way of bonding with other men and feeling the testosterone flow freely. Try out a few macho activities to see what you like:   fishing        soccer        golfing        boxing        motorcycling        reading        skeet-shooting        , A macho guy is an intelligent guy who makes learning as much as he can about something a big priority. Whether it's for work or a hobby, you should actively try to learn and master a subject. People should want to come to you for help because of your expertise in a particular subject, not the other way around.Never take others down for knowing more than you do about something. It doesn't make you macho to treat ignorance like it's some kind of "cool" thing, it just makes you stupid. If you're really talented, you'll be able to back up your talk with action. Bragging to your friends about how great you are in the sack, how fast your new car goes, or how great your outside jump shot is may be macho, or it may just be a load of lies. Brag about something worth bragging about.  Being macho is no fun if you don't have an A-team of like-minded macho dudes ready to stomp around the woods getting wild and howling at the moon with. Every man needs other men to bro-down with and get in touch with their jerky-eating, beer-swilling, shadow-boxing, knife-wielding genes. Get some macho friends and do macho things.  Find masculine role models that you respect and learn from them. If you're learning a trade, apprentice yourself to a man that you admire personally and professionally and learn everything you can from him. Spend time with your male family members to get to know them a little better. Try to strengthen your relationship with your father, your uncles, and your male cousins. Blood between macho men should be thick.  When a macho guy scores a touchdown, he calmly walks over to the referee, hands him the ball, and gets back to the scrimmage. Business as usual. Showing off is for guys who have to compensate, because macho guys are cool and detached and unaffected. A macho guy should look like you'd want to give him the leadership role when the post-apocalypse goes down, because he's the one staring into the crowd of zombies with a bored smirk. Macho guys should neither be crushed by a failure or overcome by a success. Treat anything that happens, good or bad, as a curiosity.  If you ever have to cry in public, be stoic and calm, speaking without a cracking voice. Macho tears are like rain in the desert: it should be shocking, but not unappreciated. People will know the situation is serious if a macho guy like you is shedding a single gravely tear.  Being macho doesn't mean you have to drive your car recklessly, drink too much, and treat everyone like dirt. A real man acts like himself, stands up for what he believes in, and is a genuine person, first and foremost. A real macho guy isn't putting on an act, he's just being a man.  

learn to be self-reliant.  enjoy manly hobbies.  be an expert at something.  form solid relationships with other men.  withhold excessive displays of emotion.  be yourself. 

 For the record, this isn't a very strong dye and is only suitable for light colored wood, such as pine. The end result will look "weathered.” Make sure it is as strong a brew as possible; the darker the coffee, the darker the dye effect.   Dyeing a dining room table that seats 14? You may need more than just a pot.  These will be used as part of the dye, making it richer and deeper – and that translates to fewer coats for you to spread.   Before you go to dip your rag or paintbrush in the coffee, you may want to put on rubber or plastic gloves to keep coffee stains off your hands.  While the coffee is still warm (not hot), use a paintbrush or rag dipped into the coffee and apply it to the wood. Rub or paint back and forth, across the wood.   Don't worry about the grounds; press them in if you can but just keep moving back and forth. Leave the grounds in place for darker dyeing.  If you're working with a smaller object, arrange on paper towels or towels to dry. Some coffee may drip down the sides, depending on your process. This is generally fine, as it will give it a perfectly-imperfect look.  After a few layers, the effect can be quite evident. Reheat the coffee until it's warm again to bring back its potency, and reapply.   Remember to let it dry before you apply another layer. It will be slightly darker when wet. If you like the current shade, consider sealing it with polyurethane spray or a wood varnish. This will help the color last longer, give it a sheen, and protect it against the elements.  

brew a pot of coffee.  add the grounds back into the coffee pot.  remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.  allow to dry.  add more layers until the color or effect is as you'd like it. 

 Remember that first impressions are difficult to undo. If you will be the first person greeting new people, put on a smile for them when they arrive. Smiles indicate warmth and friendliness and can make people feel more comfortable.If your guest is greeted with a happy gesture, they are more likely to feel happy. Encourage other members of your group or office to greet these new people with a smile, as well.; , Try exchanging simple introductions. Simply approach the newcomer and tell them your name and title if you are on the job or at an organization’s meeting.   You might say something like “Hi, my name is Rebekah and I’m the Treasurer of this organization. What’s your name?” Try to get to any newcomers as quickly as possible so they are not walking around aimlessly with no one to talk to.  After your brief introduction, you will want to find out more about your guest. In general, people enjoy speaking about themselves, so allow your guest to do so. Ask them their name, what they do, how they heard about your organization, and any other questions you might find pertinent.You might say something like “So what’s your name?” and when they reply ask “How did you hear about our organization?”  , During this welcoming process, be mindful that not all people are equipped to be social constantly. Many introverts need some time to themselves to recharge. Provide a space that has games, puzzles, or pamphlets so that these guests and others can take a breather.Choose games that most people enjoy and that are quick and easy to play. Make sure any and all pamphlets that you have are up to date.  Let them know that you are available if they have any questions at all or just want to talk. If you have a listserv that announces any upcoming dates in your organization or office, see if they would like to be added to that so they can stay informed.   You can also tell them to reach out to you on social media.  If your organization has a website, make sure that this information is updated regularly so that newcomers can stay up to date. Having misinformation on your site can make you look disorganized and it can deter new membership.Ensure that you have one concise website rather than multiple. The same goes for social media, as well.  

smile.  introduce yourself.  ask them about themselves.  provide a space for introverts.  give them your contact info.  make current information easily accessible.

 Ask the woman if there's anything you can do to make her more comfortable in the car. For safety reasons, it's important that she buckles up. She may feel more at ease if she sits in the back seat where she can stretch out.You may want to keep blankets and pillows in the car to make her even more comfortable.  If the woman's water hasn't broken, be prepared in case it breaks while you're driving. Lay a thick towel down on the seat and have a few more in case she needs to wipe herself off as well. You should also travel with a plastic bag for the woman to use if she develops nausea and needs something to vomit into.Some women may still experience leaking even after their waters break, so it's a good idea to put down a towel anyway.  Play relaxing music or use scents that soothe the laboring woman so her labor continues to progress. Many women find that the stress of traveling to the hospital causes the labor to stall or temporarily stop. Consider spritzing a little perfume or essential oils in the car and turn on soft music. These can relax her and help her labor progress.It's alright if her labor slows down a little. This just means that it may take more time for her labor to pick back up at the hospital. Some laboring women prefer quiet, so ask the woman if she'd rather you turn the music off.  Avoid speeding, running lights, and reckless driving that could put your car and others in danger. Instead, follow the traffic laws to ensure that you make it safely to the hospital. You may even want to drive slower if this makes the woman in labor more comfortable.Try to go slower over bumps, railroad tracks, or through construction. The jostling may be painful for the laboring woman, so taking it slowly can make it easier to handle.  The laboring woman will pick up on your stress and nervousness which could stall her labor (making it temporarily slow down). Try to remain in control, calm, and confident so she can focus on making it through contractions. Practice any breathing exercises you learned birthing classes, repeat a mantra, or visualize a safe arrival at the hospital.Remember that it's alright if you don't feel calm and confident. You just need to display outward control of the situation. Once she realizes that you can safely get her to the hospital, she'll feel more comfortable.  

make the woman comfortable.  protect the car from messes.  play soothing music.  obey the traffic laws.  remain calm. 

 In order to make a baby’s breath crown using the stem of the flowers as the base, you need to choose a bunch of baby’s breath that has a long stem. The stem should be long enough to wrap around your head and fit like a crown., Cut off all of the smaller bunches of baby’s breath that shoot off of the main stem. You can either cut them with scissors or just twist them off using your hands. Set these small bunches aside because they will eventually be attached to the crown., Directly under the small bunch of baby’s breath at the end of the stalk, tape another small bunch of baby’s breath to the stalk. Continue to tape small bunches of baby’s breath to the stalk until it is long enough to fit as a crown.Be sure to tuck in the stems with tape, so that you do not have any stems sticking out of the crown.  Once you have reached the end of the stalk, carefully bend it into a circle to create the shape of the crown. Use floral tape to attach the two ends together.You can then fill in any gaps with more baby’s breath. Simply attach small bunches using the floral tape.

 If you're suffering from an asthma attack, you'll need something to treat your symptoms as quickly as possible. Your doctor may recommend quick-relief medications, which are intended for short-term, as-needed use to relieve an active asthma attack.However, you are using these medications more than twice per week, then you may need other medications such as inhaled steroids.Short-acting beta agonists are inhaled bronchodilators that help improve your lungs' function within minutes. Medicines in this class include albuterol (ProAir HFA or Ventolin HFA) and levalbuterol (Xopenex). Ipratropium (Atrovent) is a fast-acting bronchodilator that is typically reserved for individuals with emphysema and bronchitis but may be used for severe asthma. Corticosteroids like prednisone and methylprednisolone may be administered orally or via injection. These medications quickly relieve the symptoms of an asthma attack, but prolonged use can cause serious side effects.; , While quick-relief medications can help an active asthma attack, they will not do much to manage your asthma on a long-term basis. For this reason, your doctor may also prescribe one or more long-term medications to help control your condition.Leukotriene modifiers are oral medications that can treat symptoms for up to 24 hours at a time. Medications in this class include montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate), and zileuton (Zyflo). Long-acting beta agonists are inhaled medicines used to dilate the airways. Common beta agonists include salmeterol (Serevent) and formoterol (Foradil). Combination inhalers pair long-acting beta agonists with a corticosteroid, though they may increase the risk of a severe asthma attack. Common medications include fluticasone-salmeterol (Advair) and budesonide-formoterol (Symbicort).  Allergy medication will not directly treat asthma or nocturnal asthma, but they are commonly used for allergy control. Common OTC preparations include Zyrtec (cetirizine), Claritin (loratadine) and Allegra (fexofenadine). However, if your asthma is triggered by or exaggerated by allergies, your doctor may recommend that you take a prescription allergy medication.Allergy shots, also known as immunotherapy, involve your doctor administering small doses of a given allergen to reduce your immune system's reaction to it. This may start at once a week, then gradually move to once a month. Omalizumab (Xolair) is a medication that is administered via injection every two to four weeks. This medication is specifically made for people who suffer from both allergies and severe asthma. Inhaled corticosteroids have an anti-inflammatory effect on your airways. Common corticosteroids include fluticasone (Flonase or Flovent), budesonide (Rhinocort), flunisolide (Aerospan HFA), and ciclesonide (Alvesco).  Dust mites are a common trigger for people with nocturnal asthma. While you cannot guarantee a completely dust-free environment, you can reduce the risk of nocturnal triggers by keeping your bedroom as clean as possible.Dust your room at least once each week to keep dust to a minimum. If you're worried about exposure while cleaning you can wear a disposable dust mask.Vacuum your rugs regularly. When you change your sheets and pillowcases, you can also vacuum your pillows and mattress. Change your sheets and pillowcases regularly to prevent the buildup of dust and dust mites. You can also purchase special dustproof covers for your pillows and mattress. These protect your sleep area from dust and dust mites.  Carpets provide ample space for dust and dust mites to gather, even if you clean regularly. The best way to reduce dust in your bedroom is to remove any carpeting in that room and install hardwood floors or linoleum tiles., The air that you breathe can have a tremendous effect on your asthma. Instead of leaving the windows open or breathing in damp air, you can treat the air in your bedroom to make it more conducive to your condition.Use an air conditioner instead of opening the windows. This reduces your exposure to pollen and dust while also lowering the humidity in your bedroom. If you live in an area that is prone to damp or humid weather, consider using a dehumidifier in your home to pull excess moisture out of the air.  Mold spores can aggravate your asthma at any time of day or night. The best way to reduce your exposure is to be proactive in how you tackle mold problems in and around your home.Keep the windows closed, especially at night. This is when mold spores are most active in the air.Dry and disinfect damp areas around your home, including in the bathroom and kitchen. Remove piles of leaves or damp firewood from your yard.  Getting regular checkups for your asthma is the best way to keep it under control. Having nocturnal asthma symptoms is a sign that your asthma is not well-controlled, so you should see your doctor as soon as possible. Your doctor can use different tests to check your asthma and adjust your medications as needed.  If it has been a while since you last saw your doctor, then make an appointment today.  Some factors are known to cause asthma attacks in individuals with any type of asthma.In people with nocturnal asthma, exposure to those triggers before and during sleep could be a significant factor.Common asthma triggers include, but are not limited to:   Tobacco smoke Exposure to cold air Scented items, especially perfume and cologne Airborne particles, including hairspray and other chemicals  , Though there are multiple factors that could cause nocturnal asthma attacks, some experts believe that your body position during sleep could be a factor.Try adjusting the way you lie down when you go to sleep and find a position that seems to work best for you.  Experts generally advise that living a healthy lifestyle can help reduce the incidence of asthma attacks in many individuals.While this won't prevent asthma attacks from occurring, it will improve your health and may help you manage your symptoms.   Try to reduce your emotional stress and anxiety levels, as these are tied to asthma symptoms in many people. Get adequate rest each night. This may be difficult if your nocturnal asthma interrupts your sleep, so try to plan accordingly by giving yourself more sleep time than you typically need. Eat a balanced, healthy diet. For help planning a healthy diet, you may want to consult with a nutritionist. Some experts recommend incorporating exercise into your lifestyle to help maintain your health. However, exercise may actually trigger an asthma attack in some individuals., Some individuals may experience an asthma attack after exposure to pet dander. Having asthma does not necessarily mean you will need to get rid of an existing pet or that you won't be able to get one in the future. However, you will need to take precautions to limit how much dander your pet leaves around the house.Bathe furry pets once a week to reduce the amount of dander on their coats. If furry pets are a problem for your allergies, consider keeping them outside your bedroom as much as possible. Vacuum rugs often. You should also sweep and mop hard floor surfaces at least once each week. Furry pets are not the only animals that can cause complications. Some people find that bird feathers can also aggravate asthma symptoms.If your symptoms worsen in spite of taking precautions, you may need to avoid exposure to these pets altogether. Talk to a friend or relative about taking care of your pet if you are no longer able to.  Long-term management of your asthma symptoms will require you to keep regular contact with your doctor. The frequency of your doctor's visits will vary, depending on the severity of your asthma and how well under control your condition is at any given time.Follow up with your doctor every two to six weeks when you're first getting control of your condition. Once your asthma is under control, schedule appointments for every one to six months. Keep these appointments indefinitely so your doctor can continue to assess your condition.  Some medications are known to trigger or aggravate asthma symptoms in some individuals. These include over-the-counter medications like aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen. Beta-blockers, which are prescribed for heart disease and high blood pressure, are also known to trigger asthma attacks in some individuals.If you must take pain medication or beta-blockers for another medical condition, talk to your doctor about alternative medications that will not trigger your asthma. Check the side effects of any new medication you are considering to ensure that it will not have any adverse effects on your asthma.  If you suffer from allergies or if you find that allergens affect your asthma, you may need to see an allergist. An allergist can help you identify your particular allergies, work on allergen immunotherapy, and advise you on how to avoid known allergens.Ask your doctor for a referral to a recommended allergist. You can also find allergists in your area by searching online or checking your phone book, but you may still need a referral from your primary doctor.  

use quick-relief medications.  take long-term asthma control medications.  try allergy medications.  keep your bedroom clean.  remove carpets from your bedroom.  treat the air in your room.  reduce your exposure to mold.  see your doctor regularly.  avoid known triggers.  try different body positions.  live a healthy lifestyle.  limit exposure to pet dander.  keep regular doctor's appointments.  ask your doctor about your medications.  see an allergist. 

 Because you will be running an operating system from within your own operating system, VMware Workstation has fairly high system requirements. If you don’t meet these, you may not be able to run VMware effectively.   You must have a 64-bit processor. VMware supports Windows and Linux operating systems. You must have enough memory to run your operating system, the virtual operating system, and any programs inside that operating system. 1 GB is the minimum, but 3 or more is recommended. You must have a 16-bit or 32-bit display adapter. 3D effects will most likely not work well inside the virtual operating system, so gaming is not always efficient. You need at least 1.5 GB of free space to install VMware Workstation, along with at least 1 GB per operating system that you install.; , You can download the VMware installer from the Download Center on the VMware website. Select the newest version and click the link for the installer. You will need to login with your VMware username.   You will be asked to read and review the license agreement before you can download the file. You can only have one version of VMware Workstation installed at a time.  Once you have downloaded the file, right-click on the file and select “Run as administrator”.You will be asked to review the license again. Most users can use the Typical installation option. At the end of the installation, you will be prompted for your license key. Once the installation is finished, restart the computer.  Installing a virtual operating system is much like installing it on a regular PC. You will need to have the installation disc or ISO image as well as any necessary licenses for the operating system that you want to install.   You can install most distributions of Linux as well as any version of Windows.  Select New Virtual Machine and then choose Typical. VMware will prompt you for the installation media. If it recognizes the operating system, it will enable Easy Installation:   Physical disc – Insert the installation disc for the operating system you want to install and then select the drive in VMware. ISO image – Browse to the location of the ISO file on your computer. Install operating system later. This will create a blank virtual disk. You will need to manually install the operating system later.  For Windows and other licensed operating systems, you will need to enter your product key. You will also need to enter your preferred username and a password if you want one.   If you are not using Easy Install, you will need to browse the list for the operating system you are installing.  The name will help you identify it on your physical computer. It will also help distinguish between multiple virtual computers running different operating systems.  You can allocate any amount of free space on your computer to the virtual machine to act as the installed operating system’s hard drive. Make sure to set enough to install any programs that you want to run in the virtual machine.  You can set the virtual machine to emulate specific hardware by clicking the “Customize Hardware” button. This can be useful if you are trying to run an older program that only supports certain hardware. Setting this is optional.  Check the box labeled “Power on this virtual machine after creation” if you want the virtual machine to start up as soon as you finish making it. If you don’t check this box, you can select your virtual machine from the list in VMware and click the Power On button.  Once you’ve powered on the virtual machine for the first time, the operating system will begin to install automatically. If you provided all of the correct information during the setup of the virtual machine, then you should not have to do anything.   If you didn’t enter your product key or create a username during the virtual machine setup, you will most likely be prompted during the installation of the operating system.  Once the operating system is installed, the program VMware Tools should be automatically installed. Check that it appears on the desktop or in the program files for the newly installed operating system.   VMware tools are configuration options for your virtual machine, and keeps your virtual machine up to date with any software changes.  To start a virtual machine, click the VM menu and select the virtual machine that you want to turn on. You can choose to start the virtual machine normally, or boot directly to the virtual BIOS.  To stop a virtual machine, select it and then click the VM menu. Select the Power option.   Power Off – The virtual machine turns off as if the power was cut out. Shut Down Guest – This sends a shutdown signal to the virtual machine which causes the virtual machine to shut down as if you had selected the shutdown option. You can also turn off the virtual machine by using the shutdown option in the virtual operating system.  Moving files between your computer and the virtual machine is as simple as dragging and dropping. Files can be moved in both directions between the computer and the virtual machine, and can also be dragged from one virtual machine to another.   When you drag and drop, the original will stay in the original location and a copy will be created in the new location. You can also move files by copying and pasting. Virtual machines can connect to shared folders as well.  You can add any printer to your virtual machine without having to install any extra drivers, as long as it is already installed on your host computer.   Select the virtual machine that you want to add the printer to. Click the VM menu and select Settings. Click the Hardware tab, and then click Add. This will start the Add Hardware wizard. Select Printer and then click Finish. Your virtual printer will be enabled the next time you turn the virtual machine on.  Virtual machines can interact with a USB drive the same way that your normal operating system does. The USB drive cannot be accessed on both the host computer and the virtual machine at the same time.   If the virtual machine is the active window, the USB drive will be automatically connected to the virtual machine when it is plugged in. If the virtual machine is not the active window or is not running, select the virtual machine and click the VM menu. Select Removable Devices and then click Connect. The USB drive will automatically connect to your virtual machine.  A snapshot is a saved state and will allow you to load the virtual machine to that precise moment as many times as you need.   Select your virtual machine, click the VM menu, hover over Snapshot and select Take Snapshot. Give your Snapshot a name. You can also give it a description, though this is optional. Click OK to save the Snapshot. Load a saved Snapshot by clicking the VM menu and then selecting Snapshot. Choose the Snapshot you wish to load from the list and click Go To., A combination of the "Ctrl" and other keys are used to navigate virtual machines. For example, "Ctrl," "Alt" and "Enter" puts the current virtual machine in full screen mode or moves through multiple machines. "Ctrl," "Alt" and "Tab" will move between virtual machines when the mouse is being used by 1 machine.  

make sure your computer meets the system requirements.  download the vmware software.  install vmware workstation.  open vmware.  click file.  enter in the details for the operating system.  name your virtual machine.  set the disk size.  customize your virtual machine’s virtual hardware.  set the virtual machine to start.  wait for your installation to complete.  check that vmware tools is installed.  start a virtual machine.  stop a virtual machine.  move files between the virtual machine and your physical computer.  add a printer to your virtual machine.  connect a usb drive to the virtual machine.  take a snapshot of a virtual machine.  become familiar with keyboard shortcuts. 

 Before you invest money on new blank DVD, do a little research and get to know which formats are compatible with your devices. Knowing this before you purchase a huge pack of discs will prevent frustrating and costly mistakes.   DVD+R means the disc is rewritable and you can (with appropriate software) delete files off the disc and replace with new ones. The file will just hide under the new ones and take up some disc space.  DVD-R means the disc is not erasable and cannot be reused although files can be copied to another drive and burned on a new disc.  ROM means it's Read Only Media that can not be erased and is permanently burned onto the disc.  RW states the old file is erased completely taking no disc space at all after being rewritten or re-burned.; , Not every DVD disc is made for burning with a computer and some discs will allow you burn a movie and menus of a dvd on the disc but not work in DVD players.   Note which brands work better on the devices too. Some players are finicky about the brands of disc being played in them. Also some brands are thicker and more durable than others. Professional movie discs are an expensive grade of disc.  

learn what formats of disc are suitable for your drive, burning software, purpose, and devices, as well as the playback equipment you intend to view it on.  look at the format symbols/icons on the packaging, the disc themselves, in the device user manuals or the device. 

 Here's a short description of the most common ones.  Job 1-The Santa Jr. The job is usually to actually arrange the gifts and presents.        Job 2-The Sandman/woman. The job is to get the kids to sleep A.S.A.P.       Job 3-The Night guard Elf. The job is simple, keep watch of kids room, and make sure they don't come out and look, even though the kids are most likely(and should be) asleep. This is often paired with Job 2.       Job 4- Stocking Stuffer. The job is to fill the stockings. Often this is paired with Job 1.       Job 5-The Gabber. The job is to keep the kids in bed and keep them from finding out you're helping Santa this year. This is often paired with Jobs 2 and 3.      ; , This will give you time to prepare.  This way when Christmas Eve comes you know their bedtime routines and what to expect, and it won't seem as strange to them if it's you putting them to bed instead of their mom or dad.       Job 3: No preparation necessary.       Job 4: No preparation necessary.       Job 5: Think up any questions the kids might ask and how you will answer them. If one of the kids says to you "If all the reindeer get sick on Christmas Eve, how does Santa get anywhere?" how will you answer it?        , Are they light or deep sleepers? Do they go to bed quick or make excuses to stay up?  , See the Tips and Warnings for more info  

your parents or the parents of a child you're staying with will probably give you a certain job.  if you are going to have to have a job to do on christmas eve, try to find out as far beforehand as possible.  if you do have time to prepare, this is what you should do, depending on your job:  job 1: no preparation necessary  job 2: get the kids to bed at least a few times beforehand.  get to know the kids you will be with.  make sure you know your jobs hazards and the good sides.

 As long as you wash them after use, you can reuse plugs made from silicone, plastic, or rubber multiple times. However, you'll first need to figure out your size. Reusable plastic ear plugs are sometimes marketed as "one size fits all" while some come in sizes ranging from small to large. You can try a "one size fits all" to start, but may have to do some trial and error before you find the right size for your ears.   You may need different sized plugs for each ear. This is not uncommon, so don't be surprised if you have to buy two different types of plugs. It may be a good idea to buy a few packs of plugs in different sizes and see what works for your ears.  Before attempting to insert a reusable ear plug, read the instructions that came with your package thoroughly. How you insert reusable ear plugs varies depending on the precise shape of your plugs. For the most part, the process of inserting a reusable plug is very similar; however, it's a good idea to review your instructions for any special considerations regarding your specific type of plug., Reach over your head with one hand. Grab the top of your ear and pull up and back.This will pull your ear open a bit more, which makes the plug easier to insert.  Once you've expanded your ear drum, insert the ear plug using a gentle, rocking motion. Rock the plug back and forth to slowly push it into the canal. Keep going until you've sealed off the ear canal.         Make sure you do not push the plug in too far. Most of the plug should be in the canal, but you should still be able to easily grab the plug with your fingertips when you need to remove it. If you can still hear well with the plug in place, you may have inserted it incorrectly. Refer to the instructions manual and try again. If the plug still does not work after a second attempt, you may need a different size plug.  

purchase the right size ear plugs.if you use ear plugs a lot, it may make sense to purchase reusable plugs.  read the instructions first.  pull your ear up and back to straighten your ear canal.  insert the plug using a rocking motion. 

 Whether you share her beliefs or not, it's crucial to be honest with her and stay true to yourself. Try to get to know each other outside of a spiritual context, and understand how her faith influences her character. You should connect as people, first and foremost.The more honest you are about your own beliefs, the better. Even if you're not Christian, she will respond to your sincerity, and you may discover that a religious difference isn't a deal-breaker. Approach the subject of your respective beliefs directly by saying "I understand why you believe what you do, but I have to say that I..." or "that's interesting. I feel that..."; , It may be that her beliefs don't permit her to do certain things, like going out for drinks, or that her involvement in the church gives her a chance to take part in certain activities. Ask her about her interests and hobbies and see what the two of you have in common.Do things that make her feel enriched. If she's a lover of nature, invite her on a hike or picnic; if she's an art aficionado, visit a museum together and have her explain the exhibits to you. Find ways to indulge the passions that complement her faith. Be prepared for her idea of a good time to differ from your own. She may not drink alcohol or find an inappropriate sense of humor funny. Be mindful of the ways that her beliefs guide her relationships and act accordingly.  If you're also Christian, the two of you already have plenty to talk about. If not, explore other similarities in your interests and personal beliefs that help you relate to one another. You may be alike in many other ways that count.You may, for instance, find yourself agreeing on philosophical issues outside of any religious framework. These are compelling values that will allow the two of you to relate. Learn what her stance is on a particular topic or issue. Ask her "what do you believe about...?" or "how do you feel about...?" and then propose a topic that you want to find out more about. Be careful not to offend, however. Religious and moral issues can be challenging to discuss with someone you don't yet know very well.  Without interrogating her, try to discover her views on dating as it relates to her religion. Some denominations of Christianity take different approaches to activities such as dating that continue to evolve in a modern setting. It can be helpful to know how things like long-term expectations and her personal conditions for dating will proceed from the outset.  Start off with something casual, like coffee and conversation or a long walk. Take the opportunity to learn more about her and spend some time alone. A casual setting will make it easier to talk about intimate topics, and give you a trial run to see if you're a good fit for each other.Just because she's Christian doesn't mean she's not capable of having fun. Get creative. Think of activities you can do together that challenge and exhilarate you. Most of the things you would do on an ordinary date are just as acceptable here.  Make her comfortable by letting her know she has nothing to hide or feel self-conscious about. Discussing religious beliefs with new acquaintances can be awkward. Just remember that everyone has their own convictions that play a part in what they're like—these are hers.Reinforce her willingness to be open with you. When disagreements arise, reassure her with statements like: "even though we don't believe the same things, I support and care about you, and want to know more about what you think." Knowing that you're receptive to her views will make her much more comfortable sharing them with you. Talk to her about your own beliefs as well. It's probably just as important for her to know what your moral values are. This is an element of dating that people downplay or postpone all too often, and it should be given special consideration in a relationship with a religious foundation. Even if you share the same faith, differences in denomination or church liturgy may exist. Get these differences out in the open and do your best to be accepting of them.  Prove to her that you care enough to at least make an effort to find out more about her lifestyle. Her faith is likely the central priority in her life, the way work or a passion or project might be for someone else. Keep an open mind and see what it's all about.   If you're not the religious type, this step may prove difficult. If it makes you uncomfortable to continue accompanying her to church, let her know and explain your reasons to her.  Get to know her family, friends and congregation as well as her. Many churches organize events outside of worship where church members and their loved ones can come together as a community. Attend social gatherings with her; this way, you're taking steps to becoming part of one of the most important aspects of her life., While being supportive of her faith is a must, so is having time for yourselves. Find opportunities to cook meals together, go to the movies or just sit and talk. Her spiritual commitments are one thing, but your relationship should still be about the two of you.Plan regular date nights or clear some time to do the things you both like to do. Remember the other interests you discussed that initially attracted you to her and find more ways to make your connection stronger.  Make sure clear boundaries are in place concerning the ways you talk to and treat one another in regards to your beliefs. Once you've begun dating, you should both be working to ensure that the other feels comfortable and appreciated. This may sometimes be difficult if you don't share her religious beliefs. Knowing what is expected when you're together can make communication easier and prevent either person from feeling unfairly judged.Always be respectful. Religion can be a touchy subject, even between people who are close. Be aware of what is and isn't an acceptable way (as well as time and setting) to discuss your views. If you know a certain line of conversation might cause offense, you're probably better off avoiding it. Tactful communication is vital when it comes to talking about your closely-held convictions.  Consult one another on any potential changes in each person's life that might impact the relationship. It should be a cooperative affair every step of the way. If some facet of her beliefs or your own becomes an issue, discuss it coolly and reasonably and strive to reach a compromise you can both live with.It's possible that her religious beliefs might cause complications in dealing with matters like sex, careers, marriage and childbirth. If you've been open with one another about these things from the beginning, it will make talking them out easier. Every couple tackles difficult problems occasionally, and there should be no reason that your beliefs should drive a wedge between you if you care about each other.  Be the person that she needs you to be. Living in accordance with Christian values is about being kind, gentle, modest and giving. This is what she's looking for in a partner, and it's why she's chosen to spend time with you. As long as you're willing to be open and supportive of one another, your relationship should be a success. 

be up front about who you are.  find out what she likes to do.  find common ground.  know what her religion's position is on dating.  get a date.  encourage her to share her beliefs.  go to church with her.  make yourself part of her spiritual community.  take time to enjoy one another.  set boundaries.  make important decisions together.  meet one another's needs. 

 Ask, “Do you have some time to talk? Can we go somewhere private?” This may be a scary step that many people don’t want to take, but the best way to know how someone else feels is to get a straight answer from their mouth. You can find them and talk to them in-person, then and there, but it is probably best to negotiate a future time and place to meet. If you are nervous, use a non-invasive form of communication like a phone call, chat, or text to communicate your feelings.  Choose to talk in an easy going public place, like a cafe or a park. Your ex may be nervous about sharing their feelings with you and worried that they are unrequited. Make them as comfortable as possible by talking in a quiet and neutral location.   Give yourself and your ex plenty of time to have a long talk. Avoid having the talk when you have a major assignment due or if you have a meeting soon.  If you want to get your ex back, look your best during this talk. Wear your favorite outfit and style your hair nicely. You can use this time to both attract your ex and make yourself feel good, confident, and worthwhile.  The more honest you are about your feelings, the more inclined they are to be honest about theirs. Tell them your feelings. Be calm and clear. Maybe say “I still have romantic feelings for you,” or “I still care about you, as more than a friend.”   Tell them if you're regretting the breakup and want to get back together again. Provide specific reasons like “I miss you because we had so much fun together” or “I really enjoyed being together. You made me feel such peace.”  , You may have a lot of pent up emotions that you want to let out, but remember that they might, too. Allow them to tell you how they feel. This will allow you to know definitively whether or not they still care or want to get back together.If they expressly say they want to leave the situation, let them go. Don’t try to control them or force them to talk about things they don’t want to discuss.  If your ex still cares for you and you both decide to get back together, then move forward and create a stronger, more resilient relationship. Work out your previous issues to prevent them from cropping up again. However, if you determine that they no longer have feelings for you, this is okay, too. Move forward without them by learning to be alone, spending time with friends, and committing yourself to school or work. You can date again when you feel ready.  

be calm, clear, and casual.  choose a place where you will both be on comfortable, even ground.  be at your best.  tell your ex how you feel.  listen to their thoughts.  make peace with the outcome. 

 (The gel crystals are available at craft stores). Heat on "high" for three minutes to dry the crystals as much as possible.  The glass must be wide enough to accommodate the flower you're drying.  Cut enough so that only an inch (2.5cm) remains attached to the flower. Stick the stem into the crystals so that the blossom stands upright.  Keep pouring until the flower is completely covered.  Cook for 1 minute 45 seconds for rosebuds or up to 4 or 5 minutes for larger blossoms.  Gently pour off the crystals once cooled. Clean the flower petals carefully with a fine paintbrush, then mist lightly with an acrylic spray. The flowers can now be used for display or artwork.  

line a microwave-safe container with a bed of silica gel crystals.  pour an inch/2.5cm of warm crystals into a heavy glass.  snip the flower stem.  gradually pour the remaining warm crystals down the side of the glass.  microwave at "high".  cool the buds for 20 minutes. 

 Choose the area of ground from which you’ll be taking soil and cultivate the area. Remove any dead leaves, weeds, plant trimmings and other debris.Rake through the soil and smooth it out so that it is level.   Do not use areas that contain pesticides, chemicals or other pollutants. This can contaminate your soil.; , The water should reach approximately 12 inches deep into the soil. This will improve how well heat will conduct through the soil, heating it up and solarizing it thoroughly.  Seal in the soil under a plastic sheet; you can use a painter’s tarp, which is readily available at home supply stores. Place rocks or line soil along the edges of the sheet to hold them down.  There will be a good deal of heat generated and trapped under the plastic sheet, which will work to solarize the soil and kill unwanted pests, pathogens, and weeds. Summertime with hot and sunny weather is the ideal time to solarize soil.Leaving the tarp on longer than 4-6 weeks will result in a disintegrating tarp. You can rotate the areas of your garden that are being solarized , devoting a section of the garden to solarizing soil while another section has growing plants. Covering the ground like this in the colder months will actually create better conditions for weeds by warming the soil. Only do this during warmer months.  Fill glass or metal baking pans full of soil. Cover tightly with tin foil and bake at 200 °F (93 °C) for about 30 minutes. Stir the soil every 5 minutes as it bakes. Allow to cool completely.Your house will smell earthy when you use this method, which can be off-putting to some people.  Plant-based materials, including grass, straw, leaves, kitchen scraps, coffee grounds and weeds are great materials for a compost heap. Compost will ensure your homemade potting mix will have rich nutrients and beneficial microbes.  “Greens,” which produce nitrogen, include kitchen scraps, coffee grounds, weeds, grass trimmings and the like.Never put animal meats, dairy products, feces from dogs, cats or pigs, or biosolids (human waste) in your compost. This can make your compost a health hazard., This container can be purchased at a home supply store or made yourself. It should have a lid and be at least 3 feet cubed. This minimum size will ensure that the contents will be able to heat to 160 °F (71 °C) for at least 2 weeks. This will result in fully composted material.Be sure to turn over the composting material at least 5 times during these 2 weeks in order to ensure that the material is composting throughout. You can also add worms to your compost, which helps the composting process.  Once the material is fully composted, which usually takes about three months, push it through a screen in order to get particles of compost that are a consistent size. The particles should be relatively small so that you can mix it well into your potting mix. Return the larger particles to your compost bin., Sand will add air space in the potting mix, improving drainage in the dirt. Choose builder’s sand, which has a coarse texture. Do not use fine sand or plaster sand, as these are too fine and add a denser texture.Perlite is a good sand substitute. Made from volcanic rock, perlite is pH neutral and can improve how water drains from the soil. It is not as heavy as sand., Peat moss, or sphagnum moss, improves water retention in your potting mix. This can be especially helpful for plants that require more water over a sustained period of time.Peat moss is readily available at garden centers and does not cost much.   Peat moss does have high acidity, however, and may need to be counterbalanced to improve the pH balance in your soil. You can also use ground-up newspaper in place of peat moss, which will also help retain water.Coir fiber is another option to take the place of peat moss. Coir is the fiber from coconut husks and will improve water retention. It is usually sold at garden centers as a compressed brick that expands when moistened.Bark can also be used as a partial substitute for peat moss. It creates a lot of air space in the soil, although it does not retain water quite like peat.Some experts suggest avoiding bark, however, because it can immobilize nitrogen, a crucial component of good potting mix., Vermiculite is a volcanic rock material that is silvery gray in color. It is coarse, resembling mini pebbles, and it can improve water retention.Handle vermiculite gently to ensure that it does not lose its air holding capacity.Choose either a medium grade or coarse grade of vermiculite.  Good rich potting mix requires fertilizers and nutrients to give your plants food to help them grow strong, healthy and productive. Some of these materials might include blood meal (for nitrogen), bone meal (for phosphorus), greensand (for potassium), and other minerals. These are all readily available at garden centers.Limestone is another typical nutritional ingredient. Limestone is used to increase calcium or magnesium levels in the potting mix.Dolomitic limestone is best to get a combination of both calcium and magnesium in your soil. The exception to fertilizing would be if you want to use your potting mix to start seeds. Skip fertilizers for sensitive seedlings.  Gardening gloves will protect your hands from minor slivers, while a face mask will help prevent inhalation of dust and particles from the materials you’re working with.  Having all your tools and supplies on hand will speed up the process of making your own potting mix.You’ll need:    Large receptacle for mixing: This can be a large bucket, garbage can, wheelbarrow or other container.  Container for measuring: Some of the materials will be added in smaller amounts to the potting mix. It is helpful to have a container to measure accurately. A 5-gallon bucket is a useful size, as are 1-cup measuring cups.  Water: Have a watering can and hose available.  Trowel: A trowel will be useful for mixing your materials together.  Shovel: Have a shovel ready for shoveling larger amounts of soil, peat and compost into your mix.  Hardware cloth: Hardware cloth is a wire mesh screen that will be used to push your materials through to sift out the large pieces and debris. One-quarter inch hardware cloth is ideal.  It can be helpful to have a table for preparing the potting mix, especially if you’re making smaller batches in buckets. At the very least, you should have a level, open, work space that is outdoors. Put a tarp underneath your work space to catch extra dirt and other material.   Use a mixing barrel or large garbage can for mixing your potting mix.  There are a number of different recipes for potting mix, each of which is appropriate for different types of plants. For a general, all-purpose potting mix, use the following recipe:   Measure 1 part peat moss; 2 parts compost; 1 part vermiculite; 1 part sterilized garden soil; and 1 part perlite or sand. To start, use a 5-gallon bucket as each “part.”  , To remove large chunks and debris, run each of your ingredients through a screen or ¼ inch hardware cloth.Hardware cloth is wire mesh available in rolls from hardware and home supply stores for $5-$10 per roll.  Dump all the peat moss that you’re using into a mixing bin. It may help to start with a small batch of soil, instead of using all of your available materials in the first batch.  These will add nutrients to your potting mixture. A good fertilizing mixture is:For everyone 5 gallons of other ingredients, add 1 cup greensand; 1 cup blood meal; ½ cup bonemeal; ½ cup lime; and ½ cup rock phosphate.  Add each of these ingredients one by one and mix thoroughly. Turn over the soil to make sure you are mixing them all in throughout the potting mix., Store the unused potting mix in an old garbage can or other container with a lid. Choose a sheltered spot for storage. You don’t want your potting mix to be exposed to rain before it’s in your garden, so choose a spot that is under cover. Similarly, your potting mix should not be directly exposed to sun, especially in hot weather. A garden shed is a good storage place., The pH measures the acidity and alkaline levels of the soil.Meters that measure the soil’s pH levels are available for purchase online for $20 or more. Let the mixture mature for a week to give all the ingredients a chance to blend together before testing the pH. Place the pH meter in your soil to test its pH. If the soil is too high in either acid or alkaline, nutrients may not be absorbed into plants as easily.   An ideal pH level for most plants will be between 5.5 and 7.0To raise the pH levels, or to make it more alkaline, add some lime. To lower the pH, or to make it more acidic, add more sulphur.Make small batches of soil to test different mixtures and proportions. This will help you get a feel for how different ingredients produce different pH levels.  A bioassay is a test to check the viability of a biological specimen. Basically, this means that you’re going to use the soil to start seeds and monitor how they grow. Try growing oats, beans, or lettuce from seed. Monitor how quickly the seeds germinate and how the seedlings grow.If the majority of seeds do not germinate or the seedlings grow slowly, your potting mix might be poor. Try a different recipe for your potting mix. Search online for “potting mix recipe” to find another option. Remember to skip the fertilizer in your mix if you’re going to be using it to start seeds.  

rake through the soil.  water the soil thoroughly.  cover the soil with a clear plastic sheet.  let the soil area sit for 4-6 weeks.  alternately, sterilize the soil in your oven.  save kitchen scraps, grass clippings, and other compostable material.  mix 3 parts “browns” with 1 part “greens.” “browns” are materials that produce carbon, such as leaves, straw, and cornstalks.  put compostable material in a composting container.  process the compost through a screen.  purchase or acquire sand.  get peat moss.  get vermiculite.  assemble fertilizers and nutrients.  wear protective gear.  gather your supplies.  prepare your work space.  measure out your ingredients.  pour all ingredients separately through wire mesh hardware cloth.  put in the peat moss first into your mixing bin.  add fertilizers and mix thoroughly.  add compost, vermiculite and perlite.  store your potting mix.  test your soil with a ph meter.  test your soil with a bioassay. 

 If you want to adopt as a single woman, you need to find adoption agencies that are willing to adopt to single parents. Start your search with agencies near you, and make a list of several different agencies.Most adoption agencies have websites, so you can do much of this initial searching on the internet. You also can find tips and information on adoption community websites and online forums. Look for agencies that have information specifically about single-parent adoption. Just because an agency doesn't have a policy against single-parent adoption doesn't necessarily mean they encourage or support single-parent adoption.; , Many American mothers who've put their children up for adoption don't want them to go to single-parent homes. You'll typically have a lot better luck if you're interested in adopting a child from a developing country.If you want to adopt a baby, international adoption probably is your best bet as a single woman. Many American birth mothers putting infants up for adoption refuse to adopt to a single parent.  Before you decide which agency you want to use, take the time visit the agency and talk to the people who work there about your desire to adopt as a single woman. If staff seem critical or resistant, that probably isn't the right agency for you.Most agencies have a welcome meeting that you can attend. They'll go over the adoption process and answer any questions you have. Ask if they've successfully placed children with single mothers, and what their policy is regarding single-parent adoptions. You also may have the opportunity to talk to parents who have adopted children through that agency and learn more about their experiences.  When you start the process of adopting a child as a single woman, you may not fully understand the demands and challenges of single parenting. Take your decision seriously and read as much as you can about coping strategies and tips from other single parents.A caseworker interviewing you for an agency may ask you questions based on how you anticipate handling any of these challenges. Researching ensures you at least have a general idea how to respond and don't appear completely unprepared. You need to have a general idea of how you will handle various situations that might come up with your child. For example, if the school calls you and tells you that your child is sick, you need to know if you'll be free to leave work to pick up your child, or if you have a close friend or family member who could pick up your child for you.  You may face resistance from adoption agencies and others who are concerned that as a single parent, you will be unable to adequately meet the physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of a child on your own. It helps if you have a strong network of family and friends.For example, suppose your parents are retired and live near you. They may be willing to help take care of your child while you're at work. Close friends and neighbors also can help take care of your child and provide support when you need it. Talk to everyone close to you and find out what they would be willing to do to help.  You may be eligible for subsidies that can help cover some of your immediate adoption expenses. However, once the adoption is complete, you'll be on your own. Make sure you have the means to support a child for the next 10 to 20 years, depending on the age of the child you want to adopt.You don't have to be wealthy to adopt a child, but the more financially secure you are, the better your chances of being able to adopt as a single woman. If you're carrying a lot of debt, it may be a good idea to pay some of that down before you think about adopting a child. That way you'll be on more stable financial footing when you begin the adoption process.  If you have trouble finding an agency you like that will work with single parents, you might become a foster parent instead. Foster parents make a serious impact on a child's life, and you may have the opportunity to adopt a child you foster.Unlike adoption, you also are eligible to receive monthly payments to help financially support any foster children you care for. Fostering children also can be a good way to demonstrate that you are capable of handling a child on your own. A strong foster care record makes you a strong candidate for adoption.  State agencies, as well as a number of private agencies, typically have classes you must complete to learn about adoption and the needs of adoptive children.If you're adopting through a state agency, you may have to qualify as both a foster parent and an adoptive parent – even if you're not planning on fostering a child. When adopting through a private agency, you may have to pay a fee to attend parenting classes. During the training sessions, you'll go through the adoption application. If you have any questions about the process or any of the items on the application, ask a staff member for clarification.  You must provide thorough personal and financial information to adopt a child. You'll need to attach documentation to your application that supports the statements you made in the application itself.You'll have to verify your employment and income, and the adoption agency may contact your employer. You also must provide identification that proves you meet the minimum age for adoptive parents in your state. Ask your employer, family members, or other colleagues or community members to write reference letters for you to support your application to adopt.  Adoption agencies require you to submit an application, either in person or online, along with all required documents and letters of reference. Before you submit your application, double-check and make sure you have answered all questions honestly and completely.If you have any issues that you think might negatively impact the agency's decision, you might want to write a statement explaining the situation and how you've changed. For example, if you've ever been arrested or convicted of a crime, you want to address this up front on your application and discuss it openly.  Once your application is accepted by the agency, you'll be assigned a caseworker who will be your point person throughout the adoption process. They will describe to you the next steps of the process.You need to maintain a good relationship with your caseworker. They are on your side, and want to help you adopt a child. They can answer any questions you have, as well as give you tips and advice.  In most states, you must pass a criminal and employment background check before you will be finally approved to adopt. Typically you must request your criminal history from the FBI and the state law enforcement agencies of any states where you've lived.You also must show that you've never been listed on any child abuse, domestic violence, or sex offender registries. If you have friends or family members who either live in your home or will be frequent visitors, they also may be required to submit criminal histories.  Either your caseworker or another evaluator typically will conduct a home study to evaluate the home environment you plan to provide for the child you adopt.Since the home study is more in-depth than the application, you'll need additional documents that provide information about your home life and personal history. Pull any legal documents, such as diplomas, divorce decrees, or birth certificates, that relate to significant events in your life. You also may need to get a physical exam and submit a health report as part of your home study. Generally, they want to make sure you don't have any serious health problems that could negatively affect your ability to raise a child.  As part of your home study, your caseworker will interview both you and any friends or family members. They will visit and inspect your home and the space you have available for a child. The main purpose of the home study is to make sure you're adequately prepared to be a parent.Your caseworker should let you know if they find anything that might cause your application to be rejected, and give you advice on what to do with it. Through the home study, your caseworker is trying to help you get approved – not looking for reasons to reject you. If you went with a private agency, you typically must pay additional fees for the home study. These fees range anywhere from several hundred to several thousand dollars. Your caseworker will explain the fees and payment options available.  Once your home study is complete, your case worker will create a written report of your home study. Typically you'll have a meeting where they will go over the report with you and answer any questions you have.The home study report typically must be approved by someone else in the agency. They typically will follow your case worker's recommendation. If there are any aspects of your home study that your case worker thinks might cause you to be rejected as an adoptive parent, they will talk to you about those issues. There may be things you can do to eliminate or lessen those issues.  Provided you're approved as an adoptive parent after your home study is completed, your caseworker will start giving you information about children who are available for adoption.Your case worker will talk to you about your preferences for adoption, such as your age or gender preferences. They also will look at information about your lifestyle to help find the best possible matches for you. Talk to your case worker about activities you enjoy or other hobbies, particularly if you're thinking about adopting an older child. The case worker can be on the lookout for children who enjoy those activities as well.  

search for agencies.  expand your search internationally.  meet agency staff in person.  research single parenting.  evaluate your support system.  go over your finances.  look into foster care.  attend pre-service orientation and training.  get your documents together.  turn in your application.  meet with your caseworker.  complete all background checks.  gather information for your home study.  talk to your caseworker.  get a copy of your home study report.  learn about available children. 

 Hydrated land will feature one or more blue-colored blocks.; , A hoe will help prepare the land for farming. You can use a Diamond Hoe, Golden Hoe, Stone Hoe, Wooden Hoe, or Iron Hoe.   Craft a hoe using two sticks, and two pieces of materials, such as cobblestone, wooden planks, diamonds, or iron or gold ingots., The block will become highlighted.  This will help prepare the area for farming wheat. The instructions for hoeing your land vary depending on your gaming console. After your land is hoed, the land will turn brown.   PC: Right-click on the block of land. PE: Tap on the block of land. Xbox 360 / Xbox One: Press the left trigger (LT) button. PS3 / PS4: Press the L2 button.  The wheat seeds must be planted into the fresh soil.   Navigate to any long, tall grass located near your farmland. Tall grass can be broken and collected to make wheat. Left-click on the tall grass, then walk over the seeds. The grass will be broken, and the wheat seeds will automatically be added to your personal inventory., The instructions for planting seeds are identical to those for hoeing land as outlined in step #4. After planting the wheat seeds, your wheat will start to grow automatically. The wheat cannot be harvested until the plants have grown to their full size.  This process can take minutes, hours, or days depending on your Minecraft gaming progress. After your wheat crops are fully grown, you can harvest the wheat and add the food to your inventory. Alternately, the growth rate of wheat can be accelerated using bone meal fertilizer, which can be crafted from a single bone.   Verify that your character owns bone meal. Bone meal can be crafted in a 3x3 crafting grid by placing a Bone into the very center square of the grid.Select the bone meal from your hotbar, then sprinkle it over your wheat crops. The instructions for using bone meal are identical to those for hoeing land as outlined in step #4. When complete, your wheat crops will now be fully grown and ready for harvesting.  The instructions for harvesting wheat vary depending on your gaming console. After your wheat is harvested, the wheat will float above the ground.   PC: Point to the wheat, then left-click and hold the mouse button. PE: Tap and hold the wheat. Xbox 360 / Xbox One: Point to the wheat and press the right trigger (RT) button. PS3 / PS4: Point to the wheat and press the R2 button.  This will add the wheat to the hotbar in your personal inventory.Don’t delay in picking up the wheat, since the wheat will disappear shortly after it’s been harvested.  

navigate to an area of hydrated land that features water.  verify that your character owns a hoe.  select your hoe from the hotbar, then position your cursor over a block located right next to the water.  use your hoe to expose the soil on your block of land.  verify that your character owns wheat seeds.  select your wheat seeds from the hotbar, then plant them into your soil.  wait for the wheat to grow to its full size.  harvest your wheat by breaking the wheat plant to access the wheat inside your crops.  walk over the wheat within a few seconds after it falls to the ground. 

 This may include suddenly missing more work than usual, losing interest in a career or failing grades in school subjects that would normally not be challenging to the person at all.While missing work or school can be a sign of drug use, sometimes spending too much time working can also be a sign there is drug use occurring. It is not unusual for some adults to start using drugs as a way to add more awake time to the day, so suddenly working nearly non-stop can point to a substance problem. Friends at school or work may also change if there is a new drug problem. Your loved one may no longer want to see anyone socially due to fear of being caught. Or, they may have made new friends who share the same habit. If it is a change for your loved one to skip happy hour with co-workers not once but every week , this may mean there is something to hide.; , Sudden changes in spending or missing money can be a sign of a problem they are trying to hide. Even small changes like not being quite as open as they have been in the past about money can mean there is something to hide like a drug or alcohol issue.Changes in money habits can also include a sudden use of credit cards or obtaining new lines of credit when that was not something they did in the past. Overdue bills are another sign that money is being spent on things that are out of the ordinary as well.  Significant changes in both the physical body as well as mannerism may be a sign of drug use. Take a closer look at your loved one’s appearance. Is something different?Examples of physical changes may include losing weight, facial signs indicating lack of sleep, poor hygiene, and other changes like not keeping hair cut for work or being clean-shaven. Depending on the drug of choice, they may also suddenly seem like they have endless energy and more movement due to “nervous energy”. Beyond the physical body, you may also start to notice the same clothes being worn for a longer amount of time than usual. If the drug use includes the use of needles, you may also notice that they often wear long-sleeved clothing year round to hide the arms.  Things disappearing at home may be a sign that property is being sold or traded for drugs, especially if the person has built up a tolerance to drugs. They may need more and more money to fund the drug use. This may include electronics or other items that are easily sold coming up missing.   Other signs of a problem may include family members noticing prescription drugs coming up missing like pain killers, attention meds or a variety of other drugs.Major changes in sleep patterns including either not sleeping for days on end or the reverse can mean drugs are in play. Certain drugs can cause one to stay awake for several days at a time and then cause a crash that sends one into days of sleeping.  The previous steps can help you identify general changes in behavior, mood, and appearance that may point to a loved one using drugs. In addition, it is also wise to be knowledgeable about the effects of using specific drugs. For example, use of these drugs may result in the following signs and symptoms:Marijuana: increased appetite, euphoria, dry mouth, memory impairment, and paranoiaCocaine: increased agitation, hyperactivity, cold symptoms, and lowered inhibitionsEcstasy: lowered inhibitions, heightened sexuality, increased energy, tightness in mouth/jaw, increased heart rate, and muscle tensionMeth: increased body temperature, jaw clenching, insomnia, loss of appetite, sweating, and paranoia 

pay attention to problems happening at school or work.  consider your loved one’s money habits.  look at their physical appearance.  watch for the signs of drug addiction.  be aware of how different drugs affect behavior. 

 As you walk out of the airport you will find many trusted taxi services and shuttles to take you anywhere you wish.; , Plan on spending between $25-35 American dollars to get you to Antigua depending on how many passengers there are. You will find many travel services branching out of Antigua to take you anywhere in the country.  You will be able to find hostels as low as $8 per person a night to 5 star hotels that will easily run you $300 per room a night. You´re bound to find something in your budget range and you'll enjoy Antigua regardless of where you stay. La Antigua is a walking town so your won't need much money for transportation once you get there. If you ever get caught in the rain and want a quick ride back to your hotel just catch a tuk tuk for 10 Quetzales which is around $1.25 and can take you anywhere within the city limits. There is a lot to do in Antigua so don't waste a minute! It's a good idea in the beginning to just take a walk, you will be able to find a map in most any shop. Take time to sit in the park, get your shoes shined by a local shoe shine boy, buy a few scarves and necklaces from the Mayan girls and breathe in the fresh mountain air. Don't forget to tour the ruins. The main ones being San Francisco, La Merced, Las Capuchines, the Main Cathedral by Central Park and don't miss Santo Domingo!  , There's nothing stateside quite like it! If you buy any of the fruits or vegetables make sure to wash them really well and dry them before consumption. For all the coffee lovers out there, there are several local coffee farms just waiting for you to take a tour and enjoy a freshly roasted cup of goodness.  It shouldn't cost you any more than $20 round trip per person. Plan to stay at least 3 days here as well to really enjoy it! Lake Atitlan is a must see! All the natural beauty is to say the least, breathtaking! There's no other place quite like it. If you start your journey in Panajachel, I recommend taking a boat taxi 25Q which is around $3 to San Tiago and from there taking a tuk tuk to Posada de San Tiago. It's located beautiful on the lake and the service is wonderful. For a couple, expect to pay $40-90 a night depending on what you want. If you have a group of 10 or more you can stay for $15 a night per person. Make sure to reserve ahead of time! Once settled spend your first afternoon nestled by the pool which overlooks the lake. There is also an outdoor hot-tub & sauna to be enjoyed. Take out a canoe, go around the bend and see the Mayan women washing their clothes and children in the lake. The next day, take a boat tour around all the surrounding villages. Each village has something different to offer. If you plan on buying a painting while in Guatemala, this is the place to do it as the prices are unbeatable!  , It's a 10 hour drive or 45 min. plane ride. You can book a trip/tour with most any of the travel agencies in Antigua. A private tour is best so that you can spend time doing what you're really interested in. I would set aside at least 3 or 4 days to truly enjoy this majestic piece of history.  Usually you can better deals if you do multiple trips with the same agency. Have a great trip!  

plan on flying into la aurora international airport in guatemala city, guatemala.  start your trip in the colonial town of la antigua, guatemala which is only 45 minutes from the capital.  spend a minimum of 3 days in antigua to make the most of your trip.  check out the local farmers market.  go to one of the many travel agencies and book a shuttle ride to lake atitlan.  if you haven't felt like you've had enough adventure yet and still have plenty of money to spend take a trip to the ancient mayan pyramids of tikal and el mirador.  once you've found an agency you like, continue to use them to get a ride back to the airport.

 The best smartphone review will result from drawing on your extensive personal experiences with the basics of the device. Without understanding these thoroughly, your review won't be able to enlighten potential buyers, so be sure to be thoroughly comfortable with the basics.   If you don't already own the smartphone in question (for example, if you're reviewing a range of phones for your blog), visit one of the smartphone carrier's retail store and play around with the phone, or ask a friend who owns the device if you can use it for a day. Learn about the phone's features, design, pros, cons, and the price.; , Start with the facts. Be sure to provide the smartphone's name, and any nicknames that it might have acquired in the market as consumers use it. Some consumers will only refer to nicknames when searching, so cover all bases. Give a basic rundown of its cost, availability, network coverage, plans, etc. as relate to your region (noting that it is also important to point out where you're reviewing from and the mobile carrier you're using, given that the internet is worldwide). It's also really helpful to introduce the review with the reason why you have chosen to review it.   Be sure to include any relevant hyperlinks to help customers find the information you're referring to, perhaps even purchase locations.  At this point, you can give your opinion about the phone's particular features. Outline or detail the features in different categories, such calling, text messaging, camera, MP3 abilities, navigation, web browsing, etc. This way, your review will be more thorough without being too confusing. It's a good idea to headline each category and to write succinct explanations for each part of the phone; a potential buyer won't linger too long for the advice.   Talk about what you like about the smartphone you're reviewing, how easy it is to use, what features in particular are of worthy note.  Readers of your review will be more pleased with an honest, fair opinion of a popular smartphone than a highly biased or positive review of a particular device. Plus, it's a lot more trustworthy if your review is balanced. In addition, it can be really helpful for future designs of the phone and for customers to know the ways in which you think the phone could be improved. This helps to give customers a heads up on weaknesses that they can choose to manage around or perhaps prefer a different phone instead.   Look at the advertising blurb accompanying the smartphone. Consider whether you think the smartphone in question lives up to the hype or whether there are aspects that you don't agree with. It will be important to compare your experience with the advertised promises. Even summarizing the review with the best "pro" and the most annoying or disabling "con" can be a good overall summary for readers. For example, "Pros: This smartphone has a battery that outlasts any of its competitors in the same niche. Cons: Its price and the limited color range."  , Be sure to include photos detailing all of the features described. If you are recording a video review, try filming with a high-definition camcorder for optimum viewing because the clearer it is, the better.  At this stage, it is helpful to conclude by giving your overall impression of the smartphone and your experience of using it, along with encouragement to try it. It helps to clarify if you think the smartphone will only be of use to some people (such as a business person or a teenager, etc.), or whether you think the phone is ideal for anyone; once again, that sort of conclusion is up to your opinion of its utility.   Post your review on a blog, on a review site, or anywhere else relevant and be sure to respond to comments made to you. Sometimes developers will also respond if your review has struck a chord, so it pays to monitor your review actively for a good period of time.  

increase your background knowledge of the device you'll be reviewing.  introduce the smartphone.  break down your review into categories.  always include the phone's drawbacks along with its better features.  take clear, detailed photos of the device for written reviews.  reach a conclusion. 

 Especially if you’re a recent high-school or college graduate, unemployed, or have just started a new job, claiming you’re too cash-strapped to participate is a valid excuse. Being a bridesmaid is expensive! On average, a bridesmaid will spend at least $1,500 by the time the bride says “I do.”You can’t afford to purchase the dress. Bridesmaid’s dresses are not cheap and if the bride chooses especially high-end couture you may not even be able to afford the fabric. Bridesmaids typically pay $50 to $250-plus for their dresses.You can’t afford to join in on the bachelorette fun. If you suspect your friend's sendoff will be elaborate, be honest with her. "Jenny, you will always remember your bachelorette party and you deserve one that's truly epic. I simply can't afford to pay hundreds of dollars on airfare, hotel, dining out, etc. I know how incredibly thoughtful you are, and I don't want you to be tempted skimp on the fun to accommodate my finances." Be prepared in case she offers to pay your way. The bride-to-be might offer to subsidize your bridesmaid expenses so you can participate. If you truly don’t want to be a bridesmaid, have a reply ready in case she offers. “You are such an amazing friend to offer to pay my way. I am so touched, but I would feel guilty accepting your incredibly generous offer. After your wedding, once I’m back on my feet financially, let’s plan a girl’s trip!”; , Even if you have a good job (and the bride-to-be knows it), you may not want to spend your income on bridesmaid duties. There are valid reasons why you may not want to allocate your disposable income to bridesmaid expenses:   You are trying to pay off your student loans. Your car is on its last legs and you need to buy a new one soon. You are saving up the down payment to buy a home. You, your child, or your pet needs to have an expensive medical procedure performed in the near future.  Tell the bride-to-be that your husband is the breadwinner, and he’s stingy. If you’re married and your husband makes the money, he has a say in how it’s spent. He may not actually care if you spend money on bridesmaid duties, but he’ll probably be fine playing along with your ruse because it will save both of you money. You could say, “Jim has been feeling stressed out at work and he’s worried his job may be in jeopardy. He has been strongly encouraging me to save money right now.”  

tell the bride you are struggling financially.  explain to the bride that your disposable income is spoken for.  blame your spouse! 

 In a job interview, ethical questions are used to determine if you can be a responsible and sustainable employees. As an employee, you also want to feel like you are working for an ethical employer. So when you are asked ethical questions during your interview, this is a good sign that your employer cares about your morals and values as an employee.In an interview for medical school, you will likely be asked ethical questions as a way to determine if you have sound ethical decision making. This is an essential element of being a good and responsible physician, especially in situations of life and death.; , Before you head to your job interview, you should prepare for ethical interview questions by reviewing several common questions used by potential employers, including:What would you do if someone in management asked you to do something unethical? Tell me about a time you faced an ethical dilemma. If you saw a coworker doing something dishonest, what would you do? If you knew that your supervisor was doing something unethical, what would you do?  , The process for getting into medical school usually involves an in person interview, where you will be asked several ethically based questions, including:You observe a fellow medical student cheating on an examination. What would you do? How would you tell a patient just diagnosed with cancer that he has only a few weeks to live? Would you get out of your car to help a victim after observing an accident? What are your thoughts on euthanasia? A pregnant 15-year-old unmarried teenager comes into your office asking for an abortion. What would you do? Would you inform her parents?  , One of the golden rules of answering ethical questions in a medical school interview is to always focus on how you can put your patient’s needs first. You should place the patient’s welfare above all else, as your role as a physician is to serve your patients, first and foremost.  For example, to answer the ethical question in a medical school interview: What are your thoughts on euthanasia?, you may consider how you can put the needs of a patient on life support first. If the patient is suffering unduly and there is no medical way to save her life, you may advocate for the use of euthanasia, as this will be in the best interests of the patient. As well, if the patient specified that she wanted to be euthanized once her health deteriorated to a certain point, you have an ethical obligation to fulfill her wishes, especially when there is nothing more you can do to save her life as her physician.  When answering ethical questions in a job interview, you should try to put the needs of your employer first, where you are not putting your employer at risk in any way.To answer the ethical question in a job interview: If you saw a coworker doing something dishonest, what would you do?, you may consider how the coworker’s actions puts your employer at risk. You may then respond by noting that the coworker is putting himself, the company, and other employees at risk, as his actions affect the ethics of everyone around him. As a result, you would confront him about his dishonesty and report him to your supervisor so he is held accountable for his actions.  The interviewers are asking you ethical questions to test your ability to act with integrity and honesty. Your responses should reflect the importance of these attributes in your decision making and how much you value them.For example, if you are answering the question: If you knew that your supervisor was doing something unethical, what would you do?, you may think about how the supervisor’s actions conflict with your ability to act with integrity and honesty. You may respond by noting that the supervisor was not acting with integrity or honesty, which is very important to you. To resolve the situation, you would confront your supervisor and report her to her supervisor or to the Human Resources department. This will ensure that your workplace remains honest and ethical. If you are answering the question:You observe a fellow medical student cheating on an examination. What would you do?, you may note that your peer’s actions do not reflect your values of integrity and honesty. To resolve the situation, you would confront your peer and report her to the medical school. This will ensure the examination remains honest and ethical, and that you can act as an honest person moving forward in the examination process.  Often, using examples to support your response to an ethical question can show the interviewer how you can put your ethics into action in a specific situation. You should prepare one to two strong examples that explore an ethical dilemma and your response to it.For example, you may receive a more open ended question such as: Tell me about a time you faced an ethical dilemma. You can respond by using a situation where you discovered a colleague was cutting corners on a group project, leading to nearly missing the client deadline. You may note that you waited for the project to be handed in and then confronted your colleague by expressing your disappointment and frustration with their unethical handling of the project. You may then suggest that your colleague speak to your supervisor to discuss how and why he cut corners, as this could put you, the team, and the company in jeopardy. If your colleague refuses to do this, you may decide to talk to your supervisor yourself. This response shows that you are trying to stay true to your ethics and show your colleague the courtesy of speaking to her one on one. By giving her the option to speak to your supervisor herself, you are extending trust to your colleague. It also shows you are willing to try to work out the issue among you and your colleague first, before going to your supervisor.  It can be helpful to write down your response on a piece of paper or on your computer and then read it out loud to yourself to ensure it flows and makes sense. This will allow you to better prepare for the actual interview, as you will have a lower risk of babbling and long winded responses if you write down your thoughts first.   You can recite your response to yourself in front of a mirror so you can gauge your body language and your eye contact. You should have relaxed body language with your arms at your sides and your body facing forward. You should also maintain eye contact, and display happy facial expressions, like smiling or laughing.  You can practice your responses to ethical questions by having a friend pretend to be your interviewer. Have a friend or peer ask you a series of ethical questions to determine how well you can respond to each question naturally, but concisely.   You should try to respond to the questions from memory, so you may need to memorize some of your written answers. You should also be willing to get feedback on your responses from your friend or peer and adjust your responses based on their feedback.  

be aware of the purpose of ethical questions in an interview.  read sample ethical questions for a job interview.  review sample ethical questions for an interview for medical school.  focus on putting the best interests of the patient first in a medical interview.  try to put the employer's best interests first in a job interview.  emphasize the importance of acting with integrity and honesty.  lean on examples in your own experiences to support your response.  write down your response and then recite it out loud.  practice responding to the questions with a friend or peer. 

 It's easier to see the dust and dirt when the monitor is off, and safer for you and your computer.          Make sure that you let the screen cool down before you start if you're cleaning a plasma TV. If you try to clean the monitor while the pixels are firing you may end up damaging the screen. While the risk is small, there is the possibility of an electric shock if you clean the monitor while it’s on.; , Spray windex or another gentle cleaning solution onto a clean cloth and use it to wipe the casing around the screen (MAKE SURE TO NOT GET ANY OF IT ON THE PANEL ITSELF, as that will ruin the anti-glare coating).          The casing is made with durable plastic, so it's fine to scrub a little if you need to remove bits of grime. Don't spray the cleaner directly onto the casing, since you might accidentally get some on the screen, and some of it might drip into crevices and get inside, ruining your monitor. Clean the monitor's base, the buttons, and the back of the monitor. Wrap a corner of the cloth around your finger or a toothpick to clean out the hard-to-reach crevices. If your monitor has any cords attaching it to the CPU or power, unplug these and give them a good cleaning too.  Microfiber cloth is ideal. This type of anti-static cloth doesn't leave a lint residue on the screen, and it's soft enough that it won't scratch the surface. Wipe off any visible dust, dirt and grime with the cloth.          Don't use towels, paper products or other scratchy cloth to wipe the screen. These will leave lint and may cause scratches. Disposable dusting cloths, such as Swiffer cloths also work well. Don't press hard on the screen or try to scrub it. You might damage it and cause discoloration to occur next time you turn it on. If your screen is very dirty, rinse or change the cloth in-between passes. Clean gently and gradually.  These can easily damage your screen, especially if it has a matte, anti-glare finish.   If necessary, use distilled water. No tap water since it can leave mineral deposits on the screen. Make sure that your microfiber cloth is just barely damp. Consider buying a specifically formulated screen cleaning fluid. Read reviews and check your users manual to make sure which are safe for your particular monitor. For a mild homemade cleaner, mix water and white vinegar in equal proportions. Use this to dampen (not wet) your cleaning cloth.Always apply any liquid to the cloth, not directly to the screen, to prevent dripping (if even one drip reaches the bezel, it will immediately ruin your monitor). Don’t use anything soapy that can leave a residue.  These are convenient and specifically designed for monitors.          Make sure they are gentle enough for anti-glare screens, if you have one. Read reviews online or ask a salesperson to find a good brand.  Remember to avoid using circular motions as that might create buffed out spots.          Don't rub or scrub too hard. Be patient; it might take a few moments for the solution to soak into the spot enough to adequately remove it. To help the solution soak in, hold the dampened cloth over the spot for a little while. Avoid the temptation to spray the solution directly onto the screen if the spot is stubborn. When the spot has been removed, wipe the area dry with a clean part of the cloth.  This prevents any moisture that may have gotten into your monitor from causing damage, or electrical shock.  If your monitor has a scratch, you may be able to get it replaced.   Check the warranty that came with your monitor to find out what your options are. Once you start trying to repair the scratch yourself, further damage may no longer be covered by your warranty.  Computer stores and computer sections of department stores sell scratch repair kits for LCD monitors.          Check online reviews to find out the best formulation for your particular scratch. Follow the instructions for applying the scratch solution to your screen.  Use a cotton swab to apply a thin layer of jelly over the scratch.          If the scratch is small, a bit of petroleum jelly is a safe option. It won't repair the scratch, but it will make it look more discreet.  Make sure it is not the gel-type, as this will not work.         Work the toothpaste over the scratch with a microfiber or other soft cloth. Let it dry, then wipe off with a clean, barely damp cloth.  A paste of baking soda and water may also be used to remove small scratches.         Mix two parts baking soda with one part water. Add more baking soda if needed to make a thick paste. Work the paste over the scratch with a microfiber or other soft cloth. Let it dry, then wipe off with a clean, barely damp cloth.  Rubbing compound can be found online or at auto supply stores.          Be very careful when using this. Limit it to the damaged area only, and consider doing a spot test on the corner of your screen. Rub a very small amount on your screen with a q-tip, and work back and forth until the scratch is minimized. Let it sit for a few minutes, then wipe off carefully. Clean the screen very well afterwards with a clean cloth and screen cleaning fluid or dilute vinegar.  Consider this option for very old monitors, or where the scratch might get bigger if not addressed. This will cause a bit of haziness on the screen where the lacquer was applied.Cut a hole in a piece of paper. The hole should be slightly larger than the scratch. Use this to mask off the screen. and make sure everything is covered (keyboard, buttons, etc) except the scratch. Spray a thin coat of lacquer onto the paper, over the hole, to “stencil” the lacquer onto the scratch. Remove the paper carefully afterwards, to avoid smearing. Alternately, clear nail polish applied to the scratch may also prevent it from becoming larger. Use a small brush or toothpick to carefully apply the lacquer to the scratch. Clear lacquer may be found in craft stores and places where spray paint is sold. Make sure the lacquer is completely dry before you turn on your screen. Always use lacquer in a well-ventilated area. Make sure your screen is completely clean before applying lacquer.    For glare-reducing screens, this can create a “shiny spot” on the screen. Consider the risk of these options as trade-offs, rather than having an annoying scratch. Remember to use your best judgement and apply these methods conservatively.  It’s a small price to pay for a scratch-free screen!  

turn off and unplug the monitor.  clean the frame.  wipe the monitor with a clean, soft piece of fabric.  do not use ammonia, alcohol or acetone-based products.  consider using screen wipes.  for stubborn stains, gently wipe the spot on the screen moving in as broad a motion as you can either left to right or up and down across the screen.  make sure everything is dry before turning on your monitor.  check your warranty.  buy a scratch repair kit.  try petroleum jelly for a temporary fix.  use a bit of toothpaste to buff out the scratch.  use baking soda to buff out the scratch.  try rubbing compound for severe scratches.  use clear lacquer.  know that these methods are to be used at your own risk, and may damage your screen.  consider investing in a screen protector to prevent future scratches. 

 In Minecraft, slime blocks have a slight "bouncy" effect when you jump on them. On top of this, you don't receive any falling damage from landing on them — no matter how high you fall from.This makes them perfect for making a trampoline! Since you'll want to make a trampoline that's big enough to hit when you're falling from a great height, you'll probably want at least nine before you get started.   Slime blocks are crafted from nine slimeballs at the crafting table.You can get slimeballs by killing slime mobs, which tend to appear underground and in swamps.; , Make a square or circle with the slime blocks. Keep it one layer thick — multiple layers won't change the properties of the trampoline. This will be the "bouncy" surface of the trampoline that you'll jump on to.   If you wish, you can just put this pad on the floor. However, if you're going for a realistic-looking trampoline, you may want to make a frame of wood, stone, or metal a few blocks off of the floor. Putting a ladder on one side is a nice touch.  Use whatever spare blocks you have to build your skinny tower — stone and wood work fine. There's no "right" height, but the higher you jump from, the more you'll bounce.   Unless you want to build a system of stairs, a ladder will be a huge help for getting to the top again once you jump. Craft ladders by arranging seven wood sticks in an "H" shape at a crafting table., You should bounce several times before gradually coming to a rest. Now, just climb up and try again!  

gather at least nine slime blocks.  arrange the slime blocks in a wide, flat pad.  build a tower next to your trampoline to jump off.  jump onto the slime blocks. 

 It has to be an interesting name so that people will want to play it. The name should be catchy and original, so people will want to play your game. (Don't use other card game names, like Yu-Gi-Oh! or Pokémon); , Science fiction, space, fantasy, western, past, future, are a few examples.  You should base the rules on the background and story, not the other way around. So this step must come before the rules  , Make a good set of rules and an exciting objective. The rules have to be balanced its not too easy its not too complicated. It's no fun playing a card game when there are no rules or too many rules to follow.   Many games have different rules. Some are strict whereas others can be looser. Experiment, and see what is right for you. When planning the game, you must come up with a good playing field. You might as well think of how turns will be lost or gained, how to win the game, and more.  There definitely must be a very wide assortment of characters. Power-ups, bonuses and health are also several cards that can make a card game more interesting. You can also make "rule-bending" cards that change the rules.   This makes your card game more interesting. These cards may be grouped into types, elements, or classes if the creator desires. These cards must have graphics. Few people would like to play a card game by just looking at words on a card. Hire an artist if you need.  It would have been a bit confusing if the creator of Yu-Gi-Oh! called his game "A Time in Modern Rome" for a time period. If your game has many different creatures from different time periods, this step is irrelevant.  Photoshop is a recommended choice. Draw out your templates on the program, then write on the card the abilities, colour, attack power, name etc... You may also draw the cards by hand, but this is extremely time consuming. , 

plan out the name of your trading card game.  come up with a basic genre for your game.  come up with a unique background and story.  plan the game.  think of various types of cards.  come up with a good and relevant time period.  get a program such as ms paint and a tablet.  either print out the templates on card or paper, then get your artist to draw on them, or use a tablet to draw them on your computer.  ,  play it with your friends and have fun!  

 There are several different ways to copy files using the Windows Command Prompt. All the commands can copy files from one place to another, but there are several cases where you may want to choose one command over the others.    COPY - This is the basic copy function. It will allow you to quickly copy files from one location to another. You can also use this command to concatenate files.  XCOPY - The xcopy command allows you to copy files and directory trees. This makes it much more suitable for copying folders. xcopy also has many modifiers which gives advanced users more control over the copying process. xcopy has been deprecated in favor of robocopy, but still works.  ROBOCOPY - This is the newest copy command available in the Windows Command Prompt. It requires Windows Vista or later. Windows XP users can install the Windows 2003 Server Resource Kit Tools pack to use it. robocopy is designed to mirror files and directories while maintaining permissions and other attributes. It also allows for better logging and more reliable copying of large amounts of data.  

know which command to use. 

 Dry shampoo can clean and moisturize your scalp when applied before you go out. It can be found in drugstores or online and comes in spray and powder form. To apply, spray your hair a few times or sprinkle a little on top of your scalp. Comb in the spray or powder, which will help comb out any dandruff flakes. Rinse your comb after each stroke.Talcum powder can be used instead, but it can make dark or black hair look grey, white, or dotted.; , Find the region of your scalp with the most dandruff, and comb your hair so it covers this area. Hairstyling products may help you achieve this task, but fluffing up your hair into a tousled look can work as a quick improvement.Covering up the dandruff is not actually treating anything, and you should keep in mind that this is only a quick visual fix. The best way to get rid of dandruff is to actually use treatment methods that will affect the underlying causes.  Select a shirt, dress, or other top with a white, grey, or metallic appearance. This will make white or yellow dandruff flakes much less noticeable.Textured or patterned clothing may help hide the dandruff as well.  Any cap, hat, or scarf can be used to hide the dandruff on your scalp. As long as it's on, it will also minimize the number of dandruff flakes that fall onto your clothing. Plus, people will not be able to see any flakes that are stuck to your hair.  Pocket a mini-lint roller before you head outside. Any time you see dandruff flakes on your clothing, make a trip to the bathroom and use the lint roller to pick them up off the fabric.   If you can't get your back, have a friend or loved one help you. 

comb it out with dry shampoo.  cover the worst areas with your hairstyle.  wear light colors.  wear a hat or scarf.  carry a lint roller. 

 A shiny black PVC jumpsuit is the basis of of many a Catwoman costume, and Michelle Pfeiffer's look is no different. Try to get a jumpsuit that zips up the front, with a high neckline and long sleeves. These type of jumpsuits are readily available at most costume or Halloween stores, or can be found online and purchased off eBay.   If you don't have the time or money to buy a PVC jumpsuit, you can piece together a similar look using items already in your wardrobe. Tight leather pants, leather or wet look leggings, or even a tight pair of black jeans can be used for the pants. A tight black turtleneck sweater will form the top.; , Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman jumpsuit had white stitching detail all over, so that's the look your are trying to recreate. First grab some white chalk and draw the outline of the jagged lines you want to create.   Place them at random all over the the PVC suit (or top and trousers), using a picture of the Catwoman costume from the movie for reference. Then take a needle and length of white thread and start stitching over the white lines. If you're tight for time, you can simply use the white chalk to create the stitched effect, or paint over the chalk with some white-out.  Possibly the most important part of Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman costume was her headpiece -- a black PVC half-mask with cat ears. In order to achieve an authentic-looking headpiece, it may be best to buy a replica mask off Amazon or eBay. These sites often sets which include a headpieces, gloves and claws. However, if you are on a budget, you can make your own Catwoman headpiece at home. Here's how:   Take an old pair of black cotton sweatpants. Make sure that there is some stretch in the material and that you can fit the leg of the pants over your head. Cut off the bottom of the sweatpants -- the piece you cut off should be long enough to cover half your face, reaching just above the tip of your nose. There should also be several inches of material above the top of your head, to make the ears. Take a piece of white chalk and draw a white semi-circle on the cut side of the material. This is the line you will cut out to form pointy ears on both sides of the mask. Also draw two large eyes on the mask, using a picture from the movie for reference. Take a sharp scissors and cut out the semi-circle along the chalk line. Also cut out the two eye holes. Take a needle and some black thread and sew the top of the mask closed - there should now be pointy ears on top of the head. Try the mask on -- if it feels too loose along the sides, add a couple of stitches to tighten it.You can wear the mask as it is, or you can add the same white jagged stitching you did on the jumpsuit. Again, use a picture of Michelle Pfeiffer's headpiece from the movie as reference.  To achieve Catwoman-worthy talons, all you need to do is find a pair of elbow-length, black gloves - if you can find them in a shiny material, that's great, otherwise any kind of material will do. Take a sharp scissors and cut slits in the tip of each finger.   Find a packet of black fake nails - the longer and pointier the better. Apply them to your own fingernails, then slip on the gloves - the pointy ends of the fake nails should poke right through the slits. Tah-dah! Of course it is also possible to buy Catwoman gloves online with the nails already attached - but this method gives you the option of taking the gloves off and still having cat-like claws!  , To complete the look, you will need some knee-high black boots with a killer heel. Give them a good polish before you wear - Catwoman wouldn't dare leave the house in scuffed shoes!  , Halle Berry's Catwoman sported a slightly different look to her other incarnations, so no need for a jumpsuit this time. For the pants you will need leather or wet-look pants -- you should be able to find a suitable pair at a Halloween or costume store.   Although the pants should be tight at the top, the legs should widen slightly at the bottom -- in the movie, Halle Berry's pants are bootcut rather than skinny. Take some white chalk and draw jagged lightening bolt shapes all over the legs of the pants -- front and back. Then take a sharp scissors and cut along the lines to a achieve a ripped effect. Don't worry about cutting neatly -- you want to look as though you were attacked by a horde of angry cats!  , You need to be prepared to flash some flesh with this costume! If possible, find a PVC or leather-look bra or cropped bustier to mimic Halle Berry's hardcore lingerie from the movie. If you can't find anything suitable in those materials, silk is your next best option.   And hey, if you have time before you actually need to wear the costume, why not work on achieving a flat stomach -- the best accessory this costume could have! If you are not comfortable revealing that much flesh, or you plan on being outdoors, a good alternative is to wear a black, strappy bodysuit instead. Just make sure you put some rips and tears in it as well, to achieve the claw-ravaged look!  , Halle Berry's wore a complicated, criss-crossed belt contraption that connected her bra straps to her pants. An exact replica of this would be hard to achieve, but you can create a similar effect simply by wrapping two belts around your waist, crossing them over to form an "X" shape. Ideally the belts would be made from canvas, in black or dark khaki green, but any kind of belts will do the job.  Like Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman, Halle Berry's interpretation of the feline anti-heroine includes a black half-mask with cat ear detail. This Catwoman is matte black, without any white-stitching detail. You best bet is probably to buy an exact replica online, however you can also make your own mask using the method outlined in Step 3 of the previous section.  If you want to stay really true to the movie, you should wear some open-toed black shoes or boots, with an average-sized heel. However, any kind of shoes or boots will do, as long as the legs of the pants are worn over them, rather than tucked in.  The finishing touches to this Catwoman look are a pair of black leather gloves -- over the elbow, if possible --- and a black leather whip You can find costume whips in Halloween stores or online, or you can do a makeshift version by painting a jump rope black.  The most recent incarnation of Catwoman was portrayed by Anne Hathaway in The Dark Knight Rises. This is perhaps the simplest version of the Catwoman costumes, but that doesn't diminish it's sexiness!   The basis of the costume is a black jumpsuit, with long sleeves and a zip up the front. If possible, try to get a jumpsuit in a matte black color, though shiny PVC will work if not. If you can't get your hands on a jumpsuit, some tight black pants or leggings and a black zip-up or turtleneck sweater will do the trick.  A wide black belt should be worn around the waist to imitate Catwoman's utility belt. However, if you could get your hands on a real gun holster, that would be even better!  , Anne Hathaway's Catwoman, unlike the others, does not wear a headpiece, but wears a simple black mask and headpiece, with her hair worn loose down her back. In this respect, she is similar to the version of Catwoman portrayed by Julie Newmar in the 1960s series Batman. Any plain black mask (that just covers the eyes) will work for this outfit, along with a headband or clips with cat ears attached.   You can make your own mask using black felt (an embossed black works really well for this particular costume). Simply draw the outline of the mask onto the piece of felt, cut it out neatly, and attach a length of black elastic to either side to form a mask.To make your own cat ears: cut out two triangular-shaped pieces from some black cardstock, glue black PVC or felt fabric to both sides of the cardstock, then attach each ear to a black alligator clip.  Any kind of long black gloves will work for this costume, just try to get ones which reach above your elbow.  Perhaps the most attention-grabbing aspect of this Catwoman's outfit are her thigh-high, black leather boots. If you have some in your wardrobe already - great! If not, you may need to trawl through some shoes stores or websites to find the perfect pair. The heels should be 4 or 5 inches (10.2 or 12.7 cm) high.   Of course, knee-high black boots will do in pinch - it all depends on how true to the movie you want your costume to be.  Rather than carrying a whip, Anne Hathaway's Catwoman has a gun -- she means serious business. Find a fake black gun in any costume store. If you managed to find a gun holster belt, you can store it there!  , Unlike the other costumes, where hair is tied back or tucked underneath the mask, this look allows hair to be left loose. Anne Hathaway's hair was straight, but had plenty of volume. To achieve a similar effect, apply mousse to wet hair then blow dry hair straight, holding your head upside down. Pull the hair back from the face using the cat-ear headband or clips.  To begin, apply your favorite foundation -- but mix it with a little white face paint first, as Catwoman is usually pale. Blend it well, using a stippling brush to create a flawless finish. Set the foundation with a loose translucent powder. Don’t use concealer beneath your eyes -- you want to have slight dark circles.  Apply a matte taupe eyeshadow all over your lids; this will create depth and shadows. Bring the taupe shadow down towards the sides of your nose. Next, apply a dark brown eyeshadow around the creases of your eyelids, then apply a dark black eyeshadow to the center of your lids, blending it outwards.   Apply the black eyeshadow to your lower lash line with a small, angled brush, bringing it right into the corner of the eye. It should look a little messy. Use a cotton swab to blend the shadow on your lower lash line to give a hazy, smoky effect. Line the inner rim of your bottom lashes using a black eyeliner. Curl your eyelashes, then apply a black mascara generously to upper and lower lashes.  Define your eyebrows with a brow pencil – give them an elaborate arch. Apply white eyeliner beneath the arch of the eyebrow to give it more depth and apply a matte white eyeshadow to the brow bone to highlight. Set your eyebrows with brow gel.  Line your lips with a red lip liner, then fill in the lines with your favorite red lipstick. Use a brush to make a precise shape, referring to a specific Catwoman picture for reference. Use concealer to add extra definition to the outside of your lips. Apply a red lip gloss to the center of your lips, on top of the lipstick. Your lips should look playful and devious.

 You'll find out why later.  Just stay there for a second, and whatever you do, do NOT go into his space., Let the door close, leaving you safe, and leaving Sarge trapped with his minions., This is what you needed the whip for, and even though any other weapon works, this one's probably the easiest., Remember, Sarge only has three lives, so on your third hit, he'll fall, opening both doors for you., You defeated Sarge! 

choose a character with a whip.  once you open the doors to the area, go into the little space before the next door in the ring, right before you start.  right when you go through the door, go back into the little space again.  once he gets close enough, whip him.  stay there and keep hitting.  hooray!

 Potty training your puggle is crucial. People often give up their dogs due to behavioral issues, which can be prevented with careful training while the dog is young.To house train your dog, you will need to keep a careful toileting schedule for him. Take him out to go potty several times per day, especially after meals. You will also need to watch him while he is in the house to prevent him from going potty indoors.   If you notice that your puggle is about to go potty in the house, gently pick him up and take him outside. If you are too late, then do not yell at your dog or hit him or rub his nose in the urine. These measures do not do anything but frighten the dog. Instead, clean up the mess right away and take him out to his potty spot. You may also want to keep some puppy pads or newspapers around while you are house training your dog. This will help to ensure that he always has a place to go potty if he has an emergency or if you are not around.  Crate training can be helpful with house training and preventing your dog from chewing on tings he shouldn’t as well. It is important to note that crate training is not a means to punish your dog. Your dog’s crate should be a place that he likes to go, as if it is his den.   If you decide to crate train your dog, make sure that you get a crate that is large enough for him to stand up, turn around, and lay down in. If the crate is too large or to small, then it will not be as comforting for your dog. Place some comfortable bedding and a toy inside of your dog’s crate to make it more appealing to him. Try leaving the crate door open for the first couple of weeks so that your dog can investigate the crate and use it as he pleases.  Teaching your puggle some basic commands will also help to make him a well-behaved member of your family. Training a dog takes daily training sessions and lots of patience. Some other good things to keep in mind when training your puggle include:   Rewards. Use rewards to motivate your dog and never yell at him or hit him to teach him something. Dogs respond much better to positive reinforcement, so make sure that you give your puggle lots of praise, petting, and treats when he follows a command. Length of training sessions. Dogs have short attention spans, so it is best to keep training sessions under 10 minutes long. If your puggle starts to lose interest, then just give him a command that he has already mastered, reward him for obeying, and end the session.  Puggles are pretty friendly dogs, but all dogs need to be socialized to prevent them developing fearful or aggressive responses to strangers and new situations. Start by taking your puggle out on walks (on a leash) while he is a puppy and invite people over often as well to help you socialize your puggle. Make sure that you do not expose your puggle to other dogs until he has had his first round of vaccinations.Be sure to expose your puggle to:   people of different genders, races, ages, and sizes cats and other dogs people in unusual clothing, wearing coats or hats, holding umbrellas, etc. loud noises and crowds of people bikes, cars, rollerblades, skateboards, etc.  

train your puggle to go to the bathroom outside.  think about crate training your puggle.  teach your puggle some basic commands.  socialize your puggle early. 

 Macro analysis has its basis in the large (Macro) tendencies observed in the economy. Your goal is to understand how major forces are affecting the performance of the economy. Then, base your investment decisions on your findings.   For example, if the economy is performing poorly (inflation and unemployment are high while national output is low), avoid overpaying for stocks and be sure to diversify your stocks.; , The most important macro indicators include: GDP (gross domestic product), CPI (consumer price indices), PPI (producer price indices), unemployment rate, interest rates (Fed Funds, prime rate, etc), inflation rate, and balance of trade. You can either download the historical data to Excel or access an interactive graph using online tools.Go to the websites of the Bureau of Economic Analysis (http://www.bea.gov/) or the Bureau of Labor Statistics (http://www.bls.gov/) to access the data., Look for the general direction that the numbers are moving in and any patterns that may emerge. Take into account: the historical data you found, current data, and news. The website will have a separate series of data already converted to percent for either Year over Year or Quarter over Quarter.   If not, you can determine the percentage of change for an indicator. For example, divide the nominal GDP (in numbers) of one year by the value from the previous year. This gives you the GDP growth percentage for Year over Year.  Investing in a broad based stock or stock alternative might be the most convenient with this method of analysis. Select a group of stocks that reflect the movement of the broader economy and track an index like the Dow Jones Industrial average or S&P 500.This approach allows you to enjoy the growth of stocks in the US in general without risking all your money on one or just a few stocks.   Understand that macro analysis doesn't specifically help you decide which individual stocks to buy. Instead, it simply lets you understand the performance of the economy. For example, you may want to buy stocks when you think the economy will improve and sell when you think it will deteriorate.  

understand how macro analysis works.  gather data or access a graph.  observe and interpret the data.  pick your stocks. 

 Taping your foot to treat plantar fasciitis can reduce the pain associated with plantar fasciitis. It helps support your foot when you engage in physical activity to reduce strain.It can also help minimize stress and inflammation.   Keeping your foot stretched helps your foot loosen and heal in an elongated position so it doesn’t shorten during the night. The main goal in taping your foot is to keep the foot flexed, with the toes pointing or pulled toward your head, until you feel a stretch in the bottom of your foot. Make sure you only feel a gentle stretch in your foot.  You may start seeing symptoms when you feel pain under your heel or in the arch of your foot. This often occurs when you stand up in the morning or after resting your feet for an extended period of time.After some time walking, the pain decreases.   Pain may be felt after long periods of standing, physical activity, running, or sitting. Many times, the pain is felt while exercising. The pain is usually described as stabbing, but it can also be described as aching or burning., The plantar fascia bears all our weight and has been described as a sort of bowstring supporting the arch of the foot. Anything that causes increased strain on this area of the foot can cause plantar fasciitis. Plantar fasciitis may occur when the plantar fascia tightens, shortens, or becomes inflamed.Causes include:Obesity Footwear that does not support the arch adequately or fits improperly Overload because of physical activity, such as running, jumping, or jogging Arthritis Diabetes Existing foot problems, such as flat feet or high arches Abnormal gait and way of walking Overtraining  

understand the importance of taping or stretching your foot.  recognize the symptoms of plantar fasciitis.  learn the causes of plantar fasciitis. 

 CMS uses notes, rather than in-text citations, to cite references. Place a superscript as soon as possible after the quote or clause being referenced.

 If you are being sued as part of a class action, then you need a lawyer’s assistance to head off the class certification. You are also probably being sued for a large amount of money, since the class plaintiffs are pooling all of their claims against you. It is therefore critical that you defeat class certification, and a qualified attorney is a must.   Should you defeat the class certification, then the individual plaintiffs must bring individual lawsuits. They can’t bundle their claims in a class action. As a result, some plaintiffs might not want to sue, and others won’t have injuries worth enough money for a lawyer to represent them. You can avoid many lawsuits if you prevent class certification. If you don’t know how you can afford a lawyer, then look at any insurance policies that you have. You may have products liability coverage (if your product injured the plaintiffs), professional malpractice insurance, or homeowners’ insurance. Read your insurance policy. Some policies contain “duty to defend” provisions. In that situation, the insurer agrees to defend you against lawsuits if there is potential that the claim will be covered by the policy.; , A class action will be brought in state or federal court. In order to be certified as a class, it needs to meet the requirements for certification. The requirements for certification in state and federal court are similar. Indeed, many state rules have been modeled on the federal certification rule.To find the rule, you can visit your local law library and ask the librarian to show you the rule on class certification. Your nearest law library may be at the courthouse or at the nearest law school. Your lawyer should also show you the law and discuss whether the plaintiffs can meet the certification requirements.  To qualify for class certification, federal law requires that the plaintiffs show that they share common questions of law or fact.You should look at the injuries the plaintiffs claim to have suffered and see if they are similar or actually different.   For example, a group of plaintiffs might sue you for prescribing a certain pill. However, you might have prescribed it to treat very different illnesses and in different dosages. If some plaintiffs took the pill to treat one disease, and another group took the pill to treat a different disease, then the plaintiffs might not all share common questions of law or fact.  Each class action has a group of plaintiffs representing the entire class. They are the ones who show up in court, and whose lawyers actually handle the case. In order to serve in their role as “representative plaintiffs,” their claims must be typical of the entire class.You can defeat class certification by showing how the representative plaintiffs have claims that differ substantially from those of the other class members. Although the representative plaintiffs might have all used the same pill to treat joint pain, 90% of the rest of the class might have used the pill for other reasons.  In order to certify the class, the judge has to agree that the representative plaintiffs can fairly and adequately represent the interests of the entire class.Typically, you argue that the representative plaintiffs do not have experienced lawyers. For example, the attorneys might never have handled this kind of lawsuit before. If the class action is for medical malpractice, then lawyers who specialize in real estate will probably not provide adequate representation. You might also allege that there is a conflict of interest between the lawyers who represent the representative plaintiffs and the other plaintiffs in the entire class.For example, if a class representative’s child is married to lead counsel, then you could allege that there is a conflict of interest.In this example, a court might be worried that the class representative and the lawyer have only each other’s best interest in mind, not the best interest of the entire class of plaintiffs.  When you are sued for money damages, plaintiffs will need to show how a class action is superior to other methods of resolving the dispute, such as individual lawsuits. Plaintiffs must also argue that common questions (whether of law or fact) “predominate” over individual ones.You might be sued for an injunction. An injunction is a legal order commanding you to stop doing something. When class plaintiffs file for an injunction, they need to show that you have acted in a way that applies generally to the class.To show that the class action is not a “superior” method of resolving the dispute, you should argue that individual issues predominate over common ones. You can do this by showing how dissimilar the claims are and argue that it would be too costly and time-consuming to litigate a class action.  With this motion, your lawyer will argue that class certification is inappropriate for any of the reasons discussed above: there is a lack of commonality, typicality, adequate representation, or predominance of common issues.   You will file this motion in response to the plaintiffs’ motion to certify the class. Because the motion is so critical, you should have your lawyer draft it for you. If you win, then the class is not certified and plaintiffs will need to bring individual lawsuits or form smaller classes. Often, many of these lawsuits will disappear. For example, if the plaintiffs were each suing you for $25, then an individual lawsuit might not be worth their time. Also, a lawyer will not represent someone on contingency when low damage amounts are in play.  Class actions are often brought in mass accident cases, like a plane crash. They are also brought in cases when a medicine or medical device injures a large number of people. These cases often require expert witnesses to testify that your product or conduct caused the plaintiffs’ injuries. You also might use an expert to testify as to what you should have done when treating patients.   You and your lawyer should line up legal experts of your own. If the plaintiff has an expert, then you will need an expert as well. Often, these kinds of lawsuit turn on “dueling experts,” each of whom says something different. The jury must then decide which expert to believe. Your lawyer should be familiar with experts who are willing to testify for the defense in your kind of lawsuit. You also will need to do background research on the plaintiff’s expert. Not only do you present your own expert, but you will also try to undermine the plaintiff’s expert. You can challenge an expert’s educational credentials, professional experience, and competency. Expert witnesses can be quite expensive. For example, a non-medical expert witness charges on average $248. A medical expert witness charges around $555.Experts also charge for reviewing the file, giving a deposition, and preparing their testimony.  Jury selection in class actions can be critical, particularly if you represent a large corporation. Research evidence suggests that juries will treat corporations more harshly than they do poor or even wealthy individuals.Your lawyer should prepare extensively for jury selection. He or she may even hire a jury expert, who will try to uncover the hidden biases of individual jurors.  A trial begins with each side’s attorney making an opening statement. The purpose of the opening statement is to give the jury some sense of what evidence will be presented and what this evidence will show.   Opening statements are not evidence themselves. Sometimes, a lawyer might never present evidence mentioned in the opening statement. Instead, the purpose of the statement is to provide the jurors with a roadmap of what the trial will be about and what kinds of issues you and the plaintiffs disagree about.  As the defendant, you will have to wait for the plaintiffs to present their case first. Your lawyer will then cross-examine their witnesses and expert witnesses. The purpose of cross-examination is to challenge the credibility of the witnesses so that the jury has doubts about their stories.   If this is a personal injury lawsuit, then your lawyer will have to be delicate when handling the class representatives. They probably have suffered debilitating injuries and might appear quite sympathetic to the jury. For this reason, your attorney may ask the witness only basic information. Some attorneys might not ask any questions of the witness. Your lawyer can be more aggressive with expert witnesses. For example, she might challenge the expert’s testimony by citing a published article or book in which the expert expressed a contrary opinion than the one he is giving on the witness stand., After the plaintiffs present their case, you will be able to present yours. If the plaintiffs used an expert witness, then you will also present your own expert witness.   You might even have to testify yourself at trial, particularly where your actions are in dispute. If you have to testify, then your lawyer should have helped prepare you for the testimony by doing practice sessions beforehand. To testify effectively, remember the following:Sit up straight and look at the attorney who is asking you questions. As you answer, turn to the jury and look at the jurors. Listen carefully to the question and answer only the question asked. Don’t volunteer information. Answer as simply and clearly as possible. If you don’t understand a question, ask for clarification. Don’t gesture as you testify. That can be distracting. Tell the truth and don’t look at your lawyer when you are cross-examined. When you look repeatedly at your attorney, it creates the impression that you are looking for help.  Jurors would benefit from visual aids if the subject of the trial is complicated. For example, if the lawsuit involves dangerous side-effects of medicines, then lawyers might use models or diagrams of the human body to show how the medicine interacted with the body.   Your lawyer might also blow up or enlarge portions of important records, such as medical records.The jurors will remember the key portion of the document you want to highlight if you enlarge it in this way. Your lawyer could also create a video animation, if that would help make the evidence easier to understand for the jury. The animation recreates an accident, event, or medical procedure., At the close of evidence, your lawyer will make a closing argument. The purpose is to argue to the jury that the evidence did not show that you are at fault for the plaintiffs’ injuries. The precise legal arguments will depend on the type of lawsuit.   In a class action, the standard of proof is usually a “preponderance of evidence.” This means “more likely than not.”in other words, the evidence must lean 50.1% in the plaintiffs’ favor. Accordingly, if the plaintiffs are suing for personal injuries caused by your product, you can argue that the evidence is 50.1% in your favor, or at least divided equally, 50-50. In either situation, you will win.  The judge will read the jurors their instructions and then allow them to retire for deliberations. In state court, the jury probably does not need to reach a unanimous verdict. In federal court they still do., The greatest threat in a class action is that the jury will award a huge amount of damages to the plaintiffs. Because the plaintiffs are all pooling their cases together, damage awards can often exceed $10 million or more.   Also, if you are corporation, jurors might be inclined to think that you can afford to pay such a large amount. You can file a motion with the court and ask that the damages amount be reduced. This is called a motion for “remittitur.” Your lawyer should draft it. In the motion, he or she will argue that the amount of damages awarded is so great as to “shock the conscience.”, You can also appeal if you lose. Before appealing, you should talk over the strengths and weaknesses of an appeal with your lawyer. You can’t appeal simply because you are unhappy. Instead, you need to point to errors the judge or jury made.  A valid arbitration clause will allow you to avoid having to defend yourself in court. Instead, you can remove the dispute to arbitration, which is like a trial except that a private person (not a judge) hears the lawsuit. You can draft arbitration agreements in such a way that you reserve the right to arbitrate each case individually, thus avoiding class actions.You should have a lawyer draft the arbitration clause so that it is valid in your state.  For example, if you run a business, then include it in your employee contracts. If you provide a service, then you can also include it in the service agreement.   Generally, what you put in your terms of service will be considered a contract, provided you don’t try to hide the arbitration agreement., If you are sued by a group of plaintiffs, some of who have signed an arbitration clause, then you can file a motion in court to compel arbitration. You can file this instead of an answer.Arbitration agreements are valid contracts, and people are free to sign away their right to sue in a court or as part of a class action. Once you remove the case to arbitration, you will only have to defend yourself against individual suits in arbitration. Of course, you might prefer to defend against only one lawsuit (though the risks of suffering a huge money damage are higher if you take this route). You should talk it over with your attorney. You have the option of not enforcing the arbitration agreement and proceeding in court if you choose.  

hire a lawyer.  read the applicable law.  identify differences in the plaintiffs’ claims.  allege that the representative plaintiffs’ claims are atypical.  argue that the representative plaintiffs are not adequate representatives.  argue that the class action is not a superior way of resolving the disputes.  draft an opposition to motion for class certification.  line up expert witnesses.  select a jury.  present opening statements.  challenge the plaintiffs’ witnesses.  present your own witnesses.  use visual aids and demonstrative exhibits.  deliver a closing argument.  wait for the jury verdict.  ask the judge to reduce the damages.  appeal, if necessary.  draft arbitration clauses.  include the clause in all contracts.  file a motion to compel arbitration.

 Cats usually do not respond emotionally to miscarriages the way people would. In rare cases, however, cats may become distressed and engage in behaviors such as pacing and acting agitated. In these cases, it's a good idea to isolate the cat in a calming environment.Place your cat in a quiet room free of outside noise and distraction. Have everything she needs, such as food, water, and a litter box, in the room. You should also provide a warm bed. Distressed cats often simply need space. However, you should check in on your cat on occasion. If she seems social, gently pet her and talk to her to calm her down.  At home, follow the instructions you were given by your vet. Cats can safely recover from a miscarriage without a lot of intervention as long as they receive proper treatment. If your vet prescribed any medication or made any other recommendations for care, follow instructions closely.Do not hesitate to call your vet if you have any questions. It's vital that you make sure you're caring for your cat correctly.  Most of the time, a cat will recovery from a miscarriage on her own with minimal intervention. However, monitor your cat closely after a miscarriage to make sure there are no complications.Some cats may bleed heavily after a miscarriage or have other discharge near the anal area. If you notice heavy bleeding or discharge, see a vet. If your cat seems to be in a lot of pain, you should also see a vet.  

isolate your cat if necessary.  treat underlying conditions according to your vet's instructions.  watch for signs of complications. 

 Choose brown hooded sweatshirts with matching pants that fit comfortably. You can find a sweat suit at a thrift store, at Walmart, or online, if you cannot find one in your town.  Place it over your child's head and pull the ties so that it fits snuggly and frames your child's head. Pin a safety pin at the top of where you will want the monkey ears to be., The piece should be approximately 8.5 by 11 inches (21.6 by 28 cm). Fold the piece of fleece in half on the 11 inch (28 cm) side., You can cut an oval out on 1 side of the folded fleece, near the edge, and then place 1 of the ovals on the other side of the fleece to serve as a template., At 1 end of each oval, cut a horizontal line to create a flat end. This is where you will attach the ears to the hoodie., Flip the ovals inside out when you are done., Pin the flat end of the oval shut., Make sure that the oval is at least 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) smaller on all sides than your brown ovals. These will form the inside of your monkey ears., Repeat on the other ear. Allow the glue to dry before sewing again., Align the ear so that it touches the safety pin at the top. Pin the ear in place.,, If you are making this costume for an adult, add a few inches (5 to 7 cm) to each measurement to fill up more of the belly portion of the hoodie.,, Allow it to dry before sewing further., Sew it into place with brown thread. You have completed your monkey suit., Place the hoodie over the head carefully. Pull the hoodie strings tight and tie them under the chin so that the ears stand out to the sides.  For extra embellishment with your homemade monkey costume, give the costumed person a banana to carry.  

shop for a brown sweat suit with the person for whom you are making the costume.  ask your child to try on the hoodie.  take 1 piece of brown fleece.  cut 4 inch (10.2 cm) long ovals out of the brown fleece to make your ears.  place each pair of fleece ovals with the front sides together and pin.  sew around the outside of the ears by hand or on a sewing machine, leaving the flat end of the oval open.  stuff the inside of the ears with pipe cleaners to make them stand up on their own.  cut out 3 inch (7.6 cm) long ovals from your tan felt.  glue 1 piece of tan felt on top of your brown fleece ear with fabric glue.  place 1 of your hands inside the hoodie on the right side.hand sew the oval ears onto each side of the hoodie in the spot you have previously measured.  cut 2 circles of tan felt that are approximately 8 inches by 10 inches (20.3 by 25.4 cm).glue the 2 circles together to make a thick attachment that will appear sturdy on your costume.  glue the belly circle onto the center and front of your hoodie.  pin a brown marabou boa to the back center of your brown hoodie.  have the costume-wearer put on the brown sweatpants and some brown shoes. 

,, This is called your "turning chain"  ,, A circle has formed.  You can stop in any round.  Double crochets twice in each stitch. Slip stitch into the third chain of your " turning chain". You will notice that your circle is more wide.  Double crochet into the stitch under the turning chain. *In the next stitch double crochet once, in the next stitch double crochet twice. Repeat from* all the way around. Slip stitch into the third chain of your turning chain.  * In the next two stitches double crochet once, in the third stitch double crochet twice. Repeat from * all the way around. Slip stitch into the third chain of your turning chain  , * In the next three stitches, double crochet once, in the fourth stitch double crochet twice. Repeat from* all the way around. Slip stitch into the third chain of your turning chain.  If you wish to finish it, cut the yarn and pull the yarn through the last stitch. Weave in the ends.  

chain 6 stitches;  ,slip stitch through the first chain to form a ring  ,  chain 3 more stitches.  crochet 11 double crochets into the center of the ring.  ,  slip stitch into the third chain (the upper one) of your "turning chain".  to make the circle wide, we need to increase it.  second round: chain 3, double crochet into the stitch under the turning chain.  third round: chain 3.  fourth round: chain 3, double crochet into the stitch under the turning chain.  fifth round: chain 3, double crochet into the stitch under the turning chain.  if you wish to continue, just double crochet once in every stitch and repeat for every round. 

 The best chance of your ears healing depends on how nice you were to your ears during the stretching process. If you barged ahead and sized up every other week, you most likely caused small tears and potentially ripped the delicate tissue of your holes. If you allowed them to heal for at least a month before sizing up, that will speed up the healing process and your ears will thank you.  Remember never to stretch dry. Always use some kind of lube, like a special stretching balm, Vitamin E oil, or coconut oil. Stretching in or after a hot shower has been said to help with the stretching process. Also, tapers are not meant to be worn as jewelry, because the weight is uneven, so only use them for stretching. Don't use acrylic or silicone tapers; although acrylic tapers are the cheapest and easiest to find, acrylic can't be fully sterilized, and silicone tapers can cause blowouts due to trapped bacteria.; , For example, if your normal gauge is a 000 (10.4 mm), put a 00 (9.26 mm) in your ear.   If you have gone above a 12 mm g, it is unlikely that you will experience much shrinkage. This is because stretching your ears involves (surprise, surprise) stretching--you stretch the tissue of your ear and then allow it to heal. If blowouts, tearing or infections occur, scar tissue builds up which can sometimes keep ear lobes from shrinking back to normal once they have been stretched. Of course, everyone's body is different. Just be aware of the potential that your ears might not shrink back without surgery., You should wear the smaller gauge until your ear has shrunk down so that this gauge fits well. This may take only a few days for some people, and longer than a week for others.  The smallest is a 17g (1.14 mm). Most wire earrings are .812 mm and studs are 1.02 mm. 

gauge correctly in the first place.  decrease the the gauge you are wearing by 'going down' one size.  wear the smaller gauge for a week.  repeat this process until you are wearing the smallest gauge. 

 Betta are very curious fish and they are entertained by new things they can explore. They also like to have places to hide and places to relax in their tanks, so adding objects to their tanks is key to their happiness.   Either find items to put in the tank that are made to go in fish tanks or items that can be thoroughly cleaned, will not fall apart in water, and are non-toxic. If it's small enough and clean enough, you can put it in the Betta's tank! There are a wide variety of products made for Betta tanks specifically. At the very least, consider adding a fake plant for your Betta to hide or relax in.While you do want to give you Betta places to hide and explore, you also need to give it enough open space to swim around freely. Don't overcrowd the tank with too much stuff!; , Get a small floating toy or a fishing bobber. You don't want to cover the entire surface of the tank, as Betta come up to the surface to get air, but you can float a few fun toys for the Betta to play with.   Make sure the toy is clean before you place it in the water. Put a small plastic ping-pong ball in the top of the tank.See what the betta does! Some Betta will push it around their tank. If the Betta doesn't play with the ball immediately, give your fish some time to get used to it.  This is a great way to entertain your fish. Fish or Aquarium specific stores often offer live worms that most Betta will chase with zeal.   Always feed your Betta a balanced, varied diet. Too many treats or meals will not be good for your fish but they can be given once in a while with no problem. You just don't want to feed them too much and get them sick!  

add objects to the bottom of your betta's tank.  try adding bobbing objects to the top of the tank.  feed your betta live food occasionally. 

 Some growers use pheromone traps to monitor the population. If your traps catch 20 to 30 moths a night for 3 to 5 nights in a row, begin your weekly checks.   Check high-risk areas first if you are a high-volume grower. Check late-planted corn, fields that are flowering or have young pots, and those growing on elevated areas of the land. Corn grown on elevated areas or knolls is more vulnerable to egg laying.; , They lay eggs on the silk attached to the husks, which gives larvae easy access to the ears.  If you are growing several acres of corn, take at least 1 sample per 4 acres. If you are simply checking a home garden, only 1 sample is necessary.  A 3-foot-long cloth allows you to sample 6 row feet if you check the plants on both sides. , Check the sheet to see how many worms are on it are at least 3/8-inches long. Worms smaller than that can not do plant damage and may not survive long enough to be a problem.  If you used a 6-foot-row sample, you would divide the number of worms by 6. Your tolerance threshold is determined by row foot count and varies with the specific crop and the percentage of it under attack.   If you are growing a small amount of corn for your own consumption even one per plant may be too many. Many large production growers usually have a higher threshold.  

check your corn plants for earworms weekly when moth activity in your area has peaked.  keep an eye on the silk when it forms to see how many eggs the earworms lay.  pick an area to check in several different spots throughout your fields.  lay a cloth or sheet of flexible material on the ground between 2 rows of corn.  bend each bordering plant over the sheet and beat it vigorously with your hand or a small stick.  ,  count the number of earworms.  determine the number of earworms per row foot. 

 Let the oil warm as you prepare.; , This just takes a few seconds. If you aren’t sure whether or not the oil is hot enough, look for tiny surface ripples or place your hand a few inches above the pan and gauge the radiant heat.  If you don’t have a sieve with small enough holes, rinse it in a cheesecloth or dish towel.  Make sure it mixes well with the garlic.  Salt the water if desired; alternatively, add a cube of chicken bouillon to the water and let it dissolve as the water heats.  It only needs to boil for a few seconds.  Note that simmering rice has a tendency to create white foam that bubbles out onto your stovetop; if foam is a problem for you, set the lid askew until the mixture gets drier, then cover completely.  The grains should be plump and soft, and not pasty.  

put oil in a medium to large pan and turn to medium-high.  when the oil hot enough, add garlic and fry until brown.  rinse rice in a sieve.  add wet rice to the pan and stir.  add water to the pan.  turn the heat up to bring the water to a boil.  turn down the heat, cover, and simmer gently for 15-20 minutes without peeking.  turn off the heat, uncover, and fluff the rice with a fork. 

 Before you pay for an online course, you should be realistic about your ability to manage your time and to follow a structured schedule for the course.   Ensure that you have enough time to dedicate to studying, finishing your assignments, and passing the class. This course will be taught at a college level. If you feel uncertain about your abilities to complete college-level coursework, this might not be the best option for you. Set goals for yourself. If you’re not confident in your computer skills, you should consider strengthening them before taking an online course. It might be a good idea to narrow down the list of most needed skills to just a few items to make sure you can develop those skills in time before the course begins.; , Many courses will list a summary of what the course will cover, a syllabus of the work that will be required, or have pre-requisites that you must complete prior to the course.   If you are taking this online course for a degree program, make sure that you have completed any pre-requisites for the course. If you are attending another college, but taking this online course through a different university, check with your university to make sure that this credit will be accepted towards your degree. Purchase or borrow any required textbooks or course materials prior to the start date of your class.  For most online college courses, you will need to ensure that you have enough hard drive memory and that you are using the most up to date operating systems for your laptop or desktop computer.   If you do not meet these requirements, the online course module may not work correctly and you will be unable to complete the course.Technical courses may have specific requirements for the amount of RAM, hard drive space available, and the operating system that you use. You will need consistent and reliable access to the Internet for your course. Hone and practice your computer skills if you are uncertain whether they are strong enough for the course. You can even enroll in a brief computer literacy class before starting the course.  Beginning the course with a good relationship with your professor can be a very helpful way to establish a good rapport with them for the rest of the course.   Before the course begins, reach out to your professor. This can be a simple email introducing yourself to the instructor and letting them know that you’re excited to begin the course with them. If you ever have the opportunity to speak with your professor in person, take advantage of it.  If you work part time or full time, you should let your employer know that you are taking college classes online so they are aware of your time restrictions.   If you work full time, see if your employer offers tuition reimbursement or tuition reimbursement. If you have an HR department, they will be the best resource for this inquiry.If you work part time or have a flexible work schedule, ensure that your work schedule does not conflict with your study schedule or any scheduled class times. If you have children at home, arrange childcare before the course begins. It can be very difficult to focus on online coursework if you are caring for children at the same time. Arrange for consistent childcare during the times you know will be doing coursework and studying., Find a place where you will be able to consistently work and study without distractions.   If you plan to do classwork at home, make sure that you will not be distracted by family members or roommates while you’re working. Cafes and coffee shops usually have consistent Internet access. Check with the owner to make sure that you are able to occupy a table for extended amounts of time. Libraries are a good option if you prefer to work in a quiet space. Many have desktop computers available for your use, which is helpful if you do not have a laptop. Many public parks offer free wifi. You may find it relaxing to study in the park, as long as there are no distractions nearby.  As soon as you receive the course syllabus, write down the due dates for any important assignments, papers, and exams.   Many online courses require online assignment submissions to be made by a certain time. If each weekly assignment is due at 5pm on Sunday, make sure to note this specific time so you can keep your assignment submissions organized. Use a paper planer or online calendar to keep all of your assignment dates organized and accessible. If you are taking more than one course at a time, create a master list that has each of your course assignment due dates listed. Each week, organize your schedule and make a priority list for assignments that are due that week.  A study schedule will help you to stay organized as you progress through the course, and will help you manage your time efficiently.   Be as detailed as possible in your schedule. Plan ahead and take in to account any outside commitments that you’ve made like vacations or doctors visits that will disrupt your normal schedule. Use the list of assignment due dates that you wrote down at the beginning of the course to set aside time to study for large exams and to complete projects or papers. Stick to the schedule that you set for yourself. You will need to follow your schedule to accomplish your coursework on time. Create weekly to-do lists that map out your assignment deadlines and required coursework., Take detailed notes for each of your class readings and lectures either by hand or in an online document.Be prepared to take notes during each online lecture. Organized and detailed notes will be your best study tools to prepare for exams. It can be tempting to zone out or not pay attention during online lectures since you aren’t physically in a classroom, but taking notes can help you to avoid this temptation. Keep your notes in a centralized and organized space. If you take notes by hand, dedicate a large notebook or binder to holding all of your notes. If you take notes on your laptop, create an online file to hold all of your notes in one place.  Your online course will have specific deadlines for assignments, just as any other class would. Always meet these deadlines and produce your best work on assignments.   Online courses are great for independent learners since you are held accountable for your ability to follow a syllabus and meet deadlines outside of a physical classroom. You must reliably meet deadlines and turn in your work on time. Missing deadlines can have a large negative impact on your grade.Plan ahead if you know that you have a busy week coming up so you won’t have to struggle to get your work done.  Many online courses require students to participate in discussion board about class topics.   Posts on a discussion board often count as participation points and are an important part of your grade. Consistently post your responses or assignments to the discussion board on time and make meaningful additions to the discussion. Class discussions are also a great way to connect with your online classmates.  Online learning can feel isolating, especially if you are completing your degree completely online. Connecting with other online learners can foster a sense of community.   Some online classes may require group work during the course. While it can be challenging to complete assignments with students that you cannot physically meet with, group work is a great incentive to connect with your online classmates. Reach out to the online university that you are taking the class through. Many universities offer community websites and ways to connect with other online learners.If you find that you can meet with another online classmate in person, take this opportunity to get to know your classmate and arrange for a group study session.  Maintain your relationship with your professor throughout the course by communicating with them about assignments and exams.   Since most of your communication with your professor and peers will be through writing, you must be comfortable reaching out through written communications like email.Always keep your communications with professors professional and courteous, just as you would with any other instructor. Do not hesitate to reach out to the professor if you are struggling to understand a class concept or if you have questions.  

be realistic about your expectations.  carefully read the class requirements and syllabus.  confirm you meet the technical requirements.  connect with your professor.  notify your employer that you are taking classes.  set up a dedicated workspace.  make a list of course due dates.  create a study schedule.  take detailed notes.  meet course deadlines.  participate in discussions.  reach out to other online students.  keep in touch with your professor. 

 Be aware that "servicio de mesa" does not indicate a service charge, but the bread that comes with a meal. Tip no more than 10%.  If change is left over from your fare, you may give it to the driver, but this is not expected.  

refrain from tipping in restaurants if service is included.  refrain from tipping cab drivers, unless they carry heavy bags for you. 

 This will ensure that the crossbow is planted in the ground while you pull the string back with cocking ropes. It is important to note that there are a few ways to cock a crossbow. This instructional shows the cocking process with a set of cocking ropes, which is the most common method.; , This is crucial to correctly pulling back the bowstring. Put the middle of the cocking rope in the groove. This will tighten the cocking rope as you pull on the ropes.  It is very important that one does this step, as this is what creates the tight tension that helps actually pull the bowstring back. All modern crossbows that employ the cocking rope method of cocking have this groove, as depicted here.  Be sure the cocking ropes are on the bowstrings, one on either side of the barrel, with the hooks facing away from you.   For consistency in accuracy, mark the location on the bowstring where you place the cocking hooks with a marker. This will ensure that you put the hooks at the same spot every time, increasing consistency in accuracy. Be sure that the hooks are oriented correctly, with the open side of the hook facing outward.  This will ensure that you are pulling both ends of the rope at the same time   Make sure you pull both cocking ropes at the same time. Failure to do so will cause inconsistency in accuracy, as well as it will be difficult to pull the bowstring back.  Keep pulling until you hear 2-3 clicks. These sharp clicks indicate that your bowstring is cocked and in the ready position. At this point, it is important that you keep your finger off of the trigger, and the safety feature of your crossbow in the "on" position. This helps to ensure you do not accidentally pull the trigger of your bow.  Place the odd colored fletching, in this case white, down in the barrel groove first. Failure to do so will cause damage to the bow, as the bolt would not be placed, or nocked, against the bowstring correctly.  Most crossbows have a clip that helps to keep the bolt from sliding around.    Make sure, when the crossbow is off of safe, your finger is off of the trigger. This will prevent misfires and accidental discharge of the crossbow.  Place your finger on the trigger, and squeeze the trigger as you exhale.   Be sure to not jerk the crossbow as you squeeze the trigger. This will decrease accuracy. Keep the crossbow aimed at your intended target.    If your crossbow has a scope on it, you may have to adjust the settings on the scope itself. For help with that, make sure you consult your scope's manufacturer.  Place a bit of bowstring wax on the crossbow strings every few shots,m. This will ensure the strings do not dry out, as well as decrease the risk of bowstring breakage. Additionally, regular waxing will add to the life of your crossbow.  

place your foot in the cocking stirrup.  orient your cocking ropes.  place middle of bowstring on the groove on top of the bow by the stock.  place the rolling cocking hooks on the bowstring, on either side of the barrel.  pull the ropes slightly so that the handles are even with each other.  pull back in one forceful, fluid motion.  place one bolt into the barrel groove.  slide the bolt back into the barrel until it is firmly seated against the bowstring.  flick the crossbow off of "safe".  when you are ready, take an athletic stance, and aim down the scope or sights of your crossbow at your intended target.  examine your shot placement in your target, and make adjustments to your sites if necessary.  maintain your bow. 

 Typically, you’ll pursue a Bachelor of Science in Accounting, although your institution may vary slightly. A bachelor’s degree almost always requires successful completion of 120 semester hours or 180 quarter hours. Fortunately, because of the internet, you have the ability to attend college online or in person, which opens up your options when deciding what schools you’ll apply to.   Make sure that the institution you attend is accredited and able to confer your degree.; , Choosing the right college for you is an important step. After all, you’ll be spending your time, money, and countless hours there and you want to make sure that it’s the best fit for you. There are a variety of factors to consider when choosing a college, although you’ll do best to pick the four or five most important factors to help you narrow down your best college.Prioritize what’s important to you and rank the list, then compare your potential colleges to that list. Funding – what sort of scholarships and financial aid is available? Cost – what are tuition and fees? If you’ll be attending as a non-resident, remember those fees will be higher. National ranking – what’s the colleges overall national rank? What about their Accounting program’s rank?Extracurriculars – what sort of extracurricular opportunities are available to students?  , Your college or university will have specific institutional requirements about what classes you’ll need to successfully take to earn your degree. Built in to every degree are electives, which are classes that you take to enhance your education, but aren’t specifically required. To apply to take the Uniform CPA exam, Maryland requires that within your 120 or 180 completed hours that you take specific classes, and some of these may have to be taken as electives.Maryland’s course requirements specify that you must take, “30 semester hours or 45 quarter credit hours in Group I, which requires 27 semester or 41 quarter credit hours must be in accounting and related subjects, and 3 semester credit hours or 4.5 quarter credit hours must be in ethics.”The state requires candidates complete 1 course in auditing, cost accounting and U.S. Federal Taxes. In addition, the curriculum must include 9 hours of financial accounting and electives. Maryland requires students complete 21 hours in business courses, which include statistics, quantitative methods, economics, management, business finance, marketing, business communication, computer information systems and U.S. business law. Students must also complete a curriculum that includes business ethics, philosophy of ethics and accounting ethics. Meet with your Academic Advisor to make sure you’re on track.  To actually obtain your CPA license in Maryland, you’ll need to continue your education for what amounts to one, full-time academic year beyond your bachelor’s degree. As with your undergraduate degree, the state has specific course requirements within those extra classes that you have to take.   The State of Maryland recognizes several education programs in their continuing education efforts. If a program says that they’re certified by the state, double check the state’s website to make sure.To qualify for licensing, you’ll need to complete 150 semester or 225 quarter hours and complete the requirements of Group II Business-related education, which is defined on The Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing of the Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation’s website.  If you received your degree internationally from a foreign university or college, you’ll need to have your degree evaluated for equivalency. Contact the NASBA International Evaluation Service to have your degree audited and determine if your degree meets Maryland’s requirements or not.Do not use any other service, as the state will only accept an audit from NASBA. When you request your NASBA audit, make it clear that it is so that you can qualify to take the Uniform CPA exam.  You’ll need to provide your transcripts when you apply to sit for the CPA exam. These transcripts will show that you’ve graduated, are in good standing with your institution, and that you took the required classes. Also, this is a good time to make sure that you have photo identification and any other proof of identity that may be required at the exam.Some institutions charge a fee to process and send transcripts. You’ll need to send transcripts from every institution that you attended. No institution will process or send your transcripts if you owe any outstanding fees.  After you’ve gathered your documents, you’ll apply online to take the exam. This process begins with you requesting authorization to take the exam and your receiving permission to do so once your materials have been processed.You’ll be able to log into the website to check the status of your application.  Register online for the CPA exam. You’ll need a valid email address, and they suggest that you use your personal email so that you can control spam filters, should it be necessary. Once your application is processed and your registration is complete, you’ll be able to select the date that you’d prefer to take the exam.Be cautious when you enter your name in the registration area. Your photo identification must match the name you type exactly or you will be denied entry into the exam. If your name changes between the time that you register and that you sit for the exam, you’ll need to bring your official court documents of name change to the Board before the exam.  You will be required by law to pay a $67 fee to take the exam, whether this is your first time taking the exam or not. You can pay that fee online when you register. You’ll take four sections of the exam altogether, and each section has its own fee.The sections are:Auditing and Attestation Financial Accounting and Reporting Regulation Business Environment and Concepts Don’t register or pay for all sections at one time. Your application is only valid for six months, at which time you’ll have to reapply and re-pay the fees.  The Uniform CPA Examination is comprised of four parts: Auditing and Attestation, Financial Accounting and Reporting, Regulation, and Business Environment and Concepts and is a 14-hour exam. Study for and take one exam section at a time, ensuring that you have ample time to study and don’t have to re-register. There are several books at your local bookstore available to help you study for each section.Each section has groups of questions, which are called “testlets” Each testlet has multiple choice questions, although the fourth testlet (Business Environment and Concepts) will also have written communication tasks.  The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) is the only entity that offers the self-paced, home study course for students who complete the Uniform CPA examination. You must pass the ethics examination before you can be granted your CPA license in the state of Maryland.The course is offered in two formats – text and on-demand, which is a computer-integrated format., Candidates who pass the CPA examination and meet the work and ethics course requirements can apply for licensure in the state of Maryland. The application must include a Report of Practical Experience form and a certificate of completion for the ethics course from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.The state verifies the education of candidates in the application for the CPA examination.  The license candidate must have 2000 hours of experience in accounting duties that a licensed CPA verifies. These 2000 hours must be accumulated within three years preceding the application for your CPA license.You may work within the areas of academia, government, industry, or public practice. The candidate's work experience must be in accounting related duties. Duties can include providing financial advice, preparing tax documents, auditing or providing management advice. After your exam, you’ll work for one year (2000 hours) and then apply for your license.  Maryland requires licensed CPAs to complete 80 hours of continuing professional education (CPE) courses every two years in order to maintain a current license. Of the 80 hours, four must be in professional ethics.You don’t have continuation education requirements for your first renewal. Hold on to your CPE records for four years, just in case there’s an issue.

 A doctor who specializes in reading bone scans (radiologist) will send their interpretation of your results to your family doctor, who will then explain them to you — hopefully in simple terms. If you want to take a closer look, you can ask to see the original scan at your doctor's office or ask for a copy to take home.   Although your doctor will likely be reluctant to give you the original bone scan to take home, he must legally provide you with a copy if you ask. The office might charge you a small copying fee. A bone scan is done to show problems with bone metabolism — the process of building and recycling bone tissue.Some activity is normal, but too much or too little bone remodeling is a sign of disease or injury.; , Most bone scans take an image of the entire skeleton, but sometimes they're more focused on an injured or painful area, such as the wrist or spine.As such, learn a little about basic anatomy, especially the names of most of the bones in your bone scan. Search online for information or borrow a book from your local library.   You don't need to learn detailed physiology or anatomy, but you should know what bones the radiologist is referring to in her written report of your bone scan results. The most common bones that are noted on bone scans are the vertebrae (spinal bones), pelvis (ilium, ischium and pubis), ribs, wrists (carpal bones) and leg bones (femur and tibia).  Once you have an idea of the bones that are problematic on your bone scan, you also need to know on which side of your body it is. You often can't tell just by looking at your body image, but all diagnostic images including bones scans have to be labelled in terms of which side is the patient's right and which is left.As such, look for words such as left, right, front or back on the image to get orientated.   Bone scan images can be taken from either your front or back. Looking at the head, you can sometimes see from which direction it was taken, but not always. Instead of words, bone scans and other diagnostics images may be orientated by marker letters, such as L (left), R (right), F (front) or B (back).  If you have more than one bone scan taken over time, which is common when following the progression of a bone disease or condition, then determine the dates (and times) that each was taken by looking at the label. Study the earlier one first, then compare it to later ones and take note of all the changes. If there isn't much difference, then it's likely your condition hasn't progressed (or improved).   If you have osteoporosis, for example, your doctor will likely recommend a yearly or bi-yearly bone scan to monitor progression of the disease. If a bone infection is suspected, images may be taken shortly after the radio-tracer is injected into you and again three to four hours later when it's collected in your bones — this is called a 3-phase bone scan., The test results of a bone scan are considered normal when the radioactive dye is spread and absorbed evenly throughout your skeleton; however, a bone scan is considered abnormal when it shows darker colored "hot spots" in your bones.Hot spots show areas in your skeleton where an excess of dye accumulates, which could signify bone destruction, inflammation, fractures or tumor growth.   Diseases that cause bone destruction include aggressive types of cancer, bacterial bone infection and osteoporosis (leads to weakening and fractures). Some bones can normally appear slightly darker than other bones because of their increased metabolic activity. Examples include your sternum (breastbone) and parts of your pelvis. Don't mistake these for diseases. In some cases, as with lesions resulting from multiple myeloma, hot spots will not appear on a bone scan. A CT or PET scan may be more helpful to identify signs of this type of cancer.  Test results are also considered abnormal when there are lighter colored "cold spots" in your bones.Cold spots indicate areas that absorb less radioactive dye (or none) compared to surrounding bones due to reduced activity and remodeling. In general, cold spots are usually a sign of decreased blood flow to an area for some reason.   Lytic lesions — associated with multiple myeloma, bone cysts, and certain bone infections — may show up as cold spots. Cold spots can indicate poor circulation due to a blood vessel blockage (atherosclerosis) or benign tumor. Cold spots and hot spots can appear simultaneously on a bone scan and represent different but concurrent diseases or conditions. Although lighter cold spots are abnormal, they typically represent conditions that are less serious than those represented by darker hot spots.  The radiologist will interpret your bone scan results and send a report to your doctor, who will use that information along with other diagnostic studies and/or blood tests to establish a diagnosis. Common diagnoses that stem from abnormal bone scan results include: osteoporosis, bone fractures, bone cancer, bone infection, arthritis, Paget's disease (a bone disorder involving thickening and softening of bones) and avascular necrosis (death of bone due to lack of blood supply.With the notable exception of avascular necrosis, which shows up as cold spots on a bone scan, all the other above-mentioned conditions show up as hot spots. Common osteoporosis hot spots to see on a bone scan include the upper thoracic spine (mid back), the hip joints and/or the wrists. Osteoporosis leads to fractures and bone pain. Cancer hot spots can be seen in virtually any bone. Bone cancer often spreads (metastasizes) from other cancer sites, such as the breasts, lungs, liver, pancreas and prostate gland. Paget's disease causes hot spots along the spine, pelvis, long bones and skull.Bone infections are most common in the leg, feet, hand and arm bones.  Although you don't need to make any special preparations before taking a bone scan, you should dress in comfortable, easily removed clothes and refrain from wearing any jewelry.Metal jewelry and watches, in particular, should be left at home or removed just prior to the bone scan because they can affect the results.   Like other diagnostic imaging tests, such as x-rays, any metal on your body will make the bone scan images look white or lighter than surrounding areas. Tell the radiologist and/or technician if you have any metal fillings in your mouth or metal implants in your body, so they can make note of it and not confuse them with diseases processes. Wearing clothes that are easily removed is a good idea because you may be asked to wear a hospital gown.  Inform your doctor if your pregnant or potentially pregnant because the radiation exposure from the radiotracer can be harmful to the baby.As such, bone scans aren't often performed on pregnant women or nursing mothers — the breast milk can become slightly radioactive and harm the baby also.   There are other imaging tests for bone that are safer for pregnant women, such as MRI studies and diagnostic ultrasound. Short-term osteoporosis is not uncommon with pregnant women who are malnourished because minerals are leached from their bones to provide for the growing baby.  Although you can eat and drink normally just prior to your bone scan, tell your doctor about the medications you're taking, as these may affect your test. For example, medicines that contain barium or bismuth affect bone scan test results, so you should avoid taking them for at least four days prior to your appointment.Bismuth is found in a variety of medicinal products, such as Pepto-Bismol, Kaopectate, Devrom and De-Nol. Bismuth and barium can cause areas of your body to look too light on bone scans  , The amount of radiotracer injected into your vein just prior to getting a bone scan is not very much, but it still produces radiation in your body for up to 3 days.Radiation increases the risk of healthy cells mutating into cancer cells, so make sure you weigh all the pros and cons with your doctor before getting a bone scan.   It's estimated that a bone scan exposes you to no more radiation than a conventional full-body x-ray does and less than half that of a CT scan.Drinking lots of water and fluids starting immediately after a bone scan for 48 hours can help to flush out any radioactive tracer left in your body.If you must have a bone scan while breastfeeding, pump and throw away your breast milk for two to three days so your baby isn't harmed.  Allergic reactions related to the radiotracer dye are rare, but they do happen and can be life threatening.In most cases the reaction is mild and causes some pain and inflammation at the injection site and a related skin rash. In severe cases, anaphylaxis is triggered and leads to a widespread allergic reaction causing swelling, breathing difficulty, hives and reduced blood pressure.   Call your doctor immediately if any signs of an allergic reaction become obvious once you get home after your appointment. The radioactive tracer takes between one to four hours to be absorbed by your bones, although most allergic reactions occur within 30 minutes of the injection.  There is a slight risk of infection or excessive bleeding when the needle is inserted into your vein to inject the radioactive dye.Infections usually take a couple of days to develop and include pain, redness and swelling at the injection site. Call your doctor immediately if you notice these signs. You may need to go on antibiotics to combat the infection.   Signs of a more significant infection include severe throbbing pain and pus drainage at the injection site, numbness and tingling in your involved arm, fatigue and a fever. Make sure the doctor or technician cleans your arm with an alcohol swab or wipe just prior to the injection.  

get a copy of your bone scan.  identify the bones in your scan.  get properly orientated.  determine the time frame.  look for "hot spots.",  look for "cold spots.",  understand the results.  remove jewelry and other metal objects.  tell your doctor if you are pregnant.  don't take any medicine containing bismuth.  understand the radiation risk.  watch for allergic reactions.  look out for potential infection. 

 Were those sparkly stilettos or that plasma TV really worth the number of hours you had to spend in a cubicle, or getting yelled at by your boss, or dealing with impossible clients, in order to pay for that purchase? What in your spending diary would you happily give up if it meant spending 8 hours a day doing something you actually enjoy doing? For example, you might not splurge on take-out and beer four times a week if you weren't so depressed and/or frustrated about your job.; , If you can't find the motivation to pursue your passion part-time, you'll never be able to push yourself and make it work full-time. Prove to yourself that this is really what you want to do, and test the waters without quitting your day job. Whether it means volunteering, getting a part-time job, taking an art course, or just locking yourself in your room with a guitar, a pencil, and a piece of paper, get down to business.   Take the leap once you're more confident about the likelihood of success. When the income you're bringing in from your passionate endeavors can reliably cover your living expenses, make the switch. Write that glorious resignation letter and become one of those people who wakes up and actually looks forward to going to work!  , Show people your work. Talk about it every chance you get. Ask for feedback. Start a website. Use social networking to promote what you do. Most importantly, learn not to take criticism personally. When you're passionate about something and others aren't so enthused, it's easy to feel like they've just told you your child is ugly. Remember that if you want to do what you love for a living, you have to offer the world something they want. That's the deal. Keep up your end of the bargain.   Have courage. Doing what you love is often a balance between producing what you know your clients want and being bold. With focus and determination, you can take some risks in trying out new ideas and approaches that are untested––just be sure to keep the things that you know do work running as well.  While you may have hated math in high school, tracking the flow of cash through your life might be the only way you can avoid selling your soul at a job you hate. Learn the difference between what you need (a roof over your head and the lights on) over what you want (this season's fashion trends) and apply this to all spending decisions. And while treats are not out of the question, they are not a regular indulgence when you're sticking to a budget (but that only makes them all the more special when you do treat yourself).   Draw up a weekly budget. Stay within the limits you've set yourself, as well as setting aside an amount for saving each week. Keep a spending diary––record each and every one of your purchases in a single notebook. You might be surprised at some of the frivolous purchases or at discovering where you could be cutting costs. Build your emergency fund. This is for unexpected things that happen in life, like the car ceasing to work or your computer dying. This must be earmarked for a specific purpose and cannot be dipped into for indulgences. It's a safety net both in reality and psychologically, that lets you have more wiggle room with your low pay.  In terms of your time off your passion, avoid activities that suck up money. There are plenty of free or cheap ways to enjoy yourself in your downtime and in many cases, these will probably enhance your creativity and enthusiasm for what you're doing. Make a list of the things you love to do that don't cost much, such as hiking, visiting the park, going to galleries, checking out the museums in your area, people-watching, having a long, slow coffee in a vibrant coffeehouse, reading books that take you out of your comfort zone, sitting on the beach, etc. And if you love to shop, try to shop as a way of gaining ideas rather than goods; turn yearning into learning by soaking up ideas for your next project from shop window inspirations, watching people's approaches to shopping to inspire your next novel or finding fascinating objects to snap for your photo collection.  There will be times when you feel some annoyance or disappointment that you can't have what some people do or that your status doesn't seem as "important" as someone with a high level title––it's only natural. And when this does happen, apart from not comparing yourself to others, look for all the good you have in your life as a result of your choice. Think of the non-monetary gains such as time, living up to your principles, having fun and giving the world your authentic self. If you're good at what you're doing, proud of it and enjoying it, you're living the way many people more cashed-up than you can only dream of.   Dreams matter but always be conscious that the dream must be broken into manageable actions that cross into reality and get achieved. Use the "dream" part of your dream job to stay enthused and motivated; the "job" part is all about the doing. Have a purpose larger than yourself. If you aim to make a meaningful contribution to the world and stay focused on helping others through your talents, whatever they may be, you'll make a positive dent on the universe. To do this, develop a vision that is something others can understand and that causes you to inspire others when you discuss it. The vision will help you through the leanest of times, as well as convincing others of the worthiness of what you're doing.  

review your priorities.  do what you love on the side.  sell the fruits of your labor.  learn to manage your money.  do things that cost nothing or very little.  remind yourself when it feels tough that it's not all about work. 

 It's best if your cat gets used to the crib before your baby is born. Try to set up the crib about a month before the birth and begin training your cat immediately. This way your cat will already be trained not to jump in the crib when your baby is ready to use it.Avoid making the crib really comfortable or your cat may want to nap in it.; , If you see your cat jump into the crib, firmly say "no" and take it out of the crib right away. Put the cat down in a place where it's allowed to be. Avoid yelling at the cat.   Don't punish your cat once you've removed it from the crib. It should go off to a place where it's allowed to be.  If your cat returns to jump in the crib or you find it in there later, say "no" and remove it from the crib. You'll need to remove your cat every time you find it in the crib so it associates jumping in the crib with being removed from the crib.   Avoid letting the cat nap in the crib or it will become confused about when the crib is off-limits.  Another way to startle your cat into avoiding the crib is to spray the cat with water or an unpleasant-tasting spray. Buy bitter apple spray from a pet store or fill a spray bottle with water. If you see the cat jump into the crib, immediately spray it with water or the scent. Your cat will become startled and will begin to associate jumping into the crib with being sprayed.   Some argue that spraying your cat is an effective way to prevent it from jumping in the crib, but others believe that it can damage the bond you have with your cat and increase its stress level. 

train your cat right away.  say "no" and remove your cat from the crib.  be consistent with your response.  spray your cat. 

; , Since Vietnamese is a tonal language, pronunciation is extremely important to the meaning of both words and phrases. When you’re hoping to say “thank you,” say “cảm” in a broken falling tone, and “ơn” in a flat tone.Since it is hard to imagine these sounds from simply reading about them, listen to recordings of the phrase online.When pronounced correctly, “cảm ơn” will sound like “gauhm uhhn”. The “auh” portion of the first word is sounded out in a rising, then falling voice.  Increase the politeness of your expression by including a personal pronoun corresponding with the person you are addressing. In other words, say, “cám ơn,” in addition to an appropriate word for “you” in Vietnamese. Use “bà,” pronounced “baa,” when addressing an older woman, and “cô,” pronounced “coh,” to address a young girl.Use “ông”, pronounced “ohng,” to address a man who is older than you, and “anh,” pronounced “ang,” when thanking a young man. For instance; “cám ơn cô” means “thank you,” as you would say it to a young woman.  Add “nhiều lắm,” pronounced “nyee-oh luhm,” after saying “cảm ơn” to express especially strong gratitude. This addition indicates the English equivalent of "a lot" or "so much.”Accordingly, say, “cảm ơn nhiều lắm,” pronounced “gauhm uhhn nyee-oh luhm,” if you’re hoping to more strongly convey your gratitude., The Vietnamese language includes another word to help express appreciation in contexts that requires extreme formality and politeness. In particular, the word “xin,” which translates to “to ask” or even “to beg” is placed before “cảm ơn.” Altogether, say “xin cảm ơn,” pronounced like “sin gauhm uhhn.”  

say “cảm ơn.” the nearest equivalent to the english phrase “thanks,” in vietnamese uses the words “cảm” and “ơn.” these two words together translate literally to the directive to “feel favor.” use “cảm ơn” when thanking someone informally.in english, the phrase “thank you” has the person you are addressing built in – “you.” in vietnamese, however, you’ll also need to add a word to indicate the person you are addressing.  pronounce “cảm ơn” correctly.  include a personal pronoun.  emphasize your gratitude.  say thank you as formally as possible. 

 One of the most effective ways you can help save whales is by joining an organization that is actively working to stop practices that harm whales. You can become a member of a conservation organization with a small donation. Students can usually join for a reduced fee.   Support an organization like the World Wildlife Fund or Greenpeace, which are both working to help save whales.  One of the most important ways you can help whale populations is with a continuing donation to a conservation organization. Instead of making a one-time gift, consider setting up a monthly donation in a smaller amount.Try making a monthly donation to a conservation organization like the Natural Resources Defense Council.  Some organizations allow individuals to make a symbolic whale adoption. For a donation to the organization, you can symbolically adopt a whale while donating cash to the cause. Many organizations will give you a personalized adoption certificate commemorating your adoption.Try adopting a whale through an organization like Defenders of Wildlife.  

join a conservation organization.  consider an ongoing monthly gift.  adopt a whale. 

 Your recommended daily calories depend on your age, size, and activity level. They also depend on whether you’re trying to lose weight, gain weight, or maintain your current weight.Use an online calculator to determine how many calories you should consume each day or read this wikiHow article, How to Calculate Your Total Daily Calorie Needs. You can also see a personal trainer or a nutritionist for an in-person consultation about how much you should be eating. Heart rate monitors can be worn to determine exactly how many calories you burn each day.; , Even if you don’t have a food scale or measuring cup, you can estimate your portions. A cup is about the size of the average person’s fist. A tablespoon is a little bigger than your thumb tip.Some things come packed in single servings. For example, you can buy single servings of yogurt, juice, or even frozen dinners. These items should have nutritional information per serving on the package. Remember to measure the amount you would normally eat. If you measure less than that, you won’t know whether you’re usually overeating or not.  Choose a day and eat as you normally would; however, write down everything you’ve eaten that day and how much of each item. Add up the calories and compare them to your recommended daily intake.Many online databases offer free calorie estimates for thousands of foods. Do your best to estimate. If you eat at restaurants, or if someone else does your cooking, you may need to guess at the calories; however, you can also ask the chef about ingredients and cooking methods. At a restaurant, you can say, “Do you know if this was sautéed in butter?” or “Was this fried?” if you’re not sure.  This will tell you if you are overeating. For example, if your recommended caloric intake is 1,800 calories per day, but you’re eating 2,200, you’re overeating by 400 calories.   You may want to calculate how much you eat for a few days and take an average. Only calculating for one day might not give you the most accurate results. Exercise will affect your results. For example, if one day you burn 500 calories exercising, you will be able to eat 500 extra calories without overeating.  

calculate your recommended daily caloric intake.  measure servings before eating.  calculate the amount of food you usually eat.  compare how much you eat to your recommended daily intake. 

 You will need: (at least)   Underwear (boxers, fitted boxers or briefs, your choice) and under shirts (muscle or t shirt). Make sure to purchase quality items that won't fade, stretch, or wear out. Three Pairs of Jeans, dark blue and light blue. Other colors like black, white and tan can fade in and out of style, but blue is classic. Also make sure to avoid pre-torn or destroyed jeans. Try buying jeans with a light distress or faded wash on the knee or thigh areas, but be careful. Two Pairs of Khakis. Make sure one is a more traditional color, such as British Khaki. The other can be a bit different, like grey, navy or Nantucket Red. There are many different kinds of cuts: straight leg, classic (more tapered) boot cut and loose. Try them all and find the fit and style you like. Three Casual Oxford Shirts: Make sure to have 2 solid colors (blue and white are both classic) and one striped oxford shirt. Four Polo Shirts. Stick to the classic colors: Navy, White, Black, Grey, Red, Yellow, Green. You can add more exotic colors later. Two Solid V-Neck Sweaters. These should be neutral colors (Navy, Tan, Black, Grey, White). One Casual Blazer. It can be two or three button, but two button jackets are more casual. Stick to solid colors; navy blue is best. Avoid patterns for now. One brown and one black belt. Brown loafers or Docksiders. Sperry Top-Siders are your best bet. Sneakers. Avoid very athletic looking sneakers or running shoes unless you are in a gym. Stick to simple casual sneakers. An example would be solid color canvas sneakers or simple leather sneakers. One or two bags in your wardrobe. Look for black and brown bags to start out. Olive colors can be incorporated as well. Messengers, totes, briefcases, and holdalls are always in so don't be afraid.; , You will need:   At least one good dress shirt. If you are starting a new job that requires dress shirts, then you will want to get five: two white, two blue, one French blue. One good pair of dress pants, 100% wool. Stick to Khaki, Charcoal or Navy. A more formal navy blazer or sport coat. Ties. These can really carry your wardrobe a long way; different ties can make the same suit look new. A good tie should be solid and versatile, 100% silk. There are so many ties to choose from, but in a formal setting, stick to solid color ties, simple striped ties, or subtle patterned ties. Avoid very seasonal ties, they are only good for a short amount of time. One good suit, either navy or charcoal, 100% year round wool, single breasted, 2 or 3 button Black Shoes and Belt Trench Coat or Overcoat, Khaki or charcoal. Black Tie attire (optional), Tuxedo with bow tie, cummerbund, and white shirt.  

start with building a basic, casual wardrobe.  once you have a casual wardrobe established, you may move onto the semi-formal and formal wardrobe. 

 Pour undiluted distilled white vinegar into a spray bottle.If your cabinets have a delicate finish, make a gentler vinegar cleaning solution by adding equal parts of vinegar and warm water to the spray bottle.If you don’t have a spray bottle at home, you can purchase one at most grocery stores, hardware stores, and general retailers. Vinegar is especially good at removing the sticky film sometimes left behind by hands. If you have small children who leave greasy handprints on your cabinets, use vinegar.; , Be thorough when misting. Coat all surfaces of the cabinets with a light layer of the vinegar solution. After applying the solution, allow it to sit for about 5 to 10 minutes.Do not oversaturate your cabinets with the solution. This can cause wood damage, peeling paint, or rusting metal., After the vinegar has had time to sit, mist the cabinets again in the same fashion as before.Then use a clean, soft dishcloth to scrub away built up grease and grime.  Severely dirty cabinets may require light buffing with a non-abrasive scrubbing pad. Lightly rub the scrubber in a circular motion over areas with stubborn grease.   Using abrasive cleaning tools may harm the finish or the surface of your cabinets. Test scrubbers on an out of sight part of the cabinet before using them., Use a clean, soft, lint-free cloth to wipe your cabinets dry. When the cabinets are dry, you should be able to see or feel any remaining greasiness. Repeat this process as necessary until your cabinets are grease free. 

create a vinegar solution.  mist your greasy cabinets with the vinegar solution.  re-wet the cabinets and wipe them clean.  use a gentle scrubber on stubborn areas.  dry the cleaned cabinets. 

 While you'll need to taste the spice differences and match the wines accordingly, as a general rule, look for fruitier, fresh, crisp and moderately aromatic wines to match spicy Asian dishes.The Rieslings and Traminers are a good choice.   Avoid oaky and buttery whites, or neutral and dry whites for the most part.Restaurant styles for Asian food include: Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewurztraminer, Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir, Merlot, and Italian varietals (such as Barbera and Sangiovese).; , Dishes redolent of lemongrass, orange, or other citrus flavours will often match well with a citrus-based Semillon, especially young ones. Try Chardonnay/Semillon and Sauvignon/Semillon blends as well. Riesling is a good choice for lemon-based sauces., The clean, pure, and fresh taste is a good match for these flavors.For Thai food, try dry but fruity wines to match the salty and sweet flavors.Sauvignons, Riesling and Semillons can work well, as can lightly chilled New World reds and Beaujolais-Villages., Most Chinese food tends to be delicate and slightly sweet, so the wine needs to be considerate of this. Suitable wines include Riesling, Champagne (demi-sec or brut) and New World Pinot Noirs., Japanese dishes can be difficult to match to a wine because of the wasabi, pickles, and dipping sauce flavors. Other flavors that might work include Chablis, firm, dry whites and if you must try a red, go for a Beaujolais., Most stir-fries carry heavier sauces and flavours and can handle a fuller bodied wine. Try well rounded Chardonnays.  Curries and thick sauce dishes might go well with such wines as Merlot and Shiraz.   Modern New World white wines are better able to cope with the bitter, sour, and astringent complexities found in curries and other Indian hot food than classic European wines.Pinot Gris is a good choice for richly flavored and textured Asian food, such as Vietnamese pork, or prawn rolls with a peanut sauce.Avoid heavy tannins and oak with hot Asian food and experiment with chilling the wine lightly before use., The ideas outlined in this article are suggestions and some may not work to your liking, while others may be spot on. It's a good idea to keep a notebook of the successes (and failures!) and rely on that to build up your knowledge of what matches work best.  

match wines to spicy asian dishes.  match citrus based wines to asian dishes with lemon and orange bases.  match riesling to the flavors of coriander and chillies.  try light wines with chinese food.  match riesling, dry champagne, and new zealand sparkling wines to japanese dishes.  match stir-fries with stronger wines.  match strong flavors with stronger wines.  experiment a lot and have a sense of adventure. 

 You can also choose to purchase them online if you do not need them right away.; , It is important that your car does not sink or roll away while resting on a jack or on jack stands.  If any of the wheels you will be working on has hubcaps, use a wrench or screwdriver to remove them.  It is important to remember to loosen, or break, the lug nuts before you jack up the vehicle. This way the weight of the vehicle is still on the wheels and it prevents them from spinning dangerously while you turn the lugs.  Once the lugs have been loosened, it will be necessary to jack the care up so that the wheels can be removed. As mentioned above, this should be done on level concrete or some other hard, level surface. Some important things to remember when jacking up the care are:   Your owner’s manual will recommend jacking points The most common way to elevate the car is a floor jack or trolley jack. You should use jack stands to stabilize the car. If you have access to a hydraulic lift it will save you time.  At this point, the lugs may be loose enough to remove by hand. If not, finish removing the lugs with the lug wrench or impact wrench. Once the lugs are removed, pull the wheel off of the wheelbase. Place wheels under the car as back-up protection in case the jack stands fail.  This cap will be in the center of the hub and can be removed by simply prying away from the hub. This will expose the retaining nut., There will be a pin in front of the retaining nut that prevents the nut from loosening (referred to as a cotter pin). Remove it by straightening the bent end of the pin and prying it out of its hole with pliers or a screwdriver., Using a wrench or ratchet, turn the nut counter-clockwise (to the left) to loosen it. If the nut is stuck lubricate it with WD-40 or similar lubricant.  Some drums have small bolts holding them to the hub. If this is the case you will need to remove those bolts. , Pull the drum straight off of the hub. You may have to wiggle a little to get it started. If the drum appears stuck and will not pull off, you should:   Check to make sure all bolts holding the drum to the hub are removed. Check to see if the drum is getting caught on the brake shoes., This step is only necessary if your drum is getting caught on the brake shoes. You will need to look on the back side of the backing plate (the steel plate on which the brake components are mounted) for a small rubber plug. Removing this plug will provide access to the brake shoe adjuster. Use a flat head screwdriver or a brake adjuster bar to retract the brake shoes.   The adjuster is designed to self-adjust the shoes into a tightened position, so loosening them may be tricky. If the drum gets harder to turn as you adjust, you are going in the wrong direction. Once the drum is removed you can continue.  These springs attach to the brake shoe and the shoe anchor and hold tension on the brake shoe. Once the brake pedal is released, they return the brake shoe to its original position. To remove them use the round, notched part of the brake spring pliers. Place the round part on the anchor pin (the nob that the springs are hooked to) and turn it until the notch catches the spring, and then twist and pull to remove the spring., To do this, lightly grip the outside of the retaining ring with pliers, push in, and twist until the ring comes off., At this point the shoe should easily pull away from the backing plate. There will be another spring attached at the bottom of the shoe, but it will no longer be tensioned so you can just slide it off of the shoe.  One of the brake shoes will be connected to an emergency brake line. To remove it, pull the spring cover back and slide the cable sideways away from the shoe., Fasten the emergency brake cable to the replacement brake shoe on the same side your removed it. Pull up the cover again and slide the cable into the proper slot on the shoe (it will look the same as the one you removed it from). ., You will need to transfer the return spring (at the top of the shoe) and the small emergency brake spring (near the center of the shoe). If your vehicle has any other hardware on the brake shoe, transfer it to the new one as well. ., You want to avoid squeaking and rubbing of the brake shoes. For this reason, you should grease any bare or rubbed spots on the backing plate. ., There will be a hook at the end of the spring and a slot in the bottom of the brake shoe. Hook the spring into that slot.  Now it is time to put the first brake shoe back into place. Once you get it lined up, hold it there until you can replace the retaining ring.  Put the spring that goes with the retaining ring in place over the small rod that protrudes from behind the brake shoe. Place the ring over the spring and press in and twist until the ring slides over the rod and locks into place.  Now it is time to begin installing the second brake shoe. Again, you are going to start with the bottom spring.  You will need to line it up with the adjusting spring lever.  Here you will use the flat end of your brake spring pliers to pry the spring into place and hook it at the top of the second brake shoe. This will connect the two brake shoes.  Follow the same procedure as you did with the first retaining ring. Place the spring first, then push and twist the ring into place.  This screw changes the position of the adjusting spring, which in turn changes the position of the brake shoes. Since the new shoes are thicker than the old ones, you will need to set the adjusting screw to account for that. Use one screwdriver to push the automatic adjuster assembly down and the other to twist the cog that loosens the adjuster.  Slide the drum back onto the hub. You will want to spin it and make sure that it has just a little drag. If the drum does not spin then your shoes are too tight and you need to loosen them (using the adjusting screw). If the drum spins freely with no drag at all then your shoes are too loose and you will need to tighten them (using the adjusting screw).  You may or may not have bolts to fasten your drum to the hub. If you do, they should be reinstalled now.  You want to tighten the retaining nut that holds the drum in place, and also put the cotter pin back through the hole to keep the nut from loosening.  The dust cap should push right back into place. Make sure that it is snapped back into place tightly.  You should slide the wheels back onto the wheelbase and thread the lug nuts on tight enough to hold wheels in place while the car is still on the jack stands.  Do this slowly and carefully. You do not want the vehicle to drop suddenly.  Once the weight is back on the wheels, use a lug wrench or impact wrench to tighten the lugs to the proper torque specifications in your service manual.  You should check your brake fluid and add more if needed anytime you do brake work.  Before you drive your car you want to be sure that your new brake shoes are working properly.  

purchase a quality pair of brake spring pliers at your local automobile supply store.  pull the car onto level, solid ground.  remove hubcaps from the wheels you will be working on.  loosen the lug nuts with a lug wrench (tire iron) or impact wrench.  jack up the car.  remove the wheels.  remove the grease dust cap.  pull out the cotter pin.  remove the retaining nut.  inspect the drum.  attempt remove the drum.  retract the brake shoes.  remove the return springs with your brake spring pliers.  remove the retaining rings that hold the brake shoes in place.  pull the brake shoe off.  remove the emergency brake line.  re-install the emergency brake cable.  remove any parts from the old brake shoes and transfer them to the new brake shoes.  grease the backing plate.  slide the bottom spring onto the new brake shoe.  slide the show into place against the backing plate.  replace the retaining ring for the first shoe.  slide the bottom spring onto the second brake shoe.  put the brake shoe into its proper place against the backing plate.  fasten the adjusting spring onto the second brake shoe.  replace the retaining ring for the second shoe.  use two screwdrivers to set the adjusting screw.  put the drum back on.  replace any bolts that hold the drum to the hub.  reinstall the retaining nut and cotter pin.  put the dust cap back on.  re-install the wheels.  remove the jack stands and lower the vehicle to the ground using the floor jack.  tighten the lugs to the specified torque.  add brake fluid if needed.  test the brake. 

 Let's say you're working with this one:   f(x) = ln(x-8)  , The natural log has to be a positive number, so set the terms inside the parentheses to greater than zero to make it so. Here's what you do:   x - 8 > 0  , Just isolate the variable x by adding 8 to both sides. Here's how:   x - 8 + 8 > 0 + 8 x > 8  , Show that the domain for this equation is equal to all numbers greater than 8 until infinity. Here's how:   D = (8,∞)  

write the problem.  set the terms inside the parentheses to greater than zero.  solve.  state the domain. 

 Teaching the fundamentals of letters (what a letter is, what each letter is called, and how it sounds) is where you should begin if you want to teach literacy effectively. Regardless of age level or language, literacy must begin with an understanding of letters. If you are teaching a language with a non-roman alphabet, the same principle applies: teach the characters first.   Teach your students how to recognize the different shapes of the letters. They will need to be able to easily differentiate between letter which look the same or letters which sound the same. Size variation is an important part of learning to write letters. Teach your students about capital letters and lowercase letters and when to use them. If teaching a non-roman alphabet, this will be less of a problem. Directionality is another important skill. Your students will need to know what direction letters face and how to properly place them next to each other. For roman lettering, this will be right to left and horizontal. For other languages it can also be left to right or vertical, depending on the region. Spacing is an important skill as well. Teach your students how to place space in between words, sentences, paragraphs, etc.; , Phonics is all about learning what sound letters make, how to identify those sounds, and how to work with them. Developing your students’ understanding of phonics will be key to teaching them to read and write.   Teach your students to hear. They need to be able to listen to speech and recognize that those words are composed of individual sounds. Once they grasp the concept of those sounds, teach them to identify the sounds. For example, your students will need to be able to hear an “aaaaahhhh” sound and know that it is written with an “a”. Once they are comfortable identifying sounds, you will also need to teach them how to manipulate sounds within words. They should be able to recognize when words rhyme or when one word out of a set begins or ends with a different sound than the others. They should be able to think of their own examples as well. Teach compound sounds as well. You will need to explain that when certain letters appear together, it changes how they sound. For example, in English the “th” or “sh”, in Spanish the “ll”, and in German the “ch” or “eu”.  Once your students have a solid grasp on letters and their associated sounds, you can move on to using those letters and sounds to form words. Read to them frequently at this stage, as well as writing lots of examples for them to look at. This will give them opportunities to see how words are formed.   An important part of teaching word formation is teaching your students the difference between vowels and consonants. Teach them which letters are which and explain the necessity of vowels within a word. Teach the basic principles regarding where in a word vowels can go. For example, it is very rare for the only vowel in a word to go at the very end of the word but quite common to have the second letter or sound of a word be a vowel.  You students will need to learn and understand sentence structure once they have mastered forming words. Sentence structure is the order in which words or parts of speech go, the sequences in which they are used. Understanding sentence structure will be necessary if they are to form written sentences which sound correct. Often people will have difficulty writing naturally like this, even if they speak correctly.   Your students should learn how to identify nouns. Teach them what a noun is and where it usually goes in a sentence. The easiest way to explain it will likely be the tried-and-true “person, place, thing or idea”. Your students will need to be able to identify verbs, too. Teach them about “action words” and give them lots of examples. You can have them act out different verbs in order to solidify the concept in their mind. Explain where verbs go in a sentence. Your students will need to be able to identify adjectives as well. Explain that adjectives describe other words. Teach them where these words go in a sentence and how they attach to other words.  Teaching proper grammar will be absolutely essential to your students’ learning to write sentences which can be understood and sound natural.   Using parts of speech together is an important concept in grammar. Your students should develop an understanding of how nouns, verbs and adjectives interact and how they fit together. Where these words go in a sentence and when they must be preceded or followed by another is also important to understand. Tense is a key concept to understanding how to form proper sentences. Your students should learn and practice creating sentences which take place in the past, present, and future. This will teach them how words must be changed in order to indicate time. This is a complex skill and is often not truly mastered until much later. Conjugation and declension are other important skills. Conjugation is how verbs change, depending on how they interact with the other words in the sentence. For example, in English we say “I jump” but we also say “she jumped”. Nouns can go through a similar process, called declension, but it is nonexistent in English. Though it has largely been removed from English, many other languages have case systems which your students will need to understand if they are learning one of those languages. Cases denote the different functions that nouns and pronouns can serve in a sentence and, at least in those languages with a case system, how the case changes the noun (generally with a shift in suffix).  A difficult skill to master, the use of proper punctuation will be vital to creating well constructed sentences. Later in life, proper punctuation is often seen as a mark of intelligence and education, so building your students’ skills in this area will be very important for opening up opportunities for them in the future.  

teach letters.  teach phonics.  teach the forming of words.  understand sentence structure.  teach proper grammar.  don’t forget punctuation. 

 You can use either liquid soap or bar soap. If using liquid soap, squirt a bit onto a sponge, then wipe the sponge across the surface of the door hinge. If using bar soap, apply the bar of soap directly to the hinge, especially the joints around which the hinge turns., Dab a clean paper towel in a tub of petroleum jelly. Remove the hinge pin from the door by placing the pointed end of a nail at the bottom of the door hinge, then tapping the nail gently upward with a hammer. The hinge pin will come out the top of the hinge. Wipe the hinge pin with the paper towel, then slide it back into the hinge., Light some paraffin candles. After an hour or so, remove the hinge pin on the squeaky hinge by placing the pointed end of a nail beneath the squeaky hinge, then tapping the nail gently upward with a hammer. Slide the hinge pin from the top of the hinge. Blow out the candle, then dip the hinge pin in the melted wax. After it’s well-covered in wax, slip it back into the hinge.You can wear rubber gloves during this process if you don’t want to get wax on your hands.  

rub soap on the door hinge.  smear petroleum jelly over the hinge pin.  coat the hinge pin with paraffin wax. 

 Identifying the type of broken car horn you have will help you decide how to approach the fix.  Many cars have 2 or more horns. If the sound of the horn is low when you press it, 1 or more of the horns has stopped working. , The horn should resemble a fuse with wires coming out of it. To remove the wire connector, press down on the lower end of the connector and then pull the wiring out. Remove the mounting bolt and the spade lugs, which are attached to the wiring. Clean the components and then reattach them. Ask your helper to honk the horn again.  You may choose to replace the broken horn with the exact horn originally installed in the car or you may choose a universal car horn.  Read your owner's manual to find the location of your car's fuse box. Your owner's manual will also inform you of the specific fuse connected to the operation of the car horn.; , You may also be able to remove the fuse with your fingers. Your fuse has failed if the metal strip inside it is broken.  You can purchase replacement fuses from an auto supply store. Install the appropriate fuse and then have your helper try the horn again.    A problem with the airbag can result in a malfunctioning horn. If the airbag has expanded, it may be interfering with the component called a clock spring that allows power to reach the horn button from the relay coil which connects to the horn itself.    If your airbag has expanded, a professional mechanic will need to remove and then properly reinstall the airbag. A mechanic can determine other possible issues with your horn if you have been unable to isolate the problem.  

determine the problem with your horn.  pop the hood and have someone press the horn if it is sounding at low volume.  locate the horn or horns on the radiator core support or behind the car's grille.  ,  remove the wire connector.  purchase a replacement horn if cleaning the horn parts does not fix your reduced sounding car horn.  check the fuse box if your horn will not make any sound.  remove the fuse with a pair of tweezers, needle-nosed pliers, or a pair of regular pliers.  replace the fuse if it is faulty.  check to see if the airbag light is illuminated on the dashboard if there is no problem with your fuse.  take your vehicle to a professional mechanic if the airbag light is illuminated.

 Aluminum is a common ingredient found in a lot of deodorants. It works by preventing perspiration from exiting through the sweat glands under your arms. Unfortunately, this also means the toxins that would naturally be excreted through your armpits are being blocked. Try an herbal or all-natural deodorant instead. Opt for organic natural products whenever possible.Herbal and crystal deodorants are especially popular. Even if it’s labeled “natural,” check the ingredients list before you by it.

If you are using screws or nails, position the picture so that the screw/nail hooks on to the hanging device on the back of the picture.  Place the level on top of the picture.

carefully position the artwork on the hanging implement of your choice.  use a level to determine whether or not your picture is hung straight. 

 A sound time-management strategy during tests is to answer the easy questions first. The idea is that you will quickly work through these questions, probably quicker than you had budgeted for, allowing you extra time to work on the more difficult sections.The issue with this strategy, versus working through every section as budgeted, is that you might skip a question thinking that it’s more difficult than it is. You also run the risk of not returning to questions that you’ve skipped.; , After you’ve answered the easy questions, focus your time on the questions that are worth the most points. It makes more sense to spend 10 minutes on 1 question worth 20 points than to spend 10 minutes on 10 questions worth only 1 point each. In other words, 20 points for one question is worth more time than 10 points for 10 questions.Your exam should clearly state the value or percentage of each question or section. If you’re unsure, ask your proctor.  Make sure that you wear a watch so that you can stick to your time budget. You won’t be able to bring a cell phone in the test with you, and there may not be a clock on the wall, so you’ll need to remember your own time piece., You’ve studied, you’ve practiced, you’ve read through the test, you’ve budgeted your time, and there is no reason to rush yourself. You might be feeling a little anxious or want to hurry up and get the test over with, but time management is about pacing yourself. So, pace yourself. Don’t rush, as you’ll run the risk of making a critical mistake, and stick to your game plan., After you complete a section, give yourself a few seconds to pause and breathe before you move on. This helps you pace yourself, allows you to make sure that you’re managing your time effectively, and helps you mentally move from one task to another., No matter how prepared you are for this test and how well you’ve planned to manage your time, something can go wrong. This isn’t the end of the world, though, and shouldn’t derail your schedule at all. Plan for some problems, and be ready for any issues.Bring at least two pens or pencils with you. If you’re allowed to use a calculator, bring spare batteries. Bring an extra blue book or paper. You might even pack a little emergency kit with throat lozenges, gum, a bandage, and lip balm.  Whether you’re taking a standardized test or a classroom examination, you will likely be able to find out the format of the test beforehand. Knowing the test’s format will help you study, as well as give you ideas about how to approach the materials.If you’re told that there will be three essay questions, for example, that will ask you to connect the larger theme of the course to specific texts that you’ve read in the class, you know to begin thinking about thesis statements. Or if your instructor says that there will be 15 multiple choice questions and 15 true/false questions, you understand that your focus should be much more specific, probably focusing on facts and dates.  If you’re taking a standardized test such as the GRE or the SAT, there are plenty of study guides available. Almost every current study guide will have practice tests, study materials, and approaches to taking the test. Typically these guides offer simulated exams as well, so that you can simulate the examination and your performance.Your school or local library may have study guides available for use within the library. You might find used copies of these guides online for a dramatically reduced price.  Practice answering essay questions well before your test if you have a good source of feedback available, such as a writing center or your professor has agreed to look over your essays for you. Doing so will show you what part of your essay writing you need to develop, as well as help you get comfortable answering a question in prose. The more you practice, the more efficient and quick you will become.Your instructor might give you example essay questions if you ask for them. These might include questions from previous exams or simply questions that they think would serve as good practice. Do no assume that your institution’s writing center or your professor will look over practice essays for you. Instead, respectfully ask if they are willing to review your practice essays and offer feedback.  Devote extra study time to working on your weakest areas. This will help you out in a few ways. You’ll be better prepared for material that isn’t your strong suit, and you’ll also spend much less time worrying about the information when you encounter it on the exam. Additionally, by studying your weakest areas, you’ll develop strategies for handling the material efficiently and quickly.A good example is the GRE’s verbal portion of the examination. Many people find this component especially challenging and devote extra time to studying flash cards, as well as developing strategies for word meanings, antonyms, and synonyms.  Create a study schedule that is realistic and is one to which you will commit. This ensures that you’re devoting enough time to studying, and also establishes a pattern for you, which will help you manage your time when you get into the actual examination.There are free study calendar templates available for download from the internet. Some printed student calendars also have a study schedule feature built in to the calendar itself.  When you receive the test, carefully read through every question before you even pick up your pen. Reading through the test allows you to find important information that might be tucked away in the exam, as well as figure out which questions you want to answer if you’re given a choice (choose one of the following three questions, for example).Reading through the test also shows you the exact format of the exam, which allows you to solidify your game plan.  You’ve read through the test and now know how the test is organized. Give yourself a minute to divide the test into its smaller parts, and decide how much time you’ll allow yourself on each section. Generally speaking, you want to allow more time for essay questions than anything else.True/false and multiple choice questions will take the least time to answer. At the most give yourself one minute per question, although 30 seconds is probably more realistic. Allow at least half of the allotted test time for any essay questions. Budget a few minutes to review your answers before submitting the test. You’d hate to turn in the test only to find out that your were one slot off on your Scan-tron sheet.  You’ve read every question and come up with a realistic budget on how you’ll spend your time. Now you need to decide how you’ll tackle the test. You might want to begin with any essay questions first, as writing answers out by hand tends to take longer than simply circling a correct answer. On the other hand, you might want to handle the fill-in-the blank portion first because they require the most recall skills.Because you have been practicing, you should generally have an idea of your strategy before you arrive to take the exam. If you’re taking a standardized test, the study guides that you use will guide you through the exact strategy that you should use to maximize your time management.  

answer the easy questions first.  focus on a question’s worth.  keep an eye on the clock.  don’t rush yourself.  take a breath or two.  prepare for the unexpected.  find out the test’s format.  get a study guide.  practice your essays.  review your weakest points.  develop a study schedule.  read every question.  create a budget.  strategize your approach. 

 Understand that bee pollen only makes up a fraction of a percent of an average sample of raw honey.Ensure that you are consuming a more sufficient amount of bee pollen each day by taking bee pollen directly instead. At the same time, eliminate the risk of dosing yourself with more than you intended, which may happen with raw honey.Although the amount of bee pollen in honey may not be effective in combating allergy symptoms, thyme honey has proven to be effective against them thanks to other ingredients.Combining processed thyme honey with local bee pollen may allow you to fight symptoms in general while building a stronger immunity to specific pollens. Do not consume bee pollen if you know that you are allergic to bee stings or if you have suffered anaphylactic shock in the past. Consult your doctor about using bee pollen if you are pregnant, nursing, or using blood thinners.  Visit a natural food store or farmer's market to find bee pollen from a local source. Make sure that you are going to be consuming pollen that is found in your area, thus containing those pollens that you are allergic to. Failing a local source, purchase a bee pollen that features a wide array of colors. This indicates a wider variety of pollen types, increasing the chances that it includes the one you need.Bee pollen is available as a liquid, pill, or powder; however, best results are often found with bee pollen that hasn’t been processed., Before you begin taking daily doses, test your current sensitivity to the pollen’s ingredients. Place a very small dab of liquid, powder, or granules on the tip of your tongue and then close your mouth. Hold it there for two minutes. As long as you experience no allergy symptoms, swallow the measure. Wait another 24 hours before beginning your daily regime, just in case any delayed reactions manifest.Discontinue use if you suffer an allergic reaction to such a little amount.  Start off with small daily doses of a half-teaspoon or even less. Pay close attention to your body to spot allergic reactions if and when they occur. As long as you are clear, slowly increase your intake over a four-week schedule, with the aim of consuming 1 to 3 tablespoons (14.8 to 44.4 ml) each day afterward.Be careful not to rush the process. If a larger amount causes allergy symptoms, cut back to an amount that proved safe and stick with that for a while before attempting another increase.  

control your daily intake.  buy local products.  test your tolerance.  work your way up. 

 The Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver (Form I-601A) allows certain immigrants who have overstayed their visas to stay in the US until a final determination is made with respect to their continued presence in the US. There are a long list of requirements determining who is eligible to file Form I-601A, but there are a few basic qualifications that will eliminate many undocumented aliens right off the bat. In order to file Form I-601A, you must:Be seventeen or older. Be in the United States. You must not have ANY other applications of any kind pending before the State Department, and there must not be any removal proceedings against you in progress.; , In order to be approved for a Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver, you must fall into one of four strictly defined categories:Your qualifying relative has filed Family Petition (Form I-130), on your behalf.  If your relative is a US citizen, you will be eligible if you are their spouse, child, parent, brother or sister. If your relative is a lawful permanent resident and not a citizen, you are only eligible if you are the spouse or unmarried child of your relative.   Your employer has filed From I-140 on your behalf. Form I-140 is a lengthy form which costs $580 to file. If your employer has submitted it, they would know. Just ask them. Alternatively, if you are a winner of the Diversity Visa lottery or the spouse or child of a winner, you are eligible for a Provisional Waiver.  By far, the majority of people eligible for a Provisional Waiver are the immigrant relatives of citizens or the immigrant relatives of lawful permanent residents. Since the Provisional Waiver is only stays a deportation temporarily, the applicant must show that their sponsoring relative would face hardship as a result of their absence. Hardship is interpreted broadly, and can include:Health hardships, including the cost of care or the availability of care if your relative had to accompany back to your home country. Financial hardships, including the loss of home, decline in standard of living, or loss of business. Educational hardships, including the disruption of current schooling, loss of opportunity for higher education, or a decline in the quality of education. Personal factors, such as separation from a spouse, child, or parent, and the presence of a large proportion of relatives in the US.  In order to qualify for a Provisional Waiver, you must have been in the US unlawfully for at least 180 days during a single stay. That means each time you leave the US, the count resets to zero, not starting again till you re-enter. 

check the basic qualifications.  determine which visa category you fall into.  demonstrate hardship.  make sure you meet the time requirements. 

 Diesels do not use spark plugs (like gasoline engines) as diesels rely purely on compression to ignite fuel. The more compressed the gas is, the hotter it is and the hotter the engine, the easier it is for diesel to ignite.Glow plugs are used to provide heat for the diesel engine and are powered by the battery. When it's very warm outside, their role isn't very important but when the temperature is cold, they are vital.  

replace the glow plugs. 

 Paragon has been released to play on two different consoles, PS4 or PC. Download the game on your platform of choice.   For the PS4 edition, you will have to download Paragon through the PSN store. For the PC edition, you will have to first download the EPIC Games launcher through the Paragon website. Then within the launcher itself there will be an option for you to download Paragon.; , To start playing you must make an account with EPIC Games or have a PSN ID.   You can either go to Epic Games directly and sign up, or to the Paragon Website. They both have links in the upper right hand corner that you can use to register. For PS4 once you download the game through the PSN Store, your account will be linked to your PSN ID. Surprise though! If you’d like you can link both your Epic Games account and your PSN, and you’ll be able to link accounts to use them on both PlayStation and PC.  For those who aren’t used to the MOBA genre, or those who just want to test out characters, playing by yourself is one of the best options. You can get a feel for a game and the way the map works, as well as the abilities of the character you’d like to use.   Remember making mistakes are okay with A; it’s just you and the computers. If you decide you’d rather explore the map to get a feel, that's okay What you do in this mode may not be okay to do in other game modes; being with you and only you takes a multiplayer experience and turns it singular. When you start playing with others for real, it’ll become a team game.  Though you are still playing with AI in this game mode, this is for players who are starting to feel more comfortable with themselves and are ready to play in a team setting with real people online to defeat an enemy team made of AI. Play this game mode if you're feeling ready to communicate and play with others, or if you're feeling like making others frustrated with the lack of understanding of mechanics.  So you’ve trained yourself, and you’ve trained with others, now it’s time to not only play with others, but fight against them too. Nothing changes between this game mode and the other ones besides the fact you are going to be expected to know how to play the game, and how the mechanics work, as well as communicate with your teammates, and understand that humans are a lot harder to face than AI.  Choosing the role you like is important; there are 5 main roles in Paragon.    Carries - Farming farming farming. The goal of a carry is to not die, and to carry the team late game. Most of their damage comes from their basic attacks, and they usually stick in the safe lane  Offlane - Heroes that can play well solo. They have a lot of survivability and movement abilities, and are a big threat to the other team's experience early game.  Jungler - Heroes that gain exp and card exp from killing neutral minions in the jungle, or the spaces in between in each lane. Taking buffs is the way, and ganking lanes is their game.  Support - Heroes that can help in team fights and assistant heroes. They usually stick to the carry and help them get to late game. Starting in safe lane like the carry, their number one goal is to keep their carry alive.  Midlaner - Heroes that have heavy ability damaging moves, mages, and those with large boosts. Their auto attacks are usually weak but they pack a punch with their abilities.  Paragon currently has 28 heroes available, with more being released at a rate of one every 3 weeks. There is a type for everybody: Supports, Carries, Midlaners, Offlaners, and Junglers, as well as melee heroes and ranged heroes. Picking heroes depends on your knowledge of the game.   Difficulties range from Easy, Advance, Intermediate, to Expert. Heroes are categorized by their Basic Attack Power, Ability Power, Durability, and Mobility. They are also often categorized by their traits, which are not a hard set of rules, but a guideline for those are beginning; Assassin’s, Attackers, Burst, Controllers, Durable, Elusive, Ganker, Guardian, Initiator, Marauder, Sieger, Wild, and Zoners.  Now that you know the roles and the heroes you can choose you can get to know the abilities of the heroes you want to play.   Each hero has 4 abilities three basic and one ultimate, and you assign ability points to every time you level up. Putting the points into the abilities make them stronger, basic abilities can be upgraded 3 times for a total of 4 levels, and ultimates can be leveled up two times for a total of three. Some abilities are passive; others are active it depends on the heroes. Some abilities are toggle-able, targeted, or area.  Decks are the type of cards you bring into a match that can be purchased in game with card points that can buy equipment, upgrade abilities, and the prime helix. You can have 40 cards in a deck.   You can buy cards with reputation through the home screen Leveling heroes and your account can give you cards Community events Weekly quests  , In game with the deck you bring into the game, you will be able to purchase the cards you have put into your deck with card points that you gain from card experience.    Equipment Cards - Equipment cards simply put are your items. There are 6 slots for equipment cards, and you may upgrade equipment cards with upgrade cards. Most equipment cards have 3 upgrade slots.   Passive - Passive slots for equipment cards are two. These type of cards do not have an active ability assigned to them.  Active - Paragon’s active cards are cards that have an active ability (e.g. a health potion card that heals you). Each hero has 4 active slots to put active cards in.    Upgrade - These are cards that have specific stats and can only upgrade equipment cards with that stat.  Prime Helix - These cards activate for the entire ally team giving them a strong buff; they are activated by destroying the Prime Helix Guardian in the Jungle. The prime helix is the strongest neutral creep in the game.  Lanes are important in Paragon. Your choosing a lane all depends on the role of the hero you chose, as each lane is slightly different from one another. Some heroes don't even play in lanes; they kill neutral minions in the jungle.    Midlane - This is usually a solo lane, and the lane where your mages and ability carries go, or heroes who use primarily strong abilities to harass the enemy .        Offlane or the left lane - This lane is primarily for the heroes that are able to do well on their own. This lane is shorter than the safe lane, and can be harder to farm close to you tower in comparison.        Safelane or the right lane - This is usually a two-person lane that inhabits the carry and the support class. The lane is ideal for farming close to your tower, or for hard pressuring your opponent and taking their tower.        The Jungle - The jungle is where heroes who are built to farm neutral minions go. You farm camps, and within camps you gain different type of buffs from different coloured camps, each colour having a buff associated with it, and different effects with that buff.  Experience is essential and important to you in the world of Paragon. It helps you level up abilities, and also allows you to gain card points so you can buy cards, to buy equipment, upgrade it, and so on.   Card Experience - Card experience of CXP is used by you to gain card points that allow for the purchase of cards. It is given from killing minions, structures, as well as the amber link.  Hero Experience - Hero experience or XP is used to raised Hero Level, which allows you to upgrade abilities and so on. There are give ways to gain normal experience: killing a hero, assisting in killing a hero, killing/being around a minion death, destroying structures, as well as neutral monsters within the jungle.  Amber Links - This is a mechanism in game that generates CXP every time an ally kills a white minion or a green guardian. Amber links are emptied every 2 minutes and each team member equally gains the experience. The enemy can steal CXP from it.  Killing the enemy is the most important step to Paragon. If you're not killing enemy minions, and getting experience from them, you will be killing enemy heroes. Killing enemy heroes will give you the most experience, and can determine how hard you can push into their base, as well as if you will win the game or not.  Though farming and killing heroes is important, destroying structures is the only true way you can win. With certain structures destroyed, you can force your way into enemy territory as well as avoid more damage, or even allow you to gain special ‘super minions’ to help your team.    Towers - There are two towers in each lane. They attack minions of the opposing team, and can do a considerable amount of damage to you and your team. Towers are essential to destroy as they give experience, card power, as well as pushes the lane and their destruction are key to victory.  Inhibitors - Inhibitors are the last protection before the core can be destroyed, they produce minions, consisting of ranged melee and siege. There are three of them per team, and if they're destroyed, your team will gain a “super minion” they have higher health and cause more damage.  The Core - The primary objective in the map; you cannot target it until one of the inhibitors on the enemies side is destroyed. With the destruction of the core, your team wins.  The final key for you to play Paragon well is to play with your team. Listening and working together can be beneficial for all. Don’t expect others to know what you are thinking, or understand your strategy; you have to tell them, Paragon is a team/online game and to get the most out of it you need to work together. 

pick your platform and install.  make your account.  play alone to start with.  play with a team.  play against others.  choose a role.  pick your hero.  get to know the hero's abilities.  build a deck.  use cards.  pick a lane.  get experience.  kill the enemy.  destroy their structures.  work with your team. 

 Turn on soothing music, grab a glass of wine (or anything else if you're too young), and put lots of bubbles in the bath. Stay in 20-30 minutes, or as long as you please.; , The best thing would be sweats and a T-shirt.  Stretching relieves all tension and relaxes you. Stretch for about 10 minutes.  Turn on some relaxing music and do some simple yoga in your house. Look up poses you can do. If you have Wii-fit, do all- or at least some- of the yoga poses. Do yoga for at least thirty minutes. When you're done, don't forget the best part- the relaxation part. The relaxation is just lying down on your back with quiet music and relaxing all your muscles and not stressing or thinking. Relax 5 minutes for every 30 minutes of yoga.  Sit down in a quiet spot and meditate. If you've never meditated before, start by doing 10 minutes. Next time you do it add 5 minutes until you're doing it for one hour at a time.  Don't take like a two-hour nap though. Take a 15 minute power nap. Close the blinds, and get in bed. Set an alarm for 15 minutes from then so you won't keep checking the clock or worrying about falling asleep and staying asleep for 3 hours.  Read a great book (don't read a scary book right now) on the couch with a blanket. Drink water or tea while reading.  You can either do something sweet like ice cream as a treat, or something healthy like fruit to make you feel better. Either way, grab it and your favorite drink. Eat it while doing the next step.  Dim the lights, relax on the couch with a blanket, and eat your snack. Watch a chick flick or a comedy, or your favorite movie. Just don't watch a horror movie. It needs to be relaxing.  If it's not night take the rest of the day easy. Here's ideas for if it's not night.   Take a walk. Not a jog or run. Just a relaxing walk to enjoy nature. Draw. Draw anything you want to, even if you're bad at drawing. Play an instrument. Try playing your guitar, piano, or flute, something like that. Don't start playing hard loud music.

 If you want to use other chip brands that come in a can, just make sure it is reflective inside and fairly similar to the Pringles version.; , The chips won't do anything for your camera hardware.  Trace it onto the can. You want to be sure that it is actually going to be a little undersized. You can't put the material you just cut off back on. It is better to work up to the correct size for your flash.  Remember, you are cutting it smaller than you will need so it is okay if your cuts are a little crooked. You will be slowly paring it down and straighter.  Here, it is not quite the right size.  Here it is paired with a set of extension tubes and a reversing ring used with a 50mm prime lens (an old one).  Like before, it doesn't need to be exact, but you will want to cut it out longer than you want. To ensure that the angle remains consistent, use some kind of straight edge.  As with the flash, do it piecemeal. Much easier to be more precise if you don't try to do it all in one cut. , If you have something sturdy and translucent, you can fasten it to the inside of the can. If you don't, try something else. In this picture, you see a Walmart bag 'donation'. The scrunchy was just the right size to hold it on securely.  Make any alterations that you need to.  

get your pringles can.  be sure to clean out your can first.  take your flash that you will be using and estimate the size of hole you will need for it.  start cutting it out.  keep trimming away at it until you got it right.  once, you have the correct size cut out, put your flash on your camera, as well as the setup you plan to use it with.  determine the best angle that you desire and mark it on the can.  start cutting away the bottom.  continue until you think you have the right angle and try it out on your macro setup.  ,  find something to use as the diffuser.  try it out. 

 Sometimes people will clean out their attics and basements and realize they never disposed of their outdated computer models. ,   Review classified ads in local newspapers and online to learn of the dates and times that garage sales, yard sales, estate sales, and flea markets will occur.  

search for vintage computers at garage sales, yard sales, and estate sales.  visit flea markets to look for vintage computers.  ,  determine when sales events will take place in your area. 

 Whenever a customer makes an order you will collect their email address so it's important to keep a good and safe register of your customers' contact details. In addition to this, you should make it possible for potential customers to easily register with your website using their email address even if they don't buy anything this time.   A register of users is a very useful resource for marketing and surveying your customer base and should be treated as such. You need to guarantee that your customers' personal and financial details submitted through your website are kept secure., A regular email to all your registered customers can be a very effective way to promote specific products or time-limited special offers. It's important to exercise careful judgement when sending out unsolicited communications to your customers, as nothing will turn people off as much as spam.You should tightly control your email newsletters, and only send out messages when you have something important to promote. Too frequent emails will be annoying, but too few will mean that they might forget about your store. Ensure that the email is well-crafted and matches the visual theme of your website and branding.  Increase your presence and brand-awareness by getting involved in online discussion groups around relevant topics to your store. For example, if you sell specialist teas you can contribute to forums for tea lovers and enthusiasts. But be sure to tread lightly when you do this. Don't engage in any hard selling or explicit advertising as it will not go down well.Keep your online store's URL in your signature, but don't over-promote your business. Don't just think of it advertising, but connecting with potential customers. It could give you ideas for new product lines or avenues to explore.  Keep a close eye on any feedback you receive on review websites as well as in direct contact with customers. It's important to know what people are saying and what the perception of your company is.If appropriate, respond politely to feedback and try to resolve any issue quickly and amicably. With social media it's possible for a minor problem to quickly escalate and gain you unwanted publicity.  

maintain a register of customers.  send a regular email newsletter.  be active in relevant online discussions.  follow your feedback. 

 A book with pages like a bible is a good choice for this purpose. A book printed on rice paper is the best option., The ink may add unwanted chemicals to your smoking experience.  Cut a small rectangle approximately 2 inches long by 1 ½ inches wide.  Make a crease in the center of the paper to hold your smoking material in the center of a “V” shape., Place a small amount of crumpled smoking material in the V of the fold.  Create a rolled cigarette by pinching the paper in the middle and roll it between your fingers.Roll the material towards one end of the paper and wrap the paper around the smoking material.  Use your saliva as a glue to stick the paper to itself.Seal the ends of the cigarette by twisting the paper gently to keep the smoking material from falling out.  Breathe in slowly as you light the end to get the paper and smoking material to begin to burn.  

get a book with very thin paper.  tear out a page with a small amount of printing on it.  cut a rectangle from the page.  fold the paper in half lengthwise.  add smoking material to the paper.  roll the paper between your thumbs and index finger.  lick the end of the paper gently to seal the cigarette.  light one end while inhaling from the other end. 

 You would never want someone to apologize to you if you were in the middle of watching a movie, much less cramming the night before a big exam. Rather, you should bide your time (within reason, mind you) and wait for an opportunity where the girl is free and relatively relaxed.   Again, you won't want to wait too long before going in for your apology. If you wait too long, it may be considered by the girl as a conscious decision on your part not to apologize.  The way you approach a girl to apologize in person will have a big influence on whether or not the apology is accepted. Approach her quietly and calmly. Don't let yourself be distracted by anything else; your apology should have your whole attention. As you approach, make sure to make steady eye contact. Don't smile too much or act too loosely; you want to tell her with your body language that you acknowledge the seriousness of the situation.   The question of approach is easier if you are apologizing over a text message or the phone, though you should keep in mind that an apology will only be at its most effective and affirmative if it's done in person. If you're not in a position where you'll be able to run into her easily, ask her to meet up. Keep your invitation simple and to the point, but give her reason to believe the reason you're meeting is to give you a chance to apologize. If she's too angry at the moment, give her some time; hopefully she'll come around and give you an opportunity to fess up.  Before you go into anything else, you should let her know from the start that you're sorry. If you try to explain why you're sorry before she actually knows you're apologizing, she may interpret it as an invitation to argue. Once you've approached her, take no time to let her know you're sorry. Any explaining can wait until after you've made the basic point. Being straightforward sounds easy on paper, but when there are emotions flaring up from both sides, it can be hard to see it through all the way. Don't let yourself get too worked up over it; if need be, remind yourself that this is a step in a process towards reclaiming your connection.   Your apology need not be elaborate; in fact, it's probably best that you keep it in as simple terms as possible. No need to be poetic or calculated here; just say "I'm sorry." The more complicated you get, the higher chance there will be that the apology will be misconstrued as something else.  Something as simple as "I'm sorry" will go a farther ways than you think, but it won't be enough for the more serious things. Once you've opened up the conversation like that, it's time to go into greater details as to why you are sorry and how you understand the way she's feeling. If it develops into a more balanced conversation and the blame wasn't one-sided, you might take the opportunity to express some of your own feelings as part of the healing process, but only once you know the apology's been accepted.For example, as a general template, you might say: "I'm really sorry for what I did. I was being really selfish at the time, and the way I see it's affected you has made me realize just how bad it was. I know I can't undo what happened, but I want you to know that I wish I could take it back, and I won't let it happen again."  , Petty grievances probably aren't worth fussing over too much but more serious issues will probably beget a response to your apology. Once you've laid your cards all on the table, it may come time for her to tell you how she feels. Look her in the eyes, remain calm whatever you do, and process everything she says. Even if what she says makes you angry, try to empathize with her; she may still be feeling angry from what happened, and this may colour the way she reacts towards you in a less-than-pleasant manner., Regardless of the specific type of relationship you're in, a hug is almost always appropriate. Hugging at the end of your apology will give the woman a physical show of how you feel, and her acceptance of your hug will offer some closure to the both of you.  An apology is just words if it isn't taken to heart. If you are apologizing for something you did, work on preventing it in the future. Doing things to fix the problem at hand has two benefits; first, it will practically reduce the chances of the situation happening again, and second, she will see you putting your apology into tangible actions. If you make a habit of rinsing yourself of apologies once you make them, you'll have a much harder time getting your apologies accepted in the future.For instance, if you are apologizing for being late all the time, set your alarm ten minutes earlier than you usually do. This will make your actions more prompt, thus reducing the risk of being late again. Letting the girl know the steps you've taken will prove to her that your apology was sincere. 

wait for the right time to apologize.the art of apologizing has partly to do with the right timing.  approach her solemnly.  tell her you're sorry.  express empathy.  allow her a chance to respond.  hug her.a verbal apology is often best accompanied by some sort of physical affirmation.  take steps to prevent future incidents. 

 No one can plan for every potential problem that might arise.The important thing is that you understand that you have the ability to problem solve in the moment. Part of this is accepting that problems will arise. Going with the flow is having the confidence that you'll be able to handle the unexpected.   A presentation at work that relies heavily on Powerpoint might get derailed because the projector breaks down or a file won't open. A person planning a party might have a good idea of how many people are going to show up, but must also be prepared for that number to be more or less than anticipated and adjust accordingly in the moment. A teacher with a well thought out lesson plan must always be ready to answer questions they did not anticipate. Don't be afraid to ask for help if you find yourself in a situation where you don't know how to proceed. For example you might ask if anyone in the meeting knows how to fix the projector. Or you might see if anyone at the party wouldn’t mind running out for more snacks if you find that you are running low. See the humor in a situation that has turned out completely different than you expected. Say you wore a suit to a party where everyone else is dressed much more casually. This can be embarrassing, but a person who knows how to go with the flow understands that it is also not the end of the world. Using humor can lighten a stressful situation. "I'm just trying to class this place up." "I have a movie premier to get to after the party."; , Going with the flow means sometimes giving up control, not only of the situation, but of other people. A situation might become more stressful because of the behavior of another person. Perhaps someone is late to a dinner outing and you have to wait for them to arrive before ordering. You may be at a party where someone is monopolizing the conversation, which is leading you to become frustrated. Remember that in situations like this you can’t control someone else, but you can control your own actions.Try to empathize with the other person. Why might they be acting the way they are acting? Give them the benefit of the doubt. Most people are just trying to do their best to be happy. The person might not know that their behavior is being perceived as disruptive.  Walk or drive a new way home from work without planning it ahead of time. Go to a new place for lunch. Order something you’re not sure you will like. Start a conversation with someone at school or at work that you don’t know very well. The more comfortable you get at putting yourself in situations that are unpredictable, the more easily you will be able to go with the flow no matter where you are.  We may set up an idea of how we want things to go, but rarely do they work out exactly that way. Striving for perfection is striving for something that does not exist.You don't need to completely let go of your goals for a project or outing, just be sure to make room for the fact that things don't always happen precisely the way you would like them to.   Focus more on the experience than the outcome. Whether you are cooking a new meal for the first time or attending a dance class, expecting that you’ll get it perfect the first time is only going to distract you from the joy of learning how to do something new. Instead, focus on the method and the joy of each moment, rather than obsessing about the outcome. Avoid seeing yourself as a set of accomplishments. The things we achieve in life can give us confidence and make us feel good, but it becomes dangerous when we lean too much on them for all our happiness. Think about the other things that give you joy like a sport you play, a hobby you have, or a friendship or relationship you cherish.  Putting things into perspective can be a great tool for helping you go with the flow. When you find yourself in a situation where a loss of control is becoming stressful, take a step back and ask yourself what the actual consequences will be if things don’t work out the way you originally wanted them too.   If you and some friends planned on seeing a movie only to discover it is sold out when you get to the theater, what is the harm of agreeing to see something else that you may not be as excited about? There is always the possibility that you might like the movie even if you don’t think you will and even if you don’t, you’ll still get to hangout with your friends.  Being surprised can be one of the best parts of life. When you are struggling to go with the flow, ask yourself what new things you may learn or experience by letting go of control.Embracing a last minute change of plans can be rewarding. The restaurant you planned to go to is too crowded? Great! This may force you to try a place you would have never gone to otherwise. Your favorite seat in the lunchroom is taken? Look at this as an opportunity to sit next to someone you don’t know very well and get to know them better. Maybe your boss gives you an assignment you weren’t expecting. This is a great opportunity to expand your role at work and to show how adaptable you can be.  It can be difficult to go with the flow if you are feeling overwhelmed or anxious. Practicing some deep breathing techniques can help settle your nerves and clear your mind. Try shifting your focus to your breathing for a few minutes. Count your breaths up to seven and then back down again. Do this several times until you start to feel calm again., Dwelling on things you could have or should have done in the past will only make it more difficult for you to enjoy what is actually happening in your present. Accept that what is happening in this moment is your reality and that beating yourself or spending your time searching for someone to blame is not going to change anything. Instead, focus on what feels good about the moment. “I’m still able to spend time with my family, even though the Thanksgiving turkey is burned.” Remember that you may not be able to change your surroundings or your situation, but you do have control over how you react to them., Maybe you taught a class where you feel like the lesson wasn’t communicated as efficiently as it could have been. Remember that you’ve also taught other successful classes and that you still have the ability to learn and grow.   Avoid “if only” statements.If you catch yourself saying things like “If only I had stayed at home,” or “If only I had planned my night more thoroughly,” stop yourself immediately. This type of thinking will only pull you out of the moment and make you feel worse.  Keeping a journal is a really helpful way to keep track of situations where it might be difficult for you to go with the flow. Write down what it is about those moments when you feel like you need to be in control and what makes those moments so difficult for you. You can also write down times when you found going with the flow to be easier than usual. What is similar or different about those moments?, Be open to the idea that someone else can take control of the situation if need be, and that they might be able to do just as good a job as you when it comes to leading everyone through something like rain on a wedding day, a lost dinner reservation, or a boring board game night. This will not only help you feel like you can more easily go with the flow, it will take some of the pressure off of you. Don’t make yourself responsible for every decision that needs to be made. Let someone else choose where to go dancing on Saturday night and be okay with whatever comes of it. If you are working on a group project be sure to get input from everyone involved. Don’t put yourself in charge, or allow yourself to be put in charge, of all the different parts of a project. Listening to other’s ideas will make the project seem more manageable and allow you to let go of some control., Try putting some effort into helping others have a good time. Sometimes bringing the focus off of yourself can be a great distraction when you are having trouble going with the flow. Putting your focus on someone else will also help you stay present in the moment rather than sinking back into regret or guilt.Engage them in conversation. Ask them to join your team on board game night. Offer to dance with them or get them a drink.  Be confident and clear about how you feel about a change in plans or idea. As long as you are open to what others have to say, your contribution will come off as helpful and you may be able to compromise with your friends. Think about a night out as a collaborative effort.   “I think seeing the movie after dinner is a good idea, but I’m worried we might feel rushed to finish our meal in order to get there on time. Perhaps we should see an earlier show and eat after? Or see the midnight showing and just get drinks in between? What do you guys think?” “I’m fine finishing up the spreadsheets but I don’t think I will be able to give them the attention they deserve if I’m also responsible for assembling the materials for the meeting. Could we split that task up among the group?”  

realize that you can’t control everything.  accept that you can’t control others.  practice exposing yourself to the unknown.try doing a small unpredictable thing each day.  let go of the idea that things need to be perfect.things are never going to be perfect.  look at the big picture.overall, will going along with a change of plans have any long term effects on your happiness?,  think about what you have to gain by going with the flow.  breathe.  live in the moment.  try to focus on the positives.if you are stuck brooding over things that have gone wrong try to shift your thinking to focus on the things that have gone right or that you have done well so far.maybe your presentation at work didn’t go quite the way you expected, but you can still focus on the work you’ve done for the project overall.  keep a journal.  trust that other people’s ideas can be as good as yours.  focus on someone other than yourself.  express your concerns. 

 If an autistic person stims around you, it often means that they trust you to let them be themselves. It also has meaning depending on the situation. It may be an expression of emotion, a way to reduce stress or overload, a focusing aid, or something else.Here are ways to get hints.    Facial expressions—Stimming while smiling usually means something different from stimming while frowning.  Words and sounds—What they say, or the sounds they make (crying, giggling, etc.) can give clues towards their feelings.  Context—A woman who waves her arms when shown a puppy is probably excited, while if she is waving her arms and whining while working on a difficult project, she may be frustrated or in need of a break. Sometimes stimming has no emotional meaning, similar to how standing up and stretching is not an indicator of your mood.  Eye contact can be distracting or painful for autistic people,so they may look at your shirt, your hands, the space next to you, their hands, et cetera.Their eyes may be unfocused during this time. This is usually because their brain is focusing on your words.   If you think they may be zoning out, try saying their name, verbally getting their attention, or gently waving your hand in front of their eyes (if nothing else works).  Many autistic people relax their facial features when their mind is busy. This may include a faraway gaze, a slightly open mouth, and a general lack of expression.   Some autistic people assume this expression by default when they are focusing on listening to someone. If an autistic person is staring into space by themselves, assume they are deep in thought. They can still hear you (but get their attention first if you want them to listen).  Stimming can help with self-calming, focus, and feeling good in general. If an autistic person is stimming while talking to you, assume that it enhances rather than detracts from their focus.  Some autistic people will make odd faces. Usually this means that they are comfortable enough around you not to censor themselves, which is a very good sign! Here are some potential meanings...    Happiness—Their unique way of smiling and having fun.  Stimming—They need to get their facial muscles moving, similar to how you might play with a zipper or toss around a baseball if you haven't had enough activity.  Being silly—They want to make you smile.  Natural expression—Some disabled people's normal expressions look different from non-disabled people's expressions.  Frustration or pain—Look for contextual clues to see if this matches.  Movements that seem jerky, clumsy, forceful, or "angry" may not mean anger—it may be dyspraxia, cerebral palsy, sensory processing disorder, or other disabilities that can affect ease of movement. If they often move this way, attribute it to their natural physical challenges, and be wary of misreading them as upset when they're just trying to do something., Autistic people are at high risk for anxiety, and may experience sensory issues that cause discomfort or pain. Unusually agitated movements (including stims) paired with a blank or upset facial expression may mean that the autistic person needs a break.   This can be useful for meltdown and shutdown prevention.  Autistic people can do all sorts of different things, from calling "Beep! Beep! Beep!" in tandem with the microwave timer to smiling and going limp when hugged. Don't worry about it. Recognize the value in their differences, and appreciate them for who they are.  

recognize that stimming can have many meanings.  recognize that looking elsewhere is often part of autistic listening body language.  interpret a blank expression as a thoughtful one, not as an empty one.  expect stimming as part of regular body language.  don't automatically interpret wild, random facial expressions as anger or frustration.  be aware of any movement disabilities.  look out for agitation.  understand that it's okay not to understand. 

 Swimming in natural bodies of water can be fun, but present their own risks.Know what the greatest risks are for the area you are swimming in.  If it is available always swim with a lifeguard present. They are trained to look for danger and provide assistance.  If you are swimming in the ocean these can be very serious threats. Riptides form when part of the sandbar gives way and water rushes out into the ocean. If you are caught in a riptide swim parallel to the shore until you are out of the pull of the riptide, and then swim diagonally to shore.  It will prevent head injuries due to unseen rocks or hazards. You should also test the water's temperature before entering. Even on a warm day a deep lake can be cold enough to induce hypothermia., Moving water has a remarkable ability to overwhelm even the strongest swimmer. If a river appears to be running quickly you need to be very cautious about entering as the current could easily present a hazard.   If you find yourself in a fast moving current, float on your back with your feet pointing downstream, and your head pointing up stream. Your feet will absorb any impacts from unexpected obstacles. When the current slows down , swim diagonally to shore. 

know your environment.  swim in front of a lifeguard.  watch out for riptides.  enter fresh water lakes and rivers feet first.  never swim in a high running current. 

 Don't lose your security deposit because you broke the rules in your lease. Ask your landlord or review your lease to see if you are allowed to paint (and if you have to paint it back to the original color when you move out) or make any other major changes.  Hang a colorful, textured rug. Put up temporary wallpaper or frame a sheet of wallpaper and hang it as an accent. Hang colorful art and photos to bring life to your blank walls.   Your landlord may agree to let you paint your walls a neutral color like white, cream, or grey.Add hidden pops of color by wallpapering the back of a bookshelf or painting sides and inside of your drawers a bright color. Remember to keep anything you remove so you can replace it when it's time to move. If you swap out hardware, blinds, or lighting, keep the original someplace safe.  Your landlord probably went with the most inexpensive option. Find hardware that fits into your design scheme and replace the old, cheap ones with something that is more "you" (again, remember to keep the original hardware to put back when you move out!).  

find out what you're allowed to change.  if you are not allowed to paint your room, get creative!,  trade out hardware like cabinet knobs, light switch plates and doorknobs. 

 Rabbits often resist being picked up by scratching and clawing. This can cause you to drop your rabbit and hurt it. Wear a long sleeve shirt so that your rabbit won’t be able to hurt you., Your bunny will want all four feet securely pressed against you, either your hand or body. So, it is good to place one hand underneath, securing all four feet against your arm, as if the bunny were standing on your arm.Place your thumb around the rabbit’s side and your forefinger around its chest to hold it secure.Never try to pick up your rabbit by an extremity, like its ears, tail, or the scruff on the back of its neck.  Your arm should reach around your rabbit’s back and across its body. Press it against your chest, to hold it securely., If your rabbit isn’t socialized and resists being held, you might need to hold it somewhat tightly against you. However, if your bunny is cooperative, you can reduce its stress levels by holding it more gently against you., When you are done with your rabbit, slowly bring it closer to the ground by squatting. Do not lean over and drop your rabbit suddenly. Place it on a surface that is ground level, flat, and not slippery., If your rabbit squirms or scratches when you hold it, you can put a towel around it to protect yourself. Throw the towel over it and then scoop it up, wrapping the towel around the bottom of the rabbit. 

wear a long sleeve shirt.  scoop up your rabbit with a hand under its torso.  wrap your other arm around your rabbit’s hindquarters.  hold your rabbit as gently as possible.  squat when placing your rabbit back on the ground.  wrap your bunny in a towel if it struggles. 

 Caring for a Rough Collie’s thick double coat can be challenging, but it is manageable with the right tools. While there are a variety of products and specialized tools on the market, you can properly groom your pet with a few basic items. Visit a pet store to buy:A bristle brush A long pin brush A basic comb Grooming scissors A matt splitter; , Pick a consistent spot to groom your pet that will be relatively distraction-free and comfortable. Opt for an easy to clean surface (e.g. the floor, a tabletop, a mat specifically reserved for grooming) that hair will not stick to. A raised surface will limit your dog’s movement and require less effort for you, but be sure that you will be able to lift a fully-grown dog onto it down the line., Starting to brush your puppy early (at around eight weeks old) will allow it to relax and cooperate in the future. Gently restrain the puppy with one hand and start brushing it very lightly with the pin brush to get it used to the process. Have your puppy sit or stand for brushing, either on the floor or on a raised surface like a table, and praise it for staying still., Brushing sessions for a full-grown collie should last about 30 minutes and cover different areas with specific tools and care. This regular brushing ensures that the coat and skin of your dog stay in top condition, and that its undercoat doesn’t get matted.Certain areas of your dog’s coat require special attention and sensitivity, such as:The front legs: the back of your dog’s front legs should be brushed with a pin brush, then with a comb to smooth hair The fluffy hair on the back legs should be brushed very carefully with a pin brush The hair on its tail should be brushed very lightly with a pin brush, as it is very sensitive Hair on the dog’s underside, where your dog may not enjoy being brushed. Use a pin brush, brush gently, and have someone help you keep the dog still if it gets restless All other areas should be brushed thoroughly with a pin brush, then with a bristle brush to ensure that the undercoat is as smooth as possible  , As your dog’s hair grows longer, it is important to look for mats in its coat while brushing. Mats occur in areas on the coat where there is rubbing or movement, or where old hair gets caught up with new, growing hair. Mats can be teased out with a comb to prevent them from becoming knots, which generally must be removed by gently dragging the mat splitter across the hair to cut the knot out. The key areas on your Rough Collie to look for mats are:The front legs, particularly near the top where the leg joint joins the body The hind legs, especially at the bottom where grass and twigs might get caught The rear, particularly near the base of the tail The tail  

buy the right tools.  choose a grooming spot.  get your puppy used to brushing.  brush specific areas carefully.  look for mats and knots. 

 This is the simplest camera set up, but it is also restricting, presenting what is happening in frame like a play and making it impersonal for the observer. In Barry Lyndon, Kubrick predominantly used static frames to connote the static structure of society.   Spectator focuses more on changes. Composition essential. Often shot symmetrically; , Pans are used to reveal new information such as an important clue or hidden character without cutting, so it is more fluid. Speed- Pans 'must' be slow, a common rule is it should take 5 seconds for an object to pan from one side of the frame to the other. Pans and Tilts are commonly used at the beginning and ending of a scene.  Like a pan tilts are used to reveal new information and are best done slowly.Tilts are effectively used to emphasize the height of something or as a moving close up revealing the details of a character.  If used too often it can look appalling and make the viewer feel sick. Nevertheless it can be used to great effect w with it connoting honesty, immediacy, and energy, and since it is the closest move to how we see the world it encourages viewer participation. It can be used effectively if juxtaposed against static shots. The camera operator can achieve more stability if the rehearse handheld moves and hold the camera close to their body.  Steadicams were revolutionary as they offered the freedom of handheld cameras, yet offer a stable picture. This meant that not longer was it a problem to film smooth tracking shots on stairs, rough ground or sand, while its fluid floating quality connotes the story being told from 3rd person NPOV (neutral point of view), dreams and fantasies., If done too often or too quickly it detracts from your film, this is usually because it is unmotivated. Yet a slow hidden(During movement in scene) zoom used at the right moment can be very powerful.    Track vs zoom. Tracks are generally better to use as they perform a more natural movement. A track in focuses the audience attention on the object or person. A track out makes the protagonist look, less powerful, vulnerable isolated. A circular track helps to externalise thematic ideas such as conspiracy.  Where you zoom out while pushing in which makes the subject appear still, but the background appears to stretch .

 There are a number of medical conditions that call for an ID bracelet, including diabetes, severe allergies, epilepsy, hemophilia, dementia, and rare blood types. Finding the right bracelet will depend a lot on your specific condition.The “why” of your ID is important. The needs of someone with an allergic condition will be different from what someone with a rare disease or kidney failure needs. Simple IDs usually have the universal symbol for medical emergencies: the “Star of Life” and the “Rod of Asclepius.” This is snake wrapped around a rod in what looks like a large asterisk. It is usually blue or red in color.You may also choose to include your name and other information on the ID, like your condition or health details and contact information.; , Ask yourself what kind and level of care you expect, as well. What sort of action do you need during an emergency? This will affect the sort of information – and maybe extras – that go onto your ID.   Someone with dementia, for example, may need a medical ID in case they get lost. They might benefit from an ID with built-in GPS technology. Someone with epilepsy may need an ID for care during a seizure, conversely, while someone with a rare blood type will need one in case they require an emergency blood transfusion. These are very different needs. You may also want to think about privacy. IDs can have contact information. Some now come equipped with embedded access to your health records.Think about what you would do if you lost the ID. Is the data sensitive?  , Based on your condition and needs, you can choose to buy a simple ID bracelet or one with add-on features. These range from 25-hour family and doctor notification systems to health information delivery services.  This includes an ID and wallet card, notification and wandering alert systems, and medical document storage.The same foundation also offers packages for adults and an Alzheimers “Safe Return” service. Extras may be beneficial for seniors who are in danger of falling, as well. Many companies can include a panic button on the bracelet or necklace, which allows the wearer to call for help by pressing a button. If paramedics should know a lot about your condition, you might also go for a medical ID with embedded access to your records. Alternately, a medical alert USB stick will hold all your medical information. These can be placed on a key chain or worn around the wrist or neck. 

keep your condition in mind.  assess your care needs.  decide if you want extras.  the non-profit medicalert foundation offers a “kidsmart service,” for example.

 There are a lot of websites that have a whole lot of information on penguins. There is a lot to learn about penguins, so you may be surprised at the facts that you learn.; , You don't have to dress in a full blown penguin costume. Instead, dress in black and white, which are the two colors that are found on all penguins.   While most species of penguins have a black back and a white belly, some species of penguins do have other colors on them, such as orange and yellow. If you'd like, include some of those colors in your outfit for the day.  Most zoos have a penguin exhibit, so you can see the penguins up close, and maybe even learn a bit more about them. While you're there, you can even visit other animals.  There are many movies out there about penguins, a lot of them being cartoons. Some movies are:   Happy Feet (one and two) Oddball Mr Popper's Penguins March of the Penguins The Penguin King Surf's Up The Penguins of Madagascar  , Global warming is one of the main reasons that some species of penguins are becoming endangered. Instead of driving everywhere, try to carpool, use public transportation, walk, or bike as much as possible.  There are plenty of penguin pictures online, some may make you smile, some may be pretty, and some may make you go "wow".  There are many charities that you can make a donation to, and the money can go towards penguins. Some agencies even allow you to 'adopt' a penguin in your name for charity. Some of these agencies may even be in your area.  Tell them about some cool facts you've found, let them know that some species of penguins are endangered.   Offer to carpool with them if you both need to go somewhere at some point during the day.  

educate yourself about penguins.  dress in penguin colors.  take a trip to your local zoo.  watch penguin movies.  take action to help reduce global warming.  look at penguin pictures on the internet.  make a donation to a charity in honor of penguins.  tell your friends about penguins. 

 Fear of flying stems from multiple sources. Does it make you feel claustrophobic? Do you stress over lack of control? Are you fine until the plane hits turbulence? Is the anticipation of the flight worse than the flight itself? Once you acknowledge the cause of your travel jitters you can begin finding methods to help prevent it. , Once you book your flight, begin learning calming breathing techniques. The more you’re able to practice these exercises, the easier they will be to use when travel jitters strike. A good exercise for beginners is abdominal breathing. Practice for ten minutes every day, a good time is right when you wake up and your mind is still calm. For added benefit, whenever you encounter a stressful experience, an important work meeting or a 3-hour pot roast burns, practice the breathing exercise. This will give you the opportunity to feel the helpful benefits before the pressure of flying! Place one hand on your belly and one on your chest. Breath in through your nose, expanding your diaphragm, for a count of five. (Your chest should not rise during your breath.) Breath out through our mouth for a count of five. Focus on pushing all the air out of your lungs. Repeat 6-10 times.  Travel jitters generally come from a mental, rather than a physical fear. Meditation focuses on overcoming those fears or anxieties. Through meditation you can learn to recognize and move past those anxieties. There are multiple forms of mediation but two that may be most beneficial to overcome travel jitters are mindfulness and visualization. Both are best practiced through finding a class or downloading a class from the internet. Mindfulness. Practicing mindfulness is about learning to live in the present moment. It does not banish travel jitters, but rather helps you acknowledge and move past these feelings. Visualization. Often, when you find yourself in a situation that causes panic, it can be helpful to visualize yourself in a different location. So when you sit down on the plane and begin to feel anxious, visualization can help you escape the immediate fear by placing your mind in a safer “happy place.”  , Once you’ve packed, go back through everything and double check that you have all the necessities. You don’t want to be on your way to the airport and realize you forgot your wallet! The length and location of your trip will affect your list, but here are a few necessities to help get you started. Once you’ve ensured you have everything you need, set it together by the door so you will not forget it when you leave the next day.   purse/wallet phone charger passport and foreign currency (if traveling out of the country) appropriate clothes and shoes for your destination medications ticket (if possible do an early, online check-in to avoid standing in an extra line the day of)  , Look up the travel time and have a plan to stay distracted during the flight. Reading a book, doing puzzles, or watching a movie are all great ways to stay busy. Make sure you consider time during take-off and landing (often some of the most stressful moments in flight) when you can’t use electronics! , If you have an early flight, allow yourself plenty of time to get up, organized, and to the airport. If your flight isn’t until later in the day, set an alarm to remind yourself when it is time to leave. Remember, for most domestic flights you should try to arrive at least 60 minutes, if you’re not checking baggage, and 90 minutes, if you are. For international flights you should arrive at least 2 hours early. If you are driving yourself, add an extra 30 minutes to your travel time, as parking is often a shuttle-ride away from the airport.  Is a friend driving you? Send a text to confirm the time. Taking a cab? Call and order one the night before. Driving yourself? Make sure your car has enough gas.  Drink a cup of tea, make your bed, or do some simple stretches. Whatever your normal routine, the more you’re able to stick to it on travel day the less stressful the day will seem. Just try your best to avoid extra caffeine as it increases feelings of anxiety.  About 10 minutes before your boarding time try to use the restroom. After you get on the plane there will likely be at least 30 minutes before the plane is in the air and you’re free to walk around the cabin. Additionally, if your anxiety over travelling stems from a fear of enclosed places, not having to use the small aircraft restroom will take an extra stress off your mind.  Mention your anxiety to the flight attendant or have a conversation with the person seated next to you. Don’t let the conversation spiral into a discussion about all the terrors of flying, but just having someone that knows how you’re feeling can be enough to keep travel jitters away. Remember 25 percent of people have some fear of flying and talking to those around you on the flight can help create a support group to help you through the flight. , Now is the perfect time to use the breathing and meditation techniques you’ve been working on! Remember deep abdominal breathing and whichever meditation technique you have been studying. Focus yourself as soon as you get on the plane and then at any point when you begin to feel jittery. Don’t wait until you’re feeling overwhelmed. The best way to deal with travel jitters is to keep them from happening!  , After you get settled on the plane get out a book and start reading. Find an interesting book before your flight, something by an author you know you enjoy. Begin the book a few days before the flight, stopping a few chapters in, preferably at a cliffhanger or plot twist. Then when you start reading during the flight you’re already into the story and more likely to keep your attention. , New regulations allow you to use small electronics during take-off and landing. Once the plane starts taxiing to the runway, take out your smartphone, iPod, or small tablet. Before flying download a new album from your favorite artist or put together a playlist of your favorite songs and listen to it during takeoff. Having headphones in will block out any noise from the plane during takeoff and help you feel more relaxed.  Once the flight gets going you’re able to take out your laptop. An engrossing two hour movie is a great way to use the majority of your flight time. If possible, pick a movie you’ve never seen before that has been on your “must watch” list for a while, or chose one of your favorites that you know will make you laugh.  The most important thing to remember during the flight is to keep yourself distracted. Go back to your book, listen to more music, play a game, meditate, or watch a TV show. Find whatever is best at keeping your attention and mind off of the flight stick with it!  

recognize your triggers.  practice deep breathing exercises.  learn to meditate.  make a pre-travel checklist.  put together an airplane bag.  set an alarm.  finalize your travel plans to the airport.  follow your normal morning routine.  use the restroom.  talk to people.  practice calmness.  read a book.  listen to music.  watch a movie.  stay busy.

 If sugar or high fructose corn syrup are at or near the top of the ingredient list, then the food gets the majority of its calories from sugar. According to Volumetrics guidelines, you should avoid or limit your consumption of these foods because of their high calorie density.  For instance, if adding brown sugar to a bowl of a whole grain cereal like oatmeal will persuade you to eat oatmeal, then go ahead and add a teaspoon of brown sugar to your oatmeal. Keep the sugar addition small so that the calorie density of the oatmeal stays low.  If you don’t like to eat fruit on its own, try some of these ideas:   Drizzle fruit with liqueur or sprinkle it with a small amount of shaved chocolate or chopped nuts. Eat fruit desserts that are lower in calorie density, such as frozen fruit pops or sorbet made with real fruit.  Use sugar substitutes as a tool for eating less sugar and not as an excuse to consume large amounts of foods that contain few nutrients.   Instead of choosing to eat a processed sugar-free package of cookies, choose to eat fruit. The fruit contains more nutritional value and a lower calorie density, which means that you can have more to eat. Don’t consume too much diet soda just to feel full. Instead of drinking multiple sodas, eat nutrient-packed foods with a low calorie density to fill yourself up.  

read the ingredient label.  use real sugar in small quantities.  learn to enjoy the natural sweetness of fruit.  use sugar substitutes wisely.

 Loud and frequent means he's announcing to the others that he's the ruler of the roost.; , Loud and frequent, accompanied by snarls means that he thinks he's being challenged, and is announcing that a fight to the interloper is about to begin.  Those barks means he's letting you know that a stranger is approaching.  Those are just a greeting bark to a familiar person.  Those barks means he's happy and wants to share his good mood with you.  Those barks means he wants you to pay attention to him (such as going for a walk).  These barks means he's telling you that you've gone too far. He wants you to back off and give him a little space, and some time to relax.  These mean he's detected something that he doesn't understand(unfamiliar sound/scent). he's frustrated by his inability to understand what you want from him.  This bark means he may have experienced a moment of pain. Check him for boo-boos of sharp objects or ticks/insects carefully.  These growls mean he wants you to back off and leave him alone. If he tell you this when he encounters a strange dog, back off and listen to him.  This growl is an aggressive response to a threat, and it's apt to be followed by a snap/bite. If it's a strange dog, leave well enough alone. If he's yours, don't immediately try to assert your dominance. Wait until the mood changes for comfort.  This growl means he's prepared to stand up for himself, even though he's unsure what the outcome will be.  This growl is a sign of contentment.  Your dog is fearing the unknown.

 Striking is the art of punching and kicking your opponent. In order to compete with the strong man face to face, you’ll need to develop striking skills. Find a local gym and talk to the trainer about taking classes.   The most popular and effective striking arts include American boxing, Muay Thai Kickboxing, and Karate. When fighting a strong man, use your speed to your advantage. Try to dodge his punches without getting hit. Don’t think you can become efficient at striking or at any martial art, without going to an official gym. Muay Thai for example, has been developed for several hundred years and requires an immense amount of skill., Many fights end up on the ground, or in a wrestling or grappling situation. This can pose an obvious disadvantage if you are competing against someone that's strong. If you’re able to learn how to grapple however, you will have the advantage against someone who is untrained in any grappling arts.   Popular grappling arts include wrestling, Greco Roman wrestling, Judo, and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.Going to the ground may even be a better situation if you can get top control or your opponent is efficient at striking. ”Rolling” or grappling practice is the best way for you to get experience. Take every opportunity to grapple with someone bigger and better than you when you attend your class. Once you have trained and refined your technique, sparring will give you a real experience if you get into a fight.  While they could never substitute real training and sparring, instructional videos can give you a glimpse into different ways you can protect yourself from a strong man. If you can’t afford a class, or there isn’t one in your area, this could be an alternative.   Do not rely on instructional videos before trying to beat a strong man. Make sure to check the ratings on the instructional video before you purchase it, so you know that others have found it effective.  

train in a striking martial arts discipline.  learn how to grapple if the fight goes to the ground.  watch instructional videos on how to defend yourself. 

   Like oil-based paints, you must first find a container where the water-based paint and thinner can be combined. While water-based paints can be removed with slightly less difficulty than oil-based paints, this container should still be one that you will not miss in the event that it is ruined.    Remove any dried pieces of paint from the liquid you pour into the mixing container.    As suggested by the name, you will use water to thin water based paints. Add clean, cool water in a ratio of approximately 3 parts paint to 1 part water for best results.    Use a stir stick to mix the paint and water. You can then use a paintbrush to apply to it a wall or canvas. As described previously, if the paint is still too thick, continue adding water is small amounts, testing the paint after each addition.  

find a container in which you can thin the paint.  add the paint to the container.  add the paint thinner.  mix and evaluate the paint. 

 There are many ways to cook chicken, but here are a few examples:  Blackening the chicken: Take a pan, put 1 tbsp (30 mL) oil (olive oil adds extra flavor!!) and heat up the oil. Meanwhile, season the chicken using whatever spices you like. Cover the chicken with the spices, and then place in the pan. Cook until no longer pink on the inside. Oven-baking the chicken: Season chicken and place in a greased baking pan. Bake 30-40 minutes, or until no longer pink. Grilling the chicken: Transfer the tenderized,seasoned chicken to the grill and cook until done. Stewing the chicken: In a proper stew, it is virtually impossible to produce tough chicken. This is one of the many reasons chicken stews of various types are found throughout the world. This can use both plain or marinated cuts of chicken.  Overcooking can lead to loss of moisture and proteins tightening up into bubblegum consistency. Experience will help you judge when chicken is done, but even professional cooks will still test with a thermometer to be certain. Test the temperature of the bird using a meat thermometer to determine whether it has reached the correct internal temperature. For most cuts of chicken, this will be 165 °F (74 °C).   Use a probe thermometer when cooking a whole bird, plunged into the deepest part of the breast. Use an instant read for smaller cuts like breasts and thighs.  Though seemingly contradictory to the "do not overcook" warning, low, slow cooking breaks down proteins, allowing for a more tender experience. This type of cooking also allows time for flavors and juices to penetrate into the meat, giving even more juiciness. It works best with bone-in thighs and other dark meat, or you could roast an entire chicken this way., Cover it with heavy-duty aluminum foil and let sit for 5 to 10 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute in the meat. If you cut it right away, the juices are more likely to drain out immediately instead of reabsorbing into the meat. This is especially important for whole roasted chicken or roasted chicken parts.   While this advice is absolutely true, be assured that carving right away will also not take your succulent chicken into a dry mess of a meal. It also makes sense to wait until the chicken is cool enough to handle, anyway. A chicken just out of the oven is too hot to cut into without risking burns. Chicken that hot will also burn when bitten into.  

pick your cooking method.  do not overcook the bird.  try a "low and slow" cooking method.  allow the meat to rest after cooking. 

 Petrified wood should never be cleaned with chemicals. When cleaning petrified wood, opt for a mild cleanser or a natural one. Mild hand soaps and apple cider vinegar are good options to clean petrified wood. These should be enough to remove dirt and grime from your wood and leave it looking clean and fresh.If your wood is not very dirty, opt for warm water alone.In rare cases, when stains are heavily set-in a pH-neutral all purpose cleaner is appropriate for petrified wood.; , Petrified wood should be cleaned with a softer cloth. Soft jersey or microfiber cloths are your best option for petrified wood. Stay away from any pads more abrasive than this to help preserve the wood., Cleaning petrified wood is simple. Gently rub down your wood with your pad and a small amount of your chosen cleaner. Wipe off any dirt and debris that's stuck to the wood to leave it clean and shiny.Use only warm water if you clean your wood regularly and it's not very dirty. The less products you use on petrified wood, the better.  

choose a mild or natural cleaner.  select a soft cloth.  wipe down your wood. 

   Take regular showers to keep your body clean and smelling fresh. Avoid overly scented soaps, as these may clash with perfume you use. Use deodorant and anti-antiperspirant. Like with soap, avoid any with a strong scent. Keep hair and nails appropriately trimmed and maintained. Don't forget to brush your teeth after every meal too! You don't want food sticking out of your teeth.; ,   Try your best to be blemish free. That means no acne, no pimples, and no bruises or scars. Sometimes it is unavoidable, but find the best way to take care of your skin. If you have acne or pimples you should go to a dermatologist to try to find a skin product that works for you. Keep your skin clean and clear by washing you face every day. You may or may not want to use soaps, as everyone's skin is different. Experiment to find a system that works for you.    Start with eyeliner. You should have either a a small amount of eyeliner or a medium amount of eyeliner. Trace the natural shape of your eye on the upper lash-line, and put a little "flick" at the end, it's a classic, always gorgeous look. Find your exact shade of concealer, and use that under your eyes if you have dark circles, and anywhere you may have scars etc. Use foundation if you need extra coverage or if your skin tone is uneven. To make your face appear more feminine, use a facial highlighter and apply on the high points of your face: your brow bone, your cheekbones, and the bridge of your nose. Curl your lashes and apply mascara. Using two eyeshadow colors, apply the lighter one all over the lid and the darker one in the crease. Find a lip color that works for you and use it, make sure you use a moisturizer before applying lip color. Choose one or the other if you plan on applying heavy makeup--eyes or lips.    Your hair should be nice and clean. Everyone's hair is different and unique, and all can be glamorous if you find the right style for your look. Don't be a stranger to volume! Any color is also possible, just make sure that it is befitting your natural coloring. Any color is ok, depending on your style. However, avoid bright colors because they tend to fade and look cheap. Your hair should be always shiny and healthy. This means using leave in conditioner and generally keeping it healthy, while also getting regular haircuts to maintain the ends.    Keep your nails trim, smooth, and healthy. Don't neglect your cuticles. Keep them smooth, healthy, and pushed back as necessary. Paint your nails, when you can. When the paint starts to chip, take it off.    Maintaining good posture will make you look more confident and will also make you look taller. Plus, it's good for you! Sleep on your back to help develop good posture, then maintain that straight back throughout the day. Strong stomach muscles are what help you stand straighter, so work out if you need to. You can also wear a back brace when you're at home to help train you to straighten your back.    Make sure that everything matches. This is way more important than having expensive clothes! Nothing says "glamour" like being put together. Keep colors matching by using a limited palette. Choose the colors that look best on you and then stick to well-matching colors or color families (Purple/Blue/Green, Red/Orange/Yellow, etc). Match styles as well. You don't want to mix a modern looking skirt with a vintage top or anything like that, as a general rule. While sometimes you can make it work and work well, it is easy to make it look off. A good example is if you go running, wear a matching velour tracksuit, with sneakers that fit, and maybe a cute (matching) graphic tee underneath. It shows that even on your lazy days you are trying, or maybe you are so rich that this was the slouchiest outfit you could put together!  ,   Determine your body shape (pear, hourglass, etc.) and then wear clothes that are best for that body shape. Different cuts of clothing can flatter different body types. For example, triangle body types, which have broad shoulders, should avoid clothes with shoulder padding or puffs. Wearing clothes that flatter your shape will make you look good pretty much no matter what your body looks like. Experiment to find what clothing cuts bring out your body's best features.    Clothing that doesn't fit can make you look fatter, lazy, cheap, or sick. Avoid clothes that don't fit in order to look healthy and amazing. Don't wear clothes that are too big and hang off your frame, or clothes that are too small and create bulges. You also want to avoid pants with a waist that is too low, as your bum will spill over when you move around and this will destroy your glamorous look. When you try on clothes, take three different sizes of the same item with you, one up and one down (even if you're sure of what your normal size is). Never be afraid to grab more sizes if those don't seem to work.    Don't wear clothes that look cheap. Avoid cheap looking fabrics like very low quality fabrics such as pleather (fake leather) or lame, fuzzy/feather materials. Opt instead for clothes made from fine fabrics like silk, satin, high-quality lace (like Chantilly), cashmere, or modal. Your clothes should also be well maintained. Don't wear clothes with holes or stains. Keep them clean, wrinkle-free, and looking sharp. Wear nice looking clothes even if you're doing things like running to the gym or doing errands. Adhering to all the trends is not only expensive but can also make you look like you're trying too hard and create embarrassing photos of you in the future. Look timelessly glamorous by wearing classic styles.       Trends to avoid include things like bell-bottom jeans, shoulder pads, or asymmetrical hem lines. Instead, wear things like button-up shirts, knee length skirts, suits, and classic-cut dresses. Look for inspiration to the look you are trying to achieve.    Never wear casual clothing if you can help it. Even your gym clothes should look nice. For whatever you're going out to do, shoot for dressing just a little bit nicer than what would be normal for the situation. Don't go over the top though, wearing a ball gown to a dinner party is way too much. This will just make you come across as clownish.    Make sure that even if you cannot afford expensive clothes, you accessorize well so that you liven the clothes up and make the outfit look more expensive. Wear earrings that are dramatic and have some sparkle or shine, but make sure that they fit the size and shape of your neck and face. You don't want them to look too big or too small. A small, fancy necklace to wear all the time is good because it can make even casual outfits look more dressed up and intentional. A diva-ish pair of sunglasses will never go wrong. Large sizes, like those popular in the 60s, look especially glamorous. A shiny watch is almost mandatory! Just make sure it fits and if you have to, get links removed or added. Also, make sure it is a color that goes with everything in your closet and matches your skin tone.    While looking confident won't make you visually look more glamorous, it will affect how people perceive you. If you want to be perceived as glamorous and fit in, you'll need to look like you love yourself and are comfortable in the skin you're in. You don't have to actually be confident but you do have to act like it (although you should learn to love yourself, and the rest will fall into place.) Most people, even if they seem really self-confident, actually are not, so don't feel bad. Don't constantly apologize or defer to other people. Don't criticize yourself or put yourself down. A little self-deprecating humor is okay though. Speak up for yourself, be kind and compassionate (not stuck up or offensive), have good posture, and don't be afraid to do things that make you stand out, like talking intellectually, or about things you are passionate about.    Getting overly angry or emotional can ruin the glamorous look, making you look immature or like a bit of a jerk. Can you imagine Audrey Hepburn being a jerk? No. Never create a scene, yell at people who upset you, or generally get extremely sensitive about something that's going on. Be in control of yourself, emotionally as well.    Speaking meaningfully, like acting confident, will help create the perception of glamour. The smarter you speak, the more classy and elegant you will seem. An accent isn't necessary to make yourself seem more glamorous, so don't try to fake one. Instead, use the best grammar and vocabulary that you can. Practice speaking when you're alone, if that helps you to overcome bad habits.    Remember that since being glamorous is about creating a great first impression, make sure to use your manners, especially when meeting someone for the first time. Every time you step outside your home into the public eye, strive to convey your image of glamour, but no matter what, stay true to yourself (people will respect you for it.) Imagine that you have photographers following you around all day--if they're snapping pictures, what do you want them to capture? And is it glamorous?  ,   You may not be able to hop on a jet and lounge on a Brazilian beach just like that, but you can be selective in your activities. If you want to lead the glamorous life of an artist, for example, it's more fitting to hang out in coffee shops , discussing art history with like-minded people til the early hours of the morning than to go bar-hopping.    For those on a budget, you can use classic pieces. Imagine an old Hollywood actress is helping you decorate, but don't be afraid to add color. Stay away from multiple different patterns, it will be too loud and distracting. The key is to look classic and fairly modern with your décor. Watch old movies to get ideas. You can also go to your local antique store and find pieces that you like.  

keep your body clean and tidy.  keep your face clean and clear.  apply makeup only as you feel necessary.  maintain your hair.  keep your nails looking perfect.  stand up straight.  coordinate your outfits.  wear clothes that flatter your natural shape.  always wear clothes that fit.  wear nice clothes.  don't dress down.  accessorize!,  act confident.  keep your emotions level.  think before you speak, making sure not to offend anyone or showing you may be scatter-brained.  be glamorous to be seen.  live a glamorous lifestyle.  make your home glamorous too. 

 Add the chicken stock concentrate, sesame oil, soy sauce, finely grated ginger, whole wheat spaghetti, frozen vegetables, shredded chicken, and toasted sesame seeds to a heat-safe mason jar or stoneware mug with a lid. Make sure to add the ingredients in the proper order.You can substitute zucchini or carrot noodles for the whole wheat pasta. You can add whatever frozen vegetables you like. A mix made for stir fry that contains veggies such as carrots, peppers, broccoli, and/or water chestnuts is a good option. If you don’t have leftover chicken to add to the jar, you can shred the meat from a grocery store rotisserie chicken.; , Once all of the ingredients are in your container, place the lid on to seal it. Keep the container in your refrigerator until you are ready to eat.The instant noodles will keep in your refrigerator for 3 to 5 days. If you’re bringing the noodles with you to work or school, make sure to throw a cold pack into your lunch bag to keep them cold.  When you’re ready to eat the noodles, fill the container with boiling water to an 1-inch (2.5-cm) below the top. Place the lid on the container, and allow the noodles to steep for 2 to 3 minutes.If your container is microwave-safe, you can also add lukewarm water to the container and microwave it on high for 1 to 2 minutes.  After you’ve allowed the noodles to steep for a couple of minutes, remove the lid. Use a spoon to stir the noodles and ingredients together well to ensure that the chicken stock concentrate has dissolved completely before eating. 

combine all of the ingredients in a jar.  store in the refrigerator until ready to eat.  add boiling water to the jar and steep the noodles for several minutes.  stir the noodles well before eating. 

 Providing an appropriate title for your column will help set the reader's expectations and grab his or her attention.Catchy titles often include numbers, fun adjectives, and a promise to the reader.For example, “Getting Stains Out of Your Carpet” is a title that’s not likely to capture your reader’s attention. However, this title will: “3 Unusual Household Items That’ll Get Red Wine Stains Out.” This title uses numbers, gives the reader a promise, and lures them into reading on to find out what these unusual household items are.  Make that first sentence count by enticing the reader with your words and ideas. Remember that your opening also lays the foundation for your argument, so make sure it’s relevant.Opening lines that will catch your reader’s attention include dramatic anecdotes, a controversial statement, irony and wit, a major new study, or a statement that turns conventional wisdom on end.In his health and well-being column, columnist Oliver Burkeman begins his story: “About a month ago, to my embarrassment, I learned I’d been tying my shoelaces wrongly my whole life.” This opening line grabs our attention with a catchy anecdote and makes us want to read on to find out what he was doing wrong and what the correct way to tie a shoe is., As you write your article make sure every paragraph can answer the question: “Who cares?” Explain why your topic is relevant to your readers and how it will positively or negatively affect them.For example, if you’re writing against a new tax proposal explain to your readers that this new policy will increase their taxes.  While you shouldn’t throw all the writing rules out the window, you should avoid jargon, technical language, and complex sentence structure. By writing in a more conversational manner, you’ll be able to communicate your point to your audience more effectively.Try writing in shorter sentences or using contractions to adopt a more conversational style. Pretend that you’re writing to a friend and address the reader directly. Try talking in your head as you write and then read it aloud afterwards to see how it sounds., Using active verbs comes across as more authoritative and it’ll help cut down on wordiness. Since you’re trying to convince a reader of your opinion, using strong, active verbs will help you do this.Stating that, “It is believed by the city council that the townspeople were misled by the mayor” is wordy and leaves the author wondering if the city council is an authoritative source. Instead, try writing that, “The city council believes that the mayor misled the townspeople.” You can note how the active voice sentence is more authoritative and straightforward.  

have a catchy title.  open with a “hook” that will grab your reader’s attention.  tell your reader why they should care.  write conversationally.  use active voice. 

 If you are writing about your family as a way to practice and improve your English, you should use a prompt to get you started. You can create your own prompt or find a prompt online. You may challenge yourself to write a certain number of words about your family, such as 250 words. Or you may challenge yourself to write a certain number of sentences about your family, such as 10 sentences.For example, you may use a prompt like: “Write about your family members” or “My family members are…” As part of the prompt, you could pretend you are talking to someone you just met who asked you to tell them about your family.  When you write about your family, use the present tense and write in short, clear sentences. Identify all of your family members by name and discuss where your family members live. Use “brother, sister, mother, father, uncle, aunt, cousin, etc” to identify your family members.For example, you may write: “Let me tell you about my family. I have a mother, a father, two brothers, and one sister. We also have a dog named Pepper. We all live together in a house in Reno, Nevada. We have lived in the house since I was born. After they were married, my mother and my father moved to the house to start a family.”  , Once you have completed the draft about your family, you should show it to others to get feedback. Show the draft to your teacher, your instructor, or to a native English speaker. Get feedback from them on your sentence structure, your word choice, and your spelling or grammar. Then, apply the feedback to the draft.   You may end up adding in more details into the draft based on your teacher’s feedback. By the end of the revision process, you should have a strong, completed draft that showcases your English skills.  

use a writing prompt.  create a first draft.  show the draft to others and revise it. 

 Though there are exceptions, most horses are fairly calm and docile when left to themselves. Watching a herd of horses feed in a field a short distance away from you can make them seem much less intimidating than they might otherwise. Once you're comfortable with this, you can gradually start interacting with horses close up.   Use this opportunity to observe horse body language. Note the way they move their heads, ears, and rears when they interact with each other. For example, a horse that's upset will often pin its ears back (move them so that they lay flat against its head).; , Horses are remarkably good at sensing when people are nervous. If you approach the animal when you are calm, cool, and collected, the horse will probably stay this way too. Make sure a horse can see you coming; they're most comfortable when humans don't take them by surprise. Move towards the horse's front shoulder, staying out of the small blind spot in front of the horse's nose.   Use slow but purposeful movements. Try not to hesitate as you approach. If he moves away from you, move with him, continuing toward him. Don't stop until his feet are still.  When you reach the horse's shoulder, make sure it can see you, then gently lay one hand on the base of its neck. Offer a few gentle words of greeting and encouragement as you pet it. If the horse moves away, approach its shoulder again and repeat. Eventually, it will learn you are not a threat (and you will learn that it is not a threat!)   Pet in the direction of the hair. Going against the grain can be uncomfortable for horses.  Helping an experienced trainer do basic tasks like grooming is a good way to gain respect for the care that goes into raising horses, while also improving your confidence around them. Ask a horse professional for a chance to help with washing, brushing, or another grooming task to build up your confidence.  This is a fun activity that can make the horse feel more at ease around you (and vice versa). While you can buy treats for this, most horses will be just as happy with things like hay, carrots, and apple slices. Offer the horse the treat by holding it away from your body, about a foot or so in front of its nose. If the horse doesn't seem to want it, don't thrust it into her face.   Keep your palm flat as you offer the food to the horse. This keeps the horse from biting one of your fingers by accident.  If you're not familiar with horses, get a professional to help you secure a lead rope to the horse. With a grip on your lead rope (12-15 feet of rope is a good length), take a step away from the horse and look at his hindquarters. Lean in and begin to swing the end of the rope in a circular pattern to tell him you want him to move his hindquarters away from you. Stop the moment he reacts, and turn away with no more threat in your posture. This teaches the horse to submit to your commands, and can help him become more docile around you.   If he does not move after a couple of swings of the rope end, swing it so that it hits his hindquarters firmly. Continue repeating this exercise until he respects your requests as soon as you look at his hindquarters and lean in.  If you're worried about getting hurt by a horse, it's helpful to know that a horse will have a very hard time harming you if you watch where you are. Staying arm's length from the horse's front shoulder is a good general policy. Here, it's difficult for the horse to kick you, rear up, or bite (which, of course, is unlikely anyway).  While most horses at training centers that accept beginners will be perfectly safe, the owners may be able to recommend you a horse that is especially calm or docile. This can help you build up your confidence. It's much easier to relax around a horse that you know is very unlikely to cause any trouble.  "Tack" is a term used for the equipment used to ride the horse (i.e. saddle, reins, etc.). Learning to put this on is an important horse-riding skill, but it's also a valuable opportunity to gain confidence working closely with a horse.   See our tacking guide for specific instructions. Get a professional to help you if it's your first time.  This will improve your confidence by helping you feel more in control. Mount the horse and pull one rein to your thigh until his nose touches your leg. The very moment you feel him submit (by taking the pressure off the rein himself), let the rein go slack again. Do this consistently and he will learn to be very flexible to your commands with a very light touch on the rein. Do this on both sides multiple times before you ask him to move forward at a walk.   This is practicing your "one rein stop" — basically the emergency brake anytime you get in trouble.  Once you know you can stop the horse, have a steady walk around and make sure you are comfortable in the saddle. Don't feel pressured to start trotting, cantering, or anything else — just walk as long as necessary to feel completely confident.   When you're comfortable walking, work with the trainer or professional to gradually ramp up to a canter or trot. Increasing your speed in stages will help you get accustomed. Practice the one rein stop described above at a walk, then at a trot and canter. You need to practice it as much as he does. It needs to be a reflexive move that you do without thinking as soon as any trouble starts. To learn to think like this, you need to practice it.  

watch horses from afar.  approach horses calmly from an angle.  offer the horse affection.  groom the horse.  feed the horse.  get the horse to respect you by using a lead rope.  stay in a horse's "safe zones.",  ask to be paired with a beginner-friendly horse.  tack up the horse before you get on.  get the horse to submit to your rein commands.  walk before working up to a trot or canter. 

(The size doesn't particularly matter, but if you do something different you will have to adjust the numbers that are posted here.); , Then create a new layer (shift+ctrl+n). Select Filter-->Render-->Clouds. Your image should look like this:  , Now feather the selection by 20 pixels (Select-->Feather..., 20) Fill this selection with black using the paint bucket tool (press "K")  , Lastly, go over the the layers palette and move this layer down below the black version. At this point, make sure the white circle is centered. It will look like this: Your layers Palette should look like this:  , It might look something like this:  ,, At this point you can expand the hole to fill the metal part. Simply select the black circle (layer 2) and use ctrl+e to merge the black and white circles together. Then you can use the move tool ("V") to change the size. Your bullet hole is coming together now, and will look something like this:  , 'Ctrl+click on Layer 1, to make a selection of that layer. Make a new layer, and fill the selection with black. Move the layer below layer 1, and offset it a little bit, to look like this:  , Go to filter-->blur-->Gaussian blur and play with the settings there. The higher the number, the blurrier, and the farther away the shadow will look. The same works with opacity, but the numbers go down. In this example, a value of 6.7 pixels was used for the blur, and the opacity was set to 23 percent.  Here's an example:  

in adobe photoshop, open a new document of the dimensions 800x800 px, with a resolution of 72 pixels per inch.  press "d" to restore the default colors to black and white.  create a new layer again, and draw a circle in the center using the elliptical marquee tool (press "m"), while holding down "shift".  with the same layer selected, press ctrl+j to duplicate the layer, or right click on the layer in the layers palette, and select "duplicate layer" then, press ctrl+i to invert the layer, and use the move tool ("v") to enlarge it slightly.  now, select the clouds layer and use the polygonal lasso tool to draw a spikey, star-like shape around the hole.  with the clouds layer still selected, invert the selection (select-->inverse or ctrl+shift+i) press backspace to delete the selection, and then deselect with ctrl+d to leave something like this:  ,  apply filter-->sketch-->chrome with 0 for detail and 2 for smoothness.  now add a shadow.  the last step is to play with the shadow layer settings.  now all you have to do is drop it into an image that needs a bullet hole or two.

 During sleep paralysis you will feel conscious and aware but unable to move your body or speak. This phenomenon could last just a few seconds, few minutes or in very rare cases longer. It is not unusual for people experiencing sleep paralysis to feel pressure on the chest or a choking sensation, as if something were pushing down on their chest.The paralysis does not cause you any harm, but it can be a frightening situation, especially if you have not experienced it before. Some people will experience it a few times in their life, others more frequently, and some not at all. Typically, it is more frequently observed in teenagers and young adults, although it can affect anybody and is not thought to be influenced by gender., The main symptom of sleep paralysis is the sense of consciousness without being able to move. This is often coupled with a feeling of restricted breathing. It is not uncommon for someone to experience scary hallucinations and have a powerful sense that there is something threatening in the room during sleep paralysis. These hallucinations may be especially vivid because you are semi-awake when you are dreaming.These symptoms can create an anxious and disturbed feeling which can persist after you move out of sleep paralysis.Sleep paralysis itself can be a symptom of narcolepsy., Sleep paralysis itself does not cause you any harm, but if you experience it frequently it can be upsetting and disruptive for your sleeping pattern. Most often, making adjustments to your sleep cycle so it is more regular, and trying to limit stress in your life will lower your chances of experiencing sleep paralysis. If it is having a negative impact on you, visit your doctor for advice. In some cases the doctor may prescribe a short course of antidepressants.If you have severe symptoms, they may be connected to another sleep disorder, such as narcolepsy. Visit your doctor if you experience excessive sleepiness during the day and are finding it difficult to concentrate on everyday tasks. 

know what it is.  recognise the symptoms.  know when to seek medical help. 

 Telling yourself to simply stop thinking about your infatuation won’t work. In fact, there’s proof that trying to stop these thoughts typically makes them worse. Instead, encourage your mind to think about something else: another person.   Think about the person you are already in a relationship with, if you are in one. Ponder a time when you felt really close and connected to the person. You’ll likely find that experiencing these feelings kick the other person out of your head.If you aren't in a relationship, focus on someone else you admire, such as a close friend, a family member, or a respectable member of your community.  Play mind games with yourself whenever you start to obsess about the person. Occupying your brain with a clever trick can stop the thoughts and encourage you to think about something else.   For instance, imagine your mind as a small room that has a person with a broom living in it. Think about the person sweeping away dust and dirt on the floor of that room whenever your infatuation enters your mind. Continue this game until the floor is completely clean and the thought leaves your brain., Pain is an excellent deterrent and can be used to stop obsessive thoughts. Wrap a rubber band around your wrist and snap it against your skin whenever you begin to think of your infatuation. Eventually you’ll likely associate the pain with these thoughts and stop.Combine the wrist snap with a visual aid, like a red light or a stop sign. Think of these images whenever the unwanted thoughts pop up.  Redirect your brain by engaging in an activity. You’ll get your mind off of what you’re infatuated with while enjoying yourself at the same time.   For example, read a book, watch your favorite television show, exercise, or call someone. The positive feelings you generate from these activities will likely eventually replace the negative you feel over your infatuation. 

think about someone else.  use your imagination.  snap out of it, literally.  distract yourself. 

 While standing, raise your arms straight into the air. Your palms should be oriented towards the sky and fingers pointing behind you.This exercise is best learned with a friend nearby for support if necessary.  Puff out your chest and slowly lower yourself backwards towards the floor. Take your time and control your movement. Moving too fast can cause you to lose your balance and fall, injuring yourself.If you’re stuck here, you may find it helpful to use a chair or table as a halfway support. You can use the support until you’re confident in your ability to go all the way down. Bending all the way backwards takes some serious flexibility. If you’re stuck, get into a bridge and rock back and forth. Rock all the way onto your hands and feet. This allows your back to really curve and helps prepare for the standing bend., Once you begin to approach the ground, lock your arms to ensure that you don’t smack your head when you land. After your arms have been locked, keep arching back until your hands are on the ground.Keep your stomach flexed and pointed tight to the ceiling as you hold the position.   While in a backbend, keep your feet firmly planted.Imagine your weight being distributed evenly on all four limbs. This will help you stay balanced.  While professionals can arch their way back up and out of a backbend, you may find it easier to let your knees drop, and unlock your arms. Tuck your head into your chin and cave your body. This will put you flat onto your back and safely on the floor.  

place your arms over your head.  arch your back and move down.  lock your arms and hold.  exit the bend. 

 In order to play this role, you will want to learn the environment and flank the enemy. You should not be near the main force but be flanking the sides.. Typically you will want cover like in the woods along a creek. You will want to stay out of open areas. After you have looked over your map (obtaining a map is easy, look at the field's website to see if they offer one or type in the location on Google Earth and print out the satellite view), you will want to get a few people in your squad (3-5 people will be good). If you have your own squad then that is even better.; , Watch your footsteps, communications, and after every 5-10 steps stop and scan for enemies. Constantly be aware of your surrounding so you know what cover to go to in case of an ambush.  If you have any type of communication with main force (through radio, phone, etc), let them know the position your about to assault so they do not fire upon you. 

what makes a special operations squad different then any other is tactics and how they fight.  stay as quiet as possible.  after you have successfully flanked your enemy, lay down fire on them.  after taking out the enemies, keep on the enemies flank or link up with the main force and finish the assault.  

 If you need to get your system clear of cocaine, stop using the drug right away. One-time users will have cocaine in their urine for at least 4-8 hours afterwards, but cocaine can still be detected for up to 4 days even after a single use.However, habitual users can show up positive on a drug test for up to a month.The sooner you stop using, the sooner you’ll be clean.  This is your body rebalancing itself in terms of energy and mood. Expect to be tired and potentially depressed for a short time, even up to 2-3 days.The cocaine crash is not the same thing as withdrawal, though there are some overlapping symptoms.  If you’ve been using cocaine regularly, you will probably experience symptoms of withdrawal when you remove it from your life. Tell yourself ahead of time that you will get through it, and prepare yourself mentally to experience any of the following:Severe cravings Nausea and vomiting Paranoia, depression, or anxiety Mood swings or irritability Itching or a feeling that something is crawling on your skin Insomnia, sleeping too much, or vivid and distressing dreams Fatigue and exhaustion  , If you’ve been using cocaine for a long time or using it often, you may need to go through medically-supervised detoxification. There’s no drug that can remove cocaine from your system, but a medical professional can help you through withdrawal by giving you medications to counteract the withdrawal symptoms. If you need help, look online for a detox center near you.Depending on your symptoms and how heavily you used cocaine, a detox program can last from 3 days to over a week. An inpatient rehabilitation program can last around 30 days. Outpatient detox can cost you between $1,000-1,500, whereas a full rehab program can cost up to $20,000.  There’s no great way to flush your system of cocaine and its metabolites (what your body turns it into), so you may just have to wait it out. If so, know that how long cocaine takes to leave your system depends upon a number of different factors:How much you used: More cocaine takes longer to leave. How often you use it: The more often you use, the longer it lasts in your body. What was mixed with the cocaine, i.e. how pure it was: Purer cocaine leaves more drug in your body. If you were also drinking alcohol: Alcohol slows down elimination of the drug at first, keeping it in your body longer. How well your liver and kidneys function. If you have liver or kidney problems, your body won’t clear cocaine as effectively as in a healthy person. Your weight: Cocaine sticks around longer in heavier individuals.  

stop using cocaine immediately.  anticipate the “comedown.” anyone who uses cocaine will likely have a comedown or “crash” after the initial effects of the drug wear off.  prepare for withdrawal symptoms.  go into a detox program.  wait. 

 The Acela train travels over the same route as that of the Northeast Corridor's route (from Boston's South Station to Washington's Union Station) making some major stops in cities between these stations from Boston, MA to Washington, DC including some major stops in New York (NY), Philadelphia(PA), Wilmington (DE), Baltimore (MD) and leading up to Washington (DC). Though there are multiple lines running through and around the path where the Acela runs, there is only one single line to and from the places that the Acela will run on.  Understand some of the other intended stops. It does make a few other stops on the line, and especially from the point of New York and points south, if it stops at one point, it won't stop at the other (look at a timetable of Acela trains and watch these differences are affected). Although it has stops in Newark (never at Newark International Airport) and Metropark, NJ, if it stops at one station, it definitely won't stop at the other. It also takes up a few stops in Southern Massachusetts (not nearby Cape Cod), and Rhode Island, and Connecticut. It does make a stop or two in the tip of Southern Westchester County (New Rochelle as being one of its biggest stops in New York).; , Although most often times the Acela will have a train coming through about once every hour, due to seasonal changes and other track maintenance/work and other unintended delays, its time schedule can be delayed at times.   Realize that the train may be stopped for up to one hour in New York, NY (Penn Station), as this stop is it's largest and most regularly-boarded stop on the route. It will take them awhile to debunk passengers as well as collect new passengers who are boarding, then they wait until the rest of the nearby track is clear (near the Hudson River crossing into New Jersey) and then take off again; all a process of about the hours wait. However, don't dilly-dally around when they say your train is "now boarding" from the timetable board.  Obtain some money to pay for the intended trip. It's best to pay for an Acela trip as soon as those days are available to be seen directly from Amtrak's website, as fares for those days are always cheaper, and will always cost more as the trip-date nears. For a trip from New York to Washington, most Acela trains will run you $200-$300 from your pocket (and even more if you request to be upgraded to First Class/Business).  Be sure to print out your Amtrak "receipt" and scan it into the self-service TripTicket kiosk, or if the nearby stationmaster is able to assist you, most stations will be able to print you out your tickets from that specific itinerary. If purchased from the Amtrak mobile app or from the Amtrak website, you can also have your tickets forwarded right to your virtual wallet on your phone. , If you purchased a digital ticket that can be displayed on the phone, make sure the pass is open in the virtual wallet on your phone so that the scanning experience for the train engineer is seamless.  

try to understand the acela train route.  obtain a schedule of train departures and arrivals to see when and exactly where which acela train will stop at the designated station.  purchase a seat from the amtrak website, via the self service kiosk or from another official amtrak-approved method.  pick up your tickets a few days before the trip (if you haven't already thought about that differently).  board your train when the station board says that your train is "now boarding" for that train number.  ,  be prepared to hand your acela ticket to the amtrak attendant who will come around to collect them. 

 When you are selling off-line, you will want to take advantage of social interaction. You might want to organize an in-home product demonstration and take advantage of friends’ networks.   Find spots where many target consumers gather, such as farmers' markets or the local fair. Build trust in your brand by sponsoring local events. Try giving some of the product away. People respond to giveaways because, if they like your product, they will want to buy it. , People who sell things often have a network of sources built up. They go to lunch with a lot of people, and they are quick to hand out and collect a business card. Word of mouth springs from relationships, in part. Listening to a customer and perceiving their needs is a key part of the selling process. Cold calling without any understanding that your product might be a fit for the consumer rarely works out very well. In contrast, developing long-term relationships with people will make you a good seller because they will come back for more product and will tell their friends to buy from you too. Selling can take time. They say that selling things can be a marathon, not a sprint. It's a process. Try to be candid when you talk to potential customers instead of sounding rehearsed. If you sound too rehearsed, they won't trust you as much.  You will want to figure out a budget for advertising and marketing and consider ways you can reach your audience more cheaply, such as through social media.   Determine whether you want to advertise on radio, television, and in the newspaper, as well as new media environments. What will best reach your target consumer? For a company, figure out your minimum and maximum advertising budget by taking 10 and 12 percent of your projected annual gross sales. Multiple it by the markup from your average transaction. Then deduct your rent from each. The remainder is your minimum and maximum advertising budget. , If you are just trying to get rid of a lot of household items, consider holding a rummage sale.   Advertise your rummage sale, in the newspaper and online through local social media sites or sites like Craigslist. Give a good listing of the types of items you are selling and any unique items you have. Portable items sell best at rummage sales. So think about what clothing items or household pieces you have to sell that people can easily take with them. Figure out the best day to hold your rummage sale. People are less likely to go to your rummage sale on weekdays during the day, for example. Call your city, village or town hall to determine whether you need a permit for your rummage sale. This will vary by community.  

embrace social interaction.  building relationships matters.  develop a marketing plan.  consider a rummage sale. 

 Keeses will only attack you once you get close to it. Once you get inside a dark room or dungeon, you’ll see these creatures hanging beside the walls or any structures in the area.

 While not part of the exfoliating process per se, immersing your body in hot water will open up your pores, making your skin much more susceptible to cleaning. It also helps to do this process in the bathroom, as you'll need a ready supply of hot water and somewhere to wash away the dead skin flakes once they've been scrubbed off. Use a skin-friendly, perfume-free detergent for bath and allow at least 15 minutes to soften (macerating) the skin surface. It is good when the skin surface looks a bit "deformed". Remove "dead skin" by rubbing it away with your hands. It will work well, especially at your feet, toes and heels.; , Tending to your skin with it will help rub away excess skin flakes, leaving your skin softer and cleaner than before. It is recommended you have a sponge ready for use once you have finished up your shower. It should feel slightly rough on your skin, but if it's abrasive to the point of pain, exfoliating wash cloths are a suitable, gentler alternative. Exfoliating can also be done with a rough washcloth. A natural bristle brush makes for a good alternative, particularly while scrubbing the backs of arms or legs. If you're the do-it-yourself type, you might look into making your own loofah from home.  Scrub the sponge over your skin in small, circular motions. Make sure to apply some pressure to feel the sponge's rough texture on your skin; that way, it will rub the surface-layer dead skin away. Starting at the ankles is recommended because it helps to encourage positive blood circulation during the exfoliation process.If you're exfoliating your entire body, make sure to give extra attention to your heels, elbows, and knees. These are generally considered to be the driest parts of one's skin, and should be given greater attention accordingly.  If you've ever walked along the beach barefoot, you may have noticed your foot callouses soften. Sand granules are a naturally occurring exfoliant, and their grainy texture is well-suited to scraping away your excess skin flakes. Acquire a cup of sand, soften it with water, and rub it over your body. Although you cannot add a scrub or lotion to the sand like you can with a loofah or wash cloth, the sand's malleable form makes it a more relaxing and enjoyable way to exfoliate mechanically. Be forewarned: Using sand in the bath can cause a bigger mess than more common exfoliants. Although it is recommended to try it out at least once, it may not be the best course of action if you don't have the added time in your routine available to do a bit of cleaning up afterwards. Getting sand down a drain could completely ruin the plumbing pipes if done often. If using sand, it should be cleaned, even bleached, because getting it from outdoors could introduce bacteria and using that to exfoliate would do more harm than good. Choose sand with small granules, not big, because the smaller granules are more gentle on the skin. Focus on the tougher skin of the arms and legs because sand can be more intense than exfoliating scrubs.  Closing up shop with a body rinse is a relaxing and effective way to finish your exfoliation. Although it's recommended you repeat this process at least three times a week, you should notice an immediate softness with your skin.   Applying a moisturizer or shea butter following your rinse, even following an otherwise purely 'mechanical' cleanse, will help your skin better retain moisture.  

have a bath or shower.  get a textured sponge to wash your skin.  scrub your body gently with your sponge starting from the ankles upward.  add wet sand to your full body exfoliation.  rinse with hot water.

 This means relinquish the inner resistance you have been offering to the undesirable circumstances, thoughts and other stimuli. Say an 'inner' yes to the present, doesn't matter what you say or do externally but there should be an 'inner Yes' or an inner alignment to what is. What does it mean to say 'inner Yes'?   It means say 'yes' to the thoughts and emotions that arise in your consciousness by allowing, accepting or giving them full attention, etc. However, you don't have to follow them. As thoughts create a lot of problems too. When there is an inner acceptance then you have a choice to follow a thought or refuse to follow it, externally. In the same way you would have a choice to follow circumstances or people or refuse to follow them. There will be time when you would have to say 'No', externally, but that would be a deeper 'No'. Not from ego but from deep within you. Do experiments to learn, like refuse to follow some thoughts and then see the result. However there should always be an inner yes, an inner acceptance.  Give your full and unconditional attention to anything you are doing. Like brushing your teeth, cooking, washing your hands, walking etc. Most people are lost in thoughts while doing these chores, but these simple chores can be great opportunities to practice surrender."Everybody's life really consists of small things. Greatness is a mental abstraction and a favorite fantasy of the ego. The paradox is that the foundation for greatness is honoring the small things of the present moment instead of pursuing the idea of greatness" (Eckhart Tolle).  On a Universal level, 'Giving' is the same as 'Receiving'. The more you give, the more you will receive. If you feel like you are lacking something in life then ask yourself, "What can I give in this situation?" Try this for a couple of weeks and see how it changes your reality: Whatever you think people are withholding from you- praise, appreciation, assistance, loving care, and so on – give it to them. You don't have it?Just act as if you had it, and it will come. Then, soon after you start giving, you will start receiving. You cannot receive what you don't give. Outflow determines inflow. Whatever you think the world is withholding from you, you already have, but unless you allow it to flow out, you won't even know that you have it. This includes abundance.  Be aware of your breath, inner body or sense perceptions, as much as you can. Our inner body is a bridge between form and formless(Universal intelligence). So keeping some attention with in while doing anything, not only keeps you connected to present moment, but also make your actions high quality.Read Stay Rooted in Being for more depth.  If you are aware enough you would have noticed physical reactions to your thoughts in body and vice versa.Like tautness in face or brain muscles and muscles around your heart in response to a thought.   Similarly, have you noticed emotional reactions to your fearful thoughts in body? like anxiety, fear, anger etc? If you could single out the moment, you will observe that physical pain and emotions are simply intense pressure or uneasiness or energy you feel somewhere in the body. For the most part, that doesn't make you unhappy. Its the reactive thoughts in response to these that make you unhappy. As mentioned before - feel this pain or negative emotions and don't let it rise up and turn into thinking.Instead go deeper into them and feel them fully.  Mental labeling happens automatically on the basis of conditioning your mind had. Have you noticed when you see some person or experience something, there is a small pause and then mind kicks in with the automatic mental labeling?Try it now: Look away from the screen and watch your inner self with high alertness. Did you notice a pause of no thought and then the 'heavy mind machinery' started, causing a taut feeling in your body and brain muscles? Did it feel as if resisting or judging what is?   Many people are not even aware of this automatic mental labeling or painful impulse because of the mental noise or because they consider it "normal". Similarly, we automatically judge or label people or a group of people. This is the biggest reason why it becomes easier to vilify people, because we have already vilified them in our mind by labeling or conceptualizing them. "To reduce the aliveness of another human being to a concept is already a form of violence" (Eckhart Tolle).  'She didn't have the decency to return my call', 'He gave me a bad review, I could lose my job', 'the soup is so damn cold, I am never coming to this place again', 'I have been feeling fatigued for a while now, do I have cancer?'.  How simple life would be without these mental stories. 'She did not call', 'He gave me a poor review', 'the soup is cold', 'There's a tautness in my body'."There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so." William Shakespeare.  When you notice yourself being taken over by mind or any egoic pattern, then smile, laugh and have fun with it.. For example make fun of yourself like 'I am in nut-mode','I have been possessed by ego' etc. Or replace mental noise with constructive content or actions. Its like channeling the reactions(negative energy) in a creative and constructive way to transmute them. It is highly recommended to read Stay Rooted in Beingfor more depth.   Thoughts and emotions is energy that arises in your consciousness. Since energy can only be transmuted, so practices like verbalizing, inner body awareness, breath meditation, etc. help transmute negative low frequency emotions to high frequency. Another reason why resistance is futile. Read Stay Rooted in Being for pragmatic practices. Allow, remain non-reactive and smile, even if it makes you do or say things you don't want to say or do. Learn from the past but don't feel guilty about it because then it becomes psychological pain.  Most of us don't know who we truly are. Trapped in this dream of life, seeing reality through limited view of sense perceptions and ruled by thoughts; without even knowing it's not us.That's the reality of the majority of people, i.e completely identified with mind and form. They are not even there. Feeling uncertain or thinking it's nonsense?  , Have you ever noticed that before you start running or any other challenging task, mind activity is high? For example thoughts like "this is going to be tough", "I don't wanna run", "this is a mistake" etc, will start arising in your space of consciousness. However, when you push through that initial static of thoughts and emotions by running for some time, then the thoughts from in the beginning change or disappear. If you had believed your mind in the first place, would you have run? The initial thoughts we get are what we are conditioned to think. This is why instead of fighting the conditioned thoughts, which on the contrary makes them stronger, channel reactive energy of thoughts to something constructive like replacing these thoughts with present moment anchors, making it fun and silly, constructive action, thoughts or content etc. As that's what reconditions your mind. Read Stay Rooted in Being and Become Mentally Flexible for more depth.   One of the reasons for high thought activity is because of the unreleased surplus energy in us. Cause mind acts out this surplus energy via thoughts. So some form of thorough physical workout helps a lot to release this surplus energy as physical exertion drastically reduces mind activity and forces it to surrender. So try different experiments and activities to force your mind to surrender.  The time is always now.Feeling regret or guilty about something you did or didn't do, enter now from there. Feeling sad because of some loss, enter now from there. Feeling resentment, enter now from there. Too excited or anxious, enter now from there. Feeling unforgivable or self pity, enter now from there.Again, even if you are going through a bad situation or stuck in past or future etc., what's stopping you to become present now? You have power only in the now. Suppose you forgot to be aware of your breath or inner body, can you become aware of it now? Instead of feeling guilty about it. Just forgive yourself and enter now from there.  Your mind might ask questions like 'So how can I allow thoughts and emotions?','What does it mean to watch your inner-self?', "What's 'enter now from there'?" etc and come up with mental answers to the questions on the basis of its conditioning. For example your mental answer could be: 'Watching means to just be silent and observe'(another concept). This might trigger another question 'So how can I observe?' and this might lead to another mental interpretation, until mind conceptualizes it with a notion that it will free you of the ego. Which is short sighted and doesn't work.   It's ok to have these concepts in the beginning(or use them from time to time) but realize that the words and concepts are no more than stepping stones to be left as quickly as possible.Finger (concept or thoughts) pointing to the moon (consciousness) is not the moon. You know who you are? You are the awareness(subject) that sees these thoughts, concepts and reactive thoughts (voice in head or objects)that uses the words like 'I' or 'you' and pretends to be you. “I am a hole in a flute that the Christ's breath moves through.....listen to this music”- hafiz  

practice inner acceptance.  start with little things.  give.  stay rooted in being.  recognize the interconnection between mind, emotions and body.  experiment.  see the suchness of this moment.  smile and laugh at it.  when you are stillness, what can you resist?,  force your mind to surrender.  enter 'now' from there.  free yourself from all concepts. 

 Do everything you can to avoid them. ; , If you can't go thirty seconds without stopping for breath start working out and getting some endurance training. You need to be able to last a good 3 minutes of solid fighting/grappling/wrestling.  No one fights to get the other person to submit. You fight to hurt people. Do you want to get hurt or go home safely?  , Unless you're a cage fighter and you can fight on the ground, avoid it. We will touch on this later  , Keep your elbows in and your fists near eye level away from your face to block side attacks. ,,, Get close to your target. Don’t stand arm's width apart from target. That’s where the punch will hurt the most. Get close. Try this, for example: walk up to a wall, put your fist about 2 inches (5.1 cm) away and punch the wall. Not bad, didn’t kill you right? Now, step back and punch the wall as hard as you can with a full extension of your arm. You didn’t do it, did you? It would have hurt like hell.  They come off with a little bit of force. The psychological effect of having an ear ripped off will stop most fights.  If they can't see. . . well, you get the point.  If you can't breathe, you can't fight.  They may be harder to control and have shorter reach, but they are strong, hard for an opponent to grab, and they pack a lot of force.  Don't pull on the hair because one, you aren't protecting your body, hence, them being able to punch you out, and two, they could push you down to the ground because with your arms up in the air and all the moving you aren't stable.  If you can break an extremity at the joint, you can plan on a fight being over right then and there.  A solid foot stomp on the top of your opponent’s foot will result in the immediate breaking of bones and you will almost certainly cause their foot to swell to the point of no return.  If you can, grab a hand, take a hold of it, the flip it in a big circle and twist it 180 degrees. Once in that position, you can manipulate the arm and break it easily.  Your collar bone has very little strength. About 7 pounds of pressure will snap a collar bone and the entire arm will drop like a load of potatoes.  It's a common misconception that groin attacks are only effective on men. On both men and women, this will cause severe pain. If it doesn't take your opponent down, it surely will reduce their fighting efficiency. However, beware of your opponent groin attacking you back.  A little tougher to break, but when they do, this really ends a fight.  Try to grab a hold of an arm, when you have it, use your forearm or palm to throw a sort of inverted punch. Try to land your blow onto the weaker underside of the arm, where your veins and arteries are. If you use your palm, keep your fingers pointed up.  A lot of people like to bite when they fight. Bad call. You can catch any number of diseases. If you should happen to get bit on your fingers, you can literally rip the bottom jaw off of an attacker with your own strength. Imagine your fingers are being bitten from the side, covering your smallest fingers. Manipulate your whole hand into the attacker's mouth and push your fingers down into the bedding of the tongue. That alone will warrant an attacker to let go. Don’t let them. Dig your fingers under their teeth in the small pocket your tongue hides in. Pull down and to the side. You will notice they forgot about fighting and are desperately trying to get your hand out of their mouth. Often times, they will focus both hands on pulling your one hand out. Use your free hand to grab a fist full of testicle or an ear. If you can give sharp jerks in a downward and outside motion, thrust away from their face. The bottom jaw might be able to handle three of those before it unhinges.  Not the best place to attack, but it's a preference from behind. If you can get a hold of the attacker’s neck, grab on for dear life and don’t stop squeezing until they pass out. This can kill them if you punch them.  A mild blow to the base of the back near the beltline will temporarily disable an attacker. A severe blow to the same spot will permanently incapacitate them from that point down on their body.  If you can grab the nose, do it. Snap it to the side. Punch it straight into the brain. Don’t worry, you won't kill anyone. That’s an Old Wives' tale. Also, a sharp thrust of the palm in a downward motion will have the same effect.  Act quick, you won't fight them off for long with only one hand.  The beverage you use will have different effects on the eyes (i.e. if you spit hard liquor into the eyes, you will have more time than if you used ordinary water). If you use chewing tobacco, the same effect can be achieved by spitting tobacco juice into your opponent's eyes.  Fight like your life depends on it. Be aware of your surroundings.  staplers, rocks, bottles, aerosol deodorants or sprays). They may seem harmless, but all can cause severe injury if used properly.  This gives the opponent the upper-hand to sucker-punch you. If the fight starts there, it finishes there. ,, This is a very effective technique, which can potentially cause a concussion. But be-careful as this can kill someone if done wrong. , Make it count. , If your opponent has a bleeding nose, you'll subsequently have time to throw punches.

 Use the shovel to put gravel into the grizzly, and shake it through the holes in the grizzly. Inspect all oversized rocks and other materials for possible gold nuggets, and toss anything that is not gold back into the stream.; , Squat down by the edge of the stream, and submerge a half-full gold pan in gently moving stream water between your knees. Point the pan riffles away from your body so that you can catch any gold that emerges over the pan's lip. Throw back any pebbles into the stream. Break up clay balls in case any placer gold is trapped inside them. When the water inside the pan clears up, the clay is gone and you can start panning.  Shake the pan sideways or in a circular motion while keeping it completely submerged underwater. Be on the lookout for heavy, unusually shaped or colored pieces that sink to the bottom of the pan. If you have gold, it will settle to the bottom of the pan.  If you see dark, heavy mineral grains, you are panning correctly. These minerals could contain precious and semiprecious stones such as magnetite, garnet, scheelite, zircon, cassiterite, and platinum, so look out for them as well as for gold.   As a general rule, if you find something heavy, keep it for later analysis. A geologist or miner will be able to identify the items you find.  Use a magnet to separate magnetic grains from everything else. Use tweezers to pick up possible small gold pieces. If you find any possible small pieces of gold, save them in a water-filled vial.  

position the grizzly over your gold pan.  prepare for the gold panning process.  begin panning for gold.  tilt the pan sideways occasionally to let sand and other small materials wash away.  do your final panning over a container so you don't lose any small gold pieces that could possibly be in your pan. 

 These are the cards that will be in each player's hand when the game starts. For now, deal the cards face down. When the game begins, each player will quickly flip the cards over and will look at his hand. The players should not look at each other's cards.   Speed is traditionally played between two opponents. Three- and four-way speed are popular, but require additional decks of cards.  The piles on either edge should have five cards in them, and the inside two piles should have one card each.   The piles on the outer edges are the side piles, and will be the reserve piles that each player will use to replace the two inside piles if both players run out of moves. The inside two piles are the active piles will be flipped over when the game begins. The players will then try to place appropriate cards from their hand of five cards onto this pile.  This is the pile that players will draw from after their hand of 5 cards has less than 5 cards in it. As soon as they are able to play one of the cards in their hand, they can draw for more cards from this pile. Each player has to draw from his own draw pile.  Each player can look at his hand of five cards to see if any of them can be placed on the middle cards in ascending or descending order. Note that each player should keep his hands hidden from the other player -- the open hand is displayed for your convenience.  On each of the cards in the active pile, you can play a card of one higher or one lower value regardless of suit (you can place either a ten or an eight on a nine, a ten or a queen on a jack, and so on). You can place as many cards as you want to at a time, and you do not have to wait for the other player to place a card down before you.   The ace can be played as a high or a low card. It can be placed above the king or below the two. This makes it so that the game can be played in a loop.  When you play a card, immediately draw another one from your draw pile. The only time this shouldn't happen is if a player runs out of cards in his draw pile; then, he should just try to play the remaining cards in his hand to win the game.  This will create two fresh cards in the center that will hopefully allow them to place one of their cards on them in ascending order. Any time no moves can be made, this process should be repeated. If this keeps happening and there are no cards left in the side piles, then the players should shuffle the cards in the center piles and place them face-down as the new side piles. Then, they can each flip one card over from these piles and continue playing.  to win the game. Some players don't think this is mandatory to win the game and that a player automatically wins if he runs out of cards. But this isn't nearly as much fun! Yelling "Speed!" makes for the perfect ending to this fast-paced game.   Typically, speed is played as a best-out-of-three game. The first player to win two games wins the set. But you can play for as many games as you like!  , This variation just adds one more rule to the game — not only can you place down cards of ascending or descending order, but you can also place the same card on top of another card of the same value. You can place your king on top of another king in the pile, your seven on top of another seven, and so on. This will make the game go by even faster because you'll have more options when it comes time to put down your cards.   Because this version makes the game slightly easier, it is also known as the "children's version."  , This can be a little tricky to pull off, but if you agree on this rule, it can raise the stakes of the game. With this variation, if you have a 3, 4, and 5, you can wait until you see a 2 or a 6 and then put down all three cards at once. You can surprise your opponent with a sneak attack that suddenly leaves you low on cards.  If you use the two jokers in your deck to play the game, then these jokers can serve as "wild cards." If you've got one, you can place it down on top of the deck at any time and then place another one of your cards over it — since it's a wild card, you can put any other card down over it at all. After that, just continue the game as normal. Don't be too eager to pull the trigger on those jokers, though. Wait until you can't make any other moves to put down the card so you make the best use of it.   Typically, when you use jokers as wild cards, you make the draw piles have 16 instead of 15 cards each. The joker has to be used when you have run out of moves with your other cards. You cannot draw from the draw pile if you still have a joker in your hand. The joker cannot be the last card you play. It cannot "top" a deck.  You can expand this exciting game to include more than just two players. If you want to have extra players, just create an extra pile of cards in the center. So, if you have three players, you should have three piles in the center for the players to place their cards on. You can still deal 5 cards to each player and distribute the rest of the cards evenly so each player has his own draw pile.   If you want to make things extra fun and exciting, then you can even use two decks instead of one when you're playing with four players. The extra cards will become part of the draw pile, allowing for even more combinations of play.  Though some people refer to the game of "Speed" as "Spit," this actually makes up a different, more complicated game with different rules. In this version of the game, the entire deck is split between two players, where each player has five stacks that each have one card face up, and 1-4 cards facedown. Each player has 11 cards face-down in a stockpile, and there are still two cards face up in the center of the game. The goal is for the player to shed all of the cards from his 5 stacks of cards, using cards in the stockpile when necessary.   The same rules -- placing cards over the cards in the center pile in ascending or descending order -- still apply, but the game is more complicated because each player can play the cards from the 5 stacks of cards instead of just playing the cards in his hand. If you really want to know how to play spit, see the instructions below for further clarification.  Though people often confuse the game "Speed" for the game "Spit," the latter is actually a more complicated version of the game, though the same principles do apply. The first thing you have to do is to split the deck in half so each player can begin to organize his piles.  If you're familiar with Solitaire or Patience, then 5 of the piles will be set up in a similar fashion. You may only have 5 face up groups. Each player should set up the stock piles and spit piles like this:    The stock piles:  Stack 1 has 0 cards face down and 1 card face up Stack 2 has 1 card face down and 1 card face up Stack 3 has 2 cards face down and 1 card face up Stack 4 has 3 cards face down and 1 card face up Stack 5 has 4 cards face down and 1 card face up    The spit pile:  Stack 6 is each player's spit pile and can be placed out on the side. These are known as the player's spit cards.  Each player should also say "spit!" as he or she does this. These cards will begin the spite pile, where each player will try to place cards of ascending or descending value from his or her stockpile.  When they play one of the cards in the 5 stacks, they can then flip a card that is face down into the empty space to create a new active spit card. Think of these 5 stacks as being each player's "hand". In this game, unlike in Speed, the players don't have a hand to hold.  When this happens, the players should draw a card from the stock piles and place them in the center of the pile at the same time to continue the game.  If the other player sees this and hits the center pile of his choice first, he gets it. The idea is to take the smaller pile, if there is one, so the other player is stuck with more cards. The player who does not slap the spite pile in time takes the other pile. Whoever gets his hand on the pile first gets it.   If neither player can play and one of the players has no spit cards left, then the other player has to spit alone into only one spit pile. This player can choose either of the piles, but then he has to keep spitting into only that pile for the remainder of the round.  Now, each player must take the remaining cards in his stockpile as well as the cards that he now owns from the spit piles and reshuffle them. The player should then place those cards into the set-up of 5 stock piles just as he did at the beginning of the game, using the remaining cards as his spit pile. One of the players may have more cards than the other. If one player doesn't have enough cards to create a spit pile after dealing all of the cards in the 5 stock piles, then there will only be one spit pile in the center of the game.  To win the game, a player must get rid of all of the cards in his stockpile and spit cards. Once a player has no cards left at all, he has won the game. This game can take a lot longer to play and win than "Speed," but the feeling of victory can be even sweeter!  

deal two players a hand of five cards each.  place four piles of cards face down in between the two players.  divide the deck in half and create a draw pile of 15 cards for each player.  start the game by flipping over the two middle cards.  each player should try to place the cards in their hand on the active piles in ascending or descending order.  each player should draw from his draw pile whenever he uses a card in his hand to make sure he always has five cards to play.  if both players can't play any of their cards, then they should both flip over a card from one of the side piles into the center piles.  when one player runs out of cards in his hand and draw pile, he must slap both piles of cards and say, "speed!",  play using doubles.  put down more than one card at a time in descending or ascending order.  use jokers as a wild card.  play with three or four players.  play spit.  split a deck of 52 cards into 2 equal decks.  have each player organize his cards into 6 piles into 5 stock piles and 1 spit pile.  begin the game by having each player flip a card from his spit pile into the center of the game.  each player should place any cards that are face up on one of the center cards that are of ascending or descending value.  the players should draw from the stock piles if they cannot use any of their cards.  when a player has played all of the cards in his 5 decks, he should hit the center deck he wants and gain it.  reshuffle the two spit piles to continue playing the game.  keep playing until one player wins by running out of cards. 

   Make your wording as clear as possible. For example, if you ask "Do you hear things that others can't?" and the patient says yes, it could mean psychosis, or it could mean that they have very good hearing. Consider the format. For people who have difficulty reading, it may be best to read questions aloud, and use pictures to supplement. Autistic people may struggle to understand and remember spoken words, so they can benefit from reading the questions.; , This may be done through direct observation, review of records or by interviewing people who know the individual.   Use this data in assessment design. It will help in knowing how to set up these variables and possibly rewards in a way which will attract the individual to participate fully. It will also indicate where, when and how to conduct the assessment to best obtain useful information for treatment planning.  If the session is too long, the participant may tire and lose focus, and you may lose keen observation due to the same.    Include the student in determining the length of the sessions. Use a clock or visual timer so the student may track the passage of time without asking multiple times. Inclusion in the process builds empowerment. Even without intention, many times people on the autism spectrum feel disempowered. It just happens by having a team of having so many adults making important decisions for them, even if the person is present at the meetings.  This may need to be altered depending on illness, other absences, and/or level of participation.  Show up on time, only interact to the degree allowed by the plan.   Remember that unless a part of the assessment, each unplanned interaction in some way alters the outcome of the assessment, or “skews the outcomes”.  Right after a session the information will be more detailed and complete than later on.   Be accurate in recording data. It is extremely important to be objective, to note when you might be somewhat subjective, and to be detailed. It is not always possible to record (video, auditory) the session. As such, the accuracy of what you record is paramount. Remember, you are the eyes and the ears for the rest of the treatment team. Make sure to clearly highlight information that pertains directly to the assessment question(s).  Length of the assessment may vary.   A person may be slower to engage, or there may be more information than anticipated thereby altering the time required to complete the assessment. If you are a professional conducting the assessment, you need to advise the team of your progress. If you are not a professional, but are part of a larger team, bring any changes in the assessment to the team first before making change.  Provide feedback to the person so they are included in the process. Gather every bit of information that has been recorded.  Break the report into sections such as:   Background to the assessment. Acknowledgment of the assessment questions. How the assessment was set up. Always include how the person presented on the first day. Interested or not, well groomed and dressed or not, communicative or not? The initial contact is important as it provides baseline information that will not otherwise be included in the report. Answer each assessment questions thoroughly, as well as anything that stands out as very significant that the questions did not cover. ,, If you are a consulting professional, ensure that the team has a direction to move in once the assessment is complete.   Provide suggestions and/or alternatives to treatment planning and development.  

determine your assessment questions carefully.  study available background information.  set time limits on the assessment sessions.  establish the tentative number of sessions.  be consistent.  record information immediately.  be flexible.  take time to share the results.  write a comprehensive, readable assessment report.  write a summary to the assessment.  ,  sign it, date it, distribute copies to team members.  ,  offer recommendations. 

 Kill Rate is the number of players on the opposing team that you kill in an amount of time. The clan with a higher kill rate than the opposing team usually wins the battle because they have wiped out more enemies in a shorter amount of time. If you want to win fights, the trick is to kill more enemies than you lose allies. In other words, get a higher kill rate than your enemy. Below I will explain how to improve KR and be more more successful at Clan Wars.; , There are three things that the best clans have. The first is having many high levels who are experienced fighters. Who is more likely to die, a low level or high level? Having too many low levels is detrimental as it increases the opposing clan's KR. The same can be said true about inexperienced fighters who tend to die early in fights without contributing to their clan. A clan with more high levels has the potential to achieve a higher KR. The second and third most important things that every clan should have is size and superior leadership and organization. If your clan is a lot bigger than the opposing team, it lets you overwhelm your enemy which gives the enemy a very low KR since they will be piled by many people. Size is very important especially in casual purple portal fights. Superior leadership and organization is also very important for winning battles and this can be a make it or break it for your team. Below I will list some of the ways your clan have better leadership or organization.  If you have ever been to a clan wars playoffs before, there is often someone at the start of the battle who says "fall in" and everybody follows that person. There should be at least 2-3 of these kind of people on your team. They should be high level, have clan wars knowledge, and be able to tank attacks from multiple people. A leaders job is to keep everybody together and call who to pile. A leader must choose wisely what to do and who to attack. That is why they have to be intelligent. The first person the leader calls to pile is very important and can even determine if your team wins or loses. Try to target someone who is by themselves and not in a giant cluster of white dots so players will clearly know who to attack. Binders also need to make sure they are constantly binding the people the leader chooses who to pile so they won't run into a cluster of white dots. Remember that piling is very important and if your teams knows how to pile well, you will win plenty of battles. You can also go for the leader first which is riskier but possibly better. More of that will be written below.  Your clan is sure to lose if your leader is piled and killed early and your teammates scatter. This allows the enemy clan to pick players off and not lose very many people. On the other hand, this is what you want to try to do to the enemy clan. If you can get them to scatter and not work as a team, then your clan will most likely win. There are various ways to do this. One way is to get several mages to bind the enemy leader before he can call who to attack, then quickly pile the leader before he can do anything. After that swarm the place where the leader died and form a giant purple cloud. If done correctly, the enemies should scatter and give you a strong head start to winning the war. You must also make sure that your leader is not piled and this isn't done to you.  This is a very hard thing to do and can always be improved upon. But the most important thing to learn is that your clan must stay together during the fight and do everything together. As mentioned earlier, when your clan spend the majority of a fight scattering, this will lower your KR and make it much easier for the opposing clan to kill you off. Piling is also very important and something that most F2P clans utilize. If your clan is piling someone, you pile them as well. If your clan runs north, run north as well. Do everything as a clan together. As I like to say, form a purple cloud on the mini-map. Enemy units are less likely to attack a cloud than a single dot and if they do attack, they will quickly be piled. Only run away if it is clear that the enemy clan has broken up the group. At this point, you should retreat and attempt to find other purple dots to group up with.  Every F2P Clan Wars clan should have mages who are capable of binding. This is important because if an enemy player is trying to get away, mages can bind them and this allows them to be piled easier. Also mages can hit through rune armor fairly easily which is also very important for piling. Mages can also cast curse spells at opponents which can increase the amount of damage an enemy receives by 5% which is quite useful. A good ratio to have is 1 binder for every 6 or 7 teammates. That means for a 30 person team, there should be at least 5 binders.  DD is when players stand on one spot. The advantages of using this method is that your players will stay together much more easier. The disadvantages is that it is more difficult to call who to pile so your team may attack random people. This method can work well if your clan doesn't have a good leader, has plenty of high levels, and if the enemy team attacks in small numbers at a time. First of all, to be successful with this method, you must make boundaries and tell each of your players not to cross those boundaries ever. This is because the whole point of DDing is to stick together and if a bunch of players start crossing the boundary, then they are going to be killed. For instance, on the turrets map tell your players not to get off of the turrets. Second of all, wipe out enemies who are near the DD spot or in the turrets. You will also need plenty of mages and rangers; especially if you're going with the turrets method. Another downside to the DD tactic is that if the enemies rush and overrun your team, your clan will scatter and without a specific person to pile, your clan will have a hard time recovering unless you regroup somewhere else.  The recommended food for f2p clan wars in order of usefulness is swordfish, anchovies pizza, lobsters, or salmon. With food, players are less likely to be killed earlier in a fight which is essential. If many of your members do not bring food, this increases the enemies kill rate while decreasing yours. Another item that clan members should bring is the expensive spices necklace obtained from completing the easy quest, Let Them Eat Pie. This useful item allows food to restore an extra 50 lifepoints. Also clan members should bring stat boosting potions. Bring at least one defense potion and another that corresponds to your combat class. For instance, if you're maging bring a magic potion and defense potion.  

understand the concept of kill rate often known as kr.  you must understand what makes a clan more likely to successful.  every clan should have a leader who calls piles.  when two clans meet and clash, this often determines which clan will win or lose the fight.  your clan must fight as a unit to be successful.  make sure your clan has plenty of mages.  another tactic to use is dding or standing on the turrets in the turrets map.  tell your clan to bring food and pots in a food-allowed battle. 

 Do this at least twice a day, for at least two minutes each session.Invest in a portable toothbrush and toothpaste if you frequently consume garlic or onion.  Brushing on its own only cleans just over half of the surface of your teeth, and thus it is important to floss, as well.You should ideally be doing this after every meal.  An antibacterial mouthwash containing chlorhexidine, hydrogen peroxide, or cetylpyridinium chloride will help to prevent bad breath. Many brands of mouthwash contain alcohol, which can dry out your mouth (a cause of bad breath), so avoid these brands if possible., The filaments on your tongue trap tiny particles and bacteria; the major proportion of odor-producing bacteria are found on the tongue. Thus, when you brush your teeth, also clean your tongue with a tongue cleaner or toothbrush., Using an irrigator or water pick cleans food particles from around and under your gums and between your teeth.If you aren't getting foods out through the methods listed above, they are rotting and festering in your mouth; a water pick will help to remove stubborn food particles.  

brush your teeth.  floss.  use mouthwash.  use a tongue cleaner.  use a water pick. 

 Modern—or show—Siamese are easy to identify. Their bodies have been bred for extreme qualities: modern Siamese are slim, angular, and have a deliberately skeletal appearance. The modern Siamese cat also has an elongated, thin neck and tail. The cats look elegant, and commonly appear in cat shows and competitions.Due to the rigorous breeding practices that went into breeding the modern Siamese, the breed is predisposed towards certain genetic illnesses. However, modern breeding practices have improved, and modern Siamese cats can live long and healthy lives. Like any purebred animals, Siamese can be susceptible to genetic health problems. These include congenital heart defects (including aortic stenosis) and amyloidosis: a disease which causes excess proteins to build up in the liver.; , Applehead Siamese, also known as traditional, are much less angular and thin than their modern counterparts. Applehead Siamese have thicker, stockier bodies, and their tails and necks are both thicker and shorter than those of the modern Siamese.Although modern and applehead are the two common types of Siamese cat, there are some that do not fall completely into either of these categories, but display a body type that borrows characteristics from both show and traditional Siamese.  As indicated by the name, the head of a traditional Siamese cat is rounded and almost apple-shaped. This is in stark contrast to the triangular, smaller head of the modern Siamese. The traditional Siamese will have a larger, heavier head that sits close to its body.Modern Siamese were bred for decades to have smaller and smaller heads, with increasingly angular features. Modern Siamese with wedge- or triangle-shaped heads are genetically susceptible to respiratory concerns, such as asthma and bronchial disease, and dental problems.

 Look online for showtimes and take your friend to see a movie you both want to see. Make sure to ask them first if they want to go to the movies. Get popcorn, soda, and candy, and have a fun day at the movies with your friend., If you live by the ocean, go to the beach. Spend the day relaxing by the water, swimming, and building sand castles with your best friend. If you don’t live by a beach, spend the day at your local swimming pool.  Find the nearest park and spend the day there with your best friend. You can lay in the grass, play on a play structure, or swing. Bring a soccer, basketball, or frisbee and play sports at the park too.You can also have a picnic at the park. Make your own picnic food or stop at the grocery store and get all your favorite snacks., Hiking is a great way to be active, have fun, and bound with your best friend. Hike in a place you have never been to or go to your favorite hiking trail. Go on a hike that has a destination like a waterfall or a beautiful view.

 When faced with a bigger opponent, you're going to be at a disadvantage from the start. Unless there's truly no other option, try to defuse or avoid physical violence at all costs. Do your best to make peace or simply walk away, if you can. There is no shame in running from a fight, especially if you don't know how it will turn out. Your opponent may be carrying a concealed weapon, or have friends lying in wait to gang up on you. Your primary goal should be getting yourself out of harm's way.Getting away from a violent situation before it erupts should be considered a victory. If a fight becomes unavoidable, stay relaxed. When you panic, your ability to gauge your surroundings and employ effective strategies shuts down.; , Keep your hands up to defend your head at all times. Your forearms should be held vertical and parallel, with palms turned inward toward your cheeks. Squeeze your fists together lightly until you’re ready to throw a counterpunch. Hunch slightly to bring your elbows down closer to your midsection to protect your ribs and abdomen from body blows.Don’t allow your guard to fall or get lax, even when you’re tired. Dropping your guard leaves you wide open for that one good shot which could mean the end of the fight. Make sure you assume a guard from which you can quickly and comfortably deliver punches or elbow strikes.  An aggressor who is bigger than you is also likely to be stronger, so it’s not recommended that you try to stop his attacks directly. Instead, stay mobile to swiftly escape from his punching range. Making him chase you will exhaust him, and with every missed attack he’ll lose a little more steam. If there’s no chance of getting a safe distance away, slide your head to the outside of the punch so that it passes by harmlessly, then immediately rush in and hit back.Evading is always preferable to blocking because it doesn’t require you to absorb force with any part of the body. Dodging a punch using only head movement is known in boxing as a “slip.” Slipping punches is an excellent way to avoid being hit while expending minimal energy., The bigger, stronger person always has the edge in a grappling match. Don’t put yourself in unnecessary danger by allowing your opponent to take hold of you. Keep just outside his reach until the time comes to counter, then capitalize and pull away again. If the fight goes to the ground, you’re looking at a scenario where you have even less control, as your speed, evasiveness and precision will go right out the window.If one of you takes the other down, or you happen to trip, get back to your feet as quickly as you can. You have a much better chance of outclassing a large opponent in a stand-up encounter., It’s unlikely that you’ll walk away from a fight with a larger opponent unscathed. You may have to eat a few punches if you get caught off guard or while you’re trying to find a way to slip inside. Keep this in mind and ready yourself mentally. Getting hit is no fun, but it could end up being much worse if you let it take you by surprise.If you do have to take a hit, try to do it on the shoulder or forehead, which is a harder, less vulnerable surface than the jaw or the rest of the face. Let your body sway in the direction of the punch to lessen its impact.During a physical altercation, your body will be flushed with adrenaline, which can keep you from feeling as much pain.  Move constantly to keep the larger opponent from grabbing you or landing strikes. Stay light and poised on the balls of your feet so that you can change directions quickly and keep him guessing. Since his reach is longer than yours, stay safely outside of it until you’re ready to move in and counter with a strike or takedown of your own.One method you could employ is to “dance,” or move in a circular motion around your opponent while staying outside of his striking range. When you sense a punch coming, duck, dodge make sure you’re too far away for it to connect.Since the legs are longer than the arms, becoming proficient at kicking can help overcome your opponent's reach advantage. Whatever you do, don’t let a larger opponent get their hands on you. One wrong move could end the fight in their favor.  When your opponent is least prepared, close the distance between you and move in close. This will neutralize his superior size and reach and put him in the right range to land some hard shots of your own. Finding the right timing and approach for getting in close is paramount for emerging victorious—you cannot win a fight with a bigger attacker by playing into his strengths.When negotiating range with a bigger opponent, the most important thing to remember is to stay out of the “danger zone.” This is the range at which he can hit you but you can’t hit him back due to his added reach. Move in suddenly after dodging a blow or feinting one of your own, or follow your opponent’s punching arm back as he retracts it.  One of the downsides of being taller and heavier is that it takes more effort to move, and as a result you run out of energy faster. Use this to your advantage. Keep slipping, dodging and moving constantly until your opponent begins to slow down. At that point, you can use your speed to slip into close range and unleash some punishing offense of your own.Working out to improve your cardiovascular conditioning can prepare you in the event that you need to be able to outlast an opponent’s onslaught during a fight. The strategy of allowing an adversary to tire themselves out before finishing them off has become known as the “rope-a-dope” principle. Muhammad Ali used this gameplan to win a championship bout with the larger George Foreman at the Rumble in the Jungle in 1974., If you suspect things are about to take a nasty turn, be the one to make the first move. End a tense standoff with a sudden, well-placed blow to the jaw or solar plexus (the soft, fleshy outer edge of the diaphragm beneath the sternum). Put everything you’ve got into the strike—try to put a stop to the fight in a single maneuver. If you’re successful, your opponent will be incapacitated and the altercation will be over. If not, you’ll at least already be ready for the ensuing brawl.Assess the situation as best you can before resorting to a surprise attack. In many cases, the aggressor might simply be worked up and won’t have any intention of actually getting into a physical dispute. Be certain that you’ve exhausted all other options first. Be careful when going for a sucker punch. If it misses or doesn’t do the trick, there will be no way to avoid a full-on fight.  It’s worth repeating that you shouldn’t try to stand and duke it out with a bigger guy. His reach and power will just be too much to handle. Take your time staying away from his strikes, waiting for an opening and then closing the gap and landing a hard shot. By alternating between defensive posturing and quick offensive bursts, you’ll eventually be able to wear him down.Don’t get impatient. You’ll start making mistakes, which could end up costing you dearly. Attack the body when you don't have a clear shot at your opponent's head. The solar plexus is a sensitive target that when hit just right can drive all the air out of an opponent's lungs and leave them gasping for breath. The ribs are also quite fragile, and can be broken with only a few pounds of force per square inch.  Unlike a boxing match, which has regulations about where you’re allowed to hit an opponent, all bets are off in a real fight. Target the most delicate areas of your attacker’s body to make every strike count. One well-placed blow is all you'll need to put your towering opponent out of commission. Most people won’t be expecting these types of attacks, so they’ll be left without a ready defense.Everybody has the same anatomical weakness, despite size differences. Strikes that target an opponent’s sensory organs will leave them temporarily stunned, enabling you to get away or follow up with a hard hit. An open hand slap to the ear is just as good as a left hook for shattering an opponent’s equilibrium, if not better. Hitting the nose can blind them momentarily by causing their eyes to well up with tears, which gives you an opportunity to throw a fight-ending punch. A kick to the groin will compromise their mobility and instantly take the will to fight out of them.  Let’s say you get taken down with your opponent on top of you, and you’re unable to climb to your feet. In this situation, scramble for a submission technique, a hold or lock that incapacitates an attacker by neutralizing a single part of the body. By applying a joint lock, armbar or choke, you may be able to do enough damage to put an end to the scuffle. No matter how big or tough someone is, they won’t be able to hurt you if they’re unconscious or have a broken arm.Apply a rear naked choke or triangle choke, depending on your positioning. Chokes disrupt an opponent's circulation or ability to breathe, causing unconsciousness. It only takes a firm hold and a few moments to put an opponent to sleep.Armbars are holds that apply pressure to the elbow joint or shoulder. They are effective against attackers who leave their arms extended momentarily after throwing a punch. As a bonus, disabling an arm means they can’t hit you anymore., Forget about honor or fairness: there are no rules on the street. You don’t know how badly you might be injured if you come out on the losing end of a fight, so you shouldn’t be discouraged from being vicious. Bite, gouge eyes, pull hair, chop the throat, bend fingers back, knee the groin and do anything else you have to do to survive.Turn objects around you, such as bottles, chairs, rocks, pens or even your cell phone into improvised weapons. In the best case scenario, the sight of you holding a weapon may be enough to make your attacker back down.To avoid escalating the violence further, make a run for it as soon as you have your opponent reeling.  

don't fight unless you have to.  keep your guard up.  dodge strikes rather than blocking them.  don’t wrestle with your opponent.  be prepared to take a punch.  use evasive tactics.  get in close.  tire them out.  use the element of surprise.  stick and move.  aim for sensitive targets.  go for submissions on the ground.  don’t be afraid to fight dirty. 

 Make your classmate less likely to want your answers by stressing your uncertainty about your work. You can express a lack of confidence in your answers, even if you are certain that they are correct, with a few practiced statements like “This unit is over my head, I doubt I got many answers right,” or “Do you understand the new ideas? I’m a little bit lost.” This may make other students think twice about trying to use your answers.   Minimize confrontation by presenting your work as incomplete or sloppy. You can say “I did the assignment wrong and haven’t been able to fix it,” or “I didn’t complete the assignment and I need to ask to copy someone’s work, too.” Discuss difficulties with your peers. Talk about the subjects that challenge you and in which you hope to improve rather than topics in which you excel. This can help you balance your reputation as a good student with a sense that your work may not be suitable for copying.  Accept your classmate’s interest in your work as a compliment. Peers may use praise in an attempt to manipulate you, so acknowledging the compliment can disarm their attempt to pressure you.Be prepared with a gentle reminder of the dedicated work you did to succeed, like “I’m flattered that you think my work is good, I study very hard.” If they continue to push, say “I worked hard and it is unfair that you get the answers without doing the work yourself.”  , You do not need to condone your classmate’s attempt to cheat, but you can try to understand why they feel the need take advantage of your success.Say to your classmates “I won’t give you my answers, but I understand how stressful this class is.” Emphasize that you are willing to help them manage the stress of homework.   Anticipate cheating around test times. Due to the high value placed on providing specific answers for assigning grades, stress can increase before major tests. This may make cheating seem more attractive. Before a test or major assignment, encourage a student that may ask you for answers or offer to study with them. This may reinforce proper study habits and discourage cheating.  

create doubt about your answers.  express appreciation.  sympathize with your classmate. 

   Most people can remember details that are important to them. Their own birthday, children's birthdays and amount of income are all things few people forget. This is because they have a personal interest in the date or amount. When using word games to recall information, make the words relate to, and revolve around, things you never forget.; , Words are much easier to remember than numerals.   Change numbers to words. Use words such as none, twice as many, dozen, half dozen, my age plus one and baker's dozen.  You are more likely to remember the words if they are funny to you. The crazier they are, the more memorable they will be.   Consider creating jokes to help remind you of the information.    Assign a letter to each word to create a new word or phrase.  People remember songs and poems, because rhymes are more easily remembered.   Create rhymes to remember names such as Hannah banana, silly Billy and Ella bella.  This works especially well with a lot of information that needs to be remembered in order, such as a speech.   Associate each step of your speech with a route or path that you travel often. Make the path and the order of the speech correlate. Group the information to be remembered into smaller chunks. Instead of trying to remember long pieces of information, use word games to group smaller pieces. This technique is often used with Social Security numbers by memorizing three numbers together in a group.    Associate shapes, sizes and even names with items. Remember twins in that one has an "oval shaped" face or recall the name Mike by associating him with a microphone.  Songs are often easier for people to remember than paragraphs of information, even though they may have the same number of words.   Turn the information into a fun song to sing. One great example of remembering information is the song "The funny bone is connected to the ...".  This works well when remembering how to spell words. Describing how the letters look is often a helpful way to remember. Consider the spelling of Mississippi which uses crooked letters and hump backs.  

make the words pertain to something personal to you.  begin by changing all of the numbers or dates to words.  create a humorous word game.  make an acronym to help remember items in a list.  use rhymes to make them stick in your memory.  create a road map.  use object associations.  sing it to remember it.  describe it.

 In your first group, you will breed your horses with others of the same type. The types you need are:   2 Strong horses (jumps while rearing) 2 Healthy horses (lots of health) 2 Speedy horses (incredibly fast) 2 Obedient horses (stays when you want them to, doesn't run in fear) 2 Muscular horses (very large body) 2 Beautiful horses (the two most beautiful horses) 2 Sneaky horses (runs very quietly) 2 Jumper horses (jumps extremely high); , This is the easiest stage of breeding. You just need to breed one horse with the other of its type. For example, a strong horse breeds with a strong horse. Repeat this until you have 8 baby horses. Afterwards, feed each of the babies to speed up their growth, and prepare 4 new pens.  This is the hardest breeding stage. For this, you have to breed one horse with a certain type of horse. They are:   Strong with Speedy Healthy with Muscular Stealthy with Jumper Beautiful with Obedient  , Now, breed the horses as shown here:   Strong and Speedy with Stealthy and Jumper Healthy and Muscular with Beautiful and Obedient  ,, If you did it right, you now have the ultimate horse! Now tame it, saddle it up, equip it with armor, and go off on your dream horse ride!  

test the horses for the qualities of the first 16 parents.  begin the breeding process.  pair up your next generation of horses.  prepare 2 new pens and feed the babies to speed up their growing process.  speed up the growth of the horses and make one final pen fit for horse royalty.  ,  breed the two offspring with one another. 

 Check out http://www.lissaexplains.com. It's a great website for beginners and a fun and easy way to teach yourself HTML!; , Ask yourself the following questions:  What kind of colors and/or graphics will fit your audience? Are you entertaining or trying to do business? Should the website be built for ease-of-use or design?  , Let's make your graphics first (or if you have your own already, skip to the next step).   To make a simple button, select New from the file menu. When the dialog box pops up, select 88 x 31 Micro Button from the Presets menu, or type in your own dimensions. Flood fill your button with your desired color, and add any desired text on now. Then go click the Effects menu, select 3D effects, and then Buttonize. You can mess around with the variables if you like, but once you're done, click okay, and viola. There is your button! To make a matching divider, mess with the picture size dimensions until it's the size and length you want and do the same thing! If you need backgrounds, search the web for royalty free images, there are tons of them out there.  Your website likely has more than one page, so let's make a frames page as your index.   Select New from the File menu, If a Templates dialog does not open, check to your right, and select More page templates.       Click the Frames Pages tab, and find the one that suits you and your website. For this example, we'll use the Banner and Contents.       To adjust the frame sizes, drag near the borders where the little arrow pops up, until the size you want is reached. If you want to keep the frames as resizeable in the browser, leave them alone. Otherwise, right click on the page and select Frame Properties. Down the the bottom, uncheck where it says Resizeable and browser, and presto.       To set the backgrounds on your newly created pages, right click anywhere in the white and select Page properties. Click the Formatting tab and select either the color you want or the image you wish to use. Generally, your menu bar (or button links) are stationary in one or more of the frames pages, with the center page being the one that displays your linked pages. To add your buttons, pick your menu page and select Insert, Picture, From File, and get it from your computer. Don't worry about linking right now, we'll get to that later. If you want to get rid of the scroll bar, right click on the page, and select Frame Properties. At the bottom where it says Options, choose between Never, If Needed, and Always. Add your homepage content. You may want to consider adding a link back to your homepage if there is any important information on it. Name your frame pages. Right click anywhere on each page, and select Frame Properties. Right at the top is Name; name them whatever you want (i.e. home, menu, banner, etc.) Save everything, making sure that you name your Frame set index (index is the page that your browser will automatically link to when opening a website).  Your linked pages are the pages that your buttons will be leading to. Select New and keep it a blank page; this will go inside the page you set as your homepage in the frame set. Add your content and save.  To link a button to your page, right click on it, and select Hyperlink. Find the page you created for this button, highlight it, and on the right hand side, select Target Frame...From here, highlight the frame you want your page to be displayed in, and hit ok. Test out your link; right click on your button, and select Follow Hyperlink...if you did it right, you linked page will be displayed where your homepage was before! Sometimes, FrontPage can be goofy, so if that doesn't work, try linking to Parent Frame instead.  To get links to open in a new window, do the same thing, only instead of selecting your home frame, select New Window.  The FrontPage help file should explain it pretty well. Once you start doing this more and more, you'll find that all those things you thought you couldn't do, you can, and making really great websites will be a breeze.

 A Korean folk game similar to wrestling, it is extremely popular during the festival. Two competitors wrestle in the center of a sandpit and try to knock the other person over by using strength, skill and intelligence. It is a one on one tournament and the last person remaining wins the game.  This is a folk dance especially performed by women. They usually link arms and dance in a circle under the moonlight.  "So" and "Geobuk" literally mean "cow" and "turtle" in Hangeul. This celebration is a ritual performed by two people wearing a cape made of hanji and running around the local area as a cow and turtle, asking for foods from neighbors. The foods are often shared with relatives who can't afford Chuseok meals.  

play ssireum.  perform the folk dance kanggangsullae.  perform sonori or geobuknori. 

 Nuts, such as walnuts and almonds are an excellent source of protein and can actually help to lower cholesterol. Nuts have a number of nutritional benefits and contain unsaturated fats, omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and vitamin E. They can be purchased year round and are typically harvested in the fall and early winter months.You can eat nuts on their own as a healthy afternoon snack, or add them to your salads, granola, or yogurt.  Wild salmon contains omega-3 fatty acids, which can help decrease your likelihood of developing heart disease. Salmon also contains high levels of selenium, an antioxidant that can boost heart health. Most major grocery stores will contain a fresh seafood section year round and you should be able to purchase salmon during the winter months., Try adding a plain yogurt to your regular diet. Yogurts are an excellent source of calcium and it can actually help to decrease high blood pressure.Yogurt is a delicious, fast, and easy breakfast staple. You can eat it on its own or mix yogurt with your favorite frozen fruits and granola.  During the colder months, many people will gravitate towards sweets and other comfort foods. Although these snacks are delicious, they can have harmful consequences on your health. Refined sugar can actually lower the functioning of your immune system.Avoid eating pre-packaged sweets and candies and instead, opt for natural sugars that are found in syrup, fruits, and honey.  

try a variety of nuts.  eat salmon.  enjoy yogurt.  avoid refined sugars. 

 One of the most common ways to eat chia seeds raw is to sprinkle them over or mix them into other dishes. Stir them in any wet food to turn the dry seeds gelatinous and mushy, which will help them blend into the food less obviously.   Add chia to your breakfast by sprinkling 1 or 2 Tbsp (15 or 30 ml) of chia seeds over oatmeal, yogurt, or breakfast cereal. For a healthy snack or light lunch, stir 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of chia seeds into a cup of cottage cheese. Mix chia seeds into wet sandwich ingredients. Use tuna salad or egg salad for savory sandwiches, or peanut butter or hazelnut spread for sweet sandwiches.; , If the food is dry, the seeds will stay crunchy, which some people prefer. Even on wet foods, a sprinkling of seeds at the top may not form a gel if not mixed in.   Sprinkle the seeds over any type of salad. Decorate pudding with a dash of chia seeds.  This is especially helpful if you have picky eaters in your household that may otherwise scoff at the notion of consuming these tiny seeds.   Mix chia seeds into potato salad or cold pasta salads. Add 2 tbsp (30 mL) of chia seeds to a large serving bowl of potato or pasta salad and stir thoroughly.  Mix 2 Tbsp (30 mL) chia seeds into your favorite granola bar recipe. For a no-bake recipe, stir the seeds into 1 cup pitted, blended dates, 1/4 cup peanut butter or other nut spread, 1 1/2 cups rolled oats, 1/4 cup honey or maple syrup, and 1 cup chopped nuts.Spread this mixture on a pan and harden in the fridge. You may toast the oats before adding to add a different flavor, or explore other granola bar recipes that require baking.  Add chia seeds to pureed fruit. More chia seeds will create a gelatin, while fewer will create a jelly. You may need to experiment with different amounts until you find a ratio best suited to your type of fruit and preferences.   Roughly speaking, 1 1/2 cups (375 ml) of pureed fruit and 1/2 cup (125 ml) chia seeds mixed together create a chunky jam.  

mix the chia seeds into oatmeal, yogurt, or other wet foods.  sprinkle chia seeds over foods to keep the seeds crunchy.  hide chia seeds in raw one-dish meals.  make granola bars with chia seeds.  create flavored chia gelatin or jelly. 

 This is the most common sign. The light is much,much brighter than it usually is, that means it is within minutes of burning out.; ,, The light is dimmer than usual, or doesn't turn on. It could be that it blown out already, you are too late.  The light takes a long time to start up. This means either a bad electricity current, or that it is going to burn out immediately.  The light flickers, this may mean it is badly connected/screwed in, or that the connection is connecting, and splitting, probably already burned out.  A fluctuating brightness definitely means it is about to blow up. Disconnect or switch off immediately.  

watch for an increase in light brightness.  listen: a strange squealing will come from the bulb, or a buzz, this signifies vibration that can cause the connection to break and fail.  ,  notice dimming.  observe how long it takes for the light to start up.  watch for flickering.  notice for light fluctuations. 

 It's probably a better idea to find a seat before you get your food. This is because if all the seats are full after you've collected your food, you're going to have to either eat standing up or walk around looking for a seat for quite some time. Also, some restaurants send waiters to your table, so it's required that you find a seat. At some restaurants, there will be a hostess who will direct you to your seat.; , The menu should already be on your table but if it's not, or there are not enough menus for everyone, ask a member of staff for one. The menu includes everything that the restaurant sells and also states their prices. Have a look and see if anything interests you then decide what you're going to buy.  This can be done by simply getting a passing waiter's attention or waiting until they come to you. Once they arrive, tell them what you'd like to eat. Make sure that they've written down the correct foods so you don't end up with something that you didn't want.   Never click your fingers to get their attention, the waiter will find it very rude and offensive. Remember that they are normal people with jobs, not your slaves.  At some restaurants, they cook the food from scratch as soon as they get your order. This means that it might take some time for your food to get to you. Just be patient, your food should arrive in under half an hour. If it hasn't arrived, tell someone. They may have forgotten about your order, or it might just be a busy day. 

find a seat.  look at the menu.  call the waiter over.  wait for your food.  enjoy!  

 Sulfates are notorious for drying out hair. Using a sulfate-free shampoo on your relaxed hair can help combat the dryness and lead to less frizzy hair. These kinds of shampoos typically use natural oils (like coconut oil) as a base rather than a harsh cleanser.Look for ingredients like coco glucoside, lauryl glucoside, decyl glucoside, capryl glucoside, and disodium cocoyl glutamate. Consider using sulfate-free shampoos like World Clean Hair & Skin Cleaner, Nature Clean Pure-Sensitive Shampoo, or Yarok Feed Your Volume Shampoo.; , These kinds of products help keep your relaxed hair moisturized by closing the hair cuticles that are lifted by the relaxer process. Moisturized hair is less likely to be frizzy.Look for products that include aloe vera juice, lactic acid, or citric acid to help tame the frizz on relaxed hair.  Frizzy hair is usually the direct result of dryness. To avoid this, try spraying your hair with a liquid product containing protein and amino acids – like Ouidad Botanical Boost or ApHogee Keratin & Green Tea Restructurizer Spray. Then add a moisturizing agent like coconut oil to seal in the moisture.These products can be used as often as needed, whenever your hair seems frizzy or dry.  Overexposure to direct sunlight can lead to dry hair and frizz, especially with relaxed hair. Try to avoid being out in the sunlight for long periods of time to avoid the frizzy effects.If you must go out into the sunlight for an extended period of time, try to wear a loose-fitting headscarf or hat to protect your hair from the damaging effects of the sun.  Vigorously rubbing your hair with a towel after showering can cause tangles and breakage that often leads to damaged and frizzy hair. Try gently squeezing the excess water out of your hair by twisting it slightly inside the towel, rather than rubbing your hands on it roughly.Try using a clean cotton t-shirt instead of a bathroom towel to dry your hair. The fabric is much softer and gentler on your hair. This can help prevent breakage and frizz.  Brushing your hair can cause your strands to tangle up or break off. The smaller teeth of the brush apply too much pressure to your hair, and more breakage leads to more frizz. Instead, use a wide-toothed comb to comb through your hair and prevent tangles.Small-toothed combs can be similarly damaging, so try to avoid these too.  A relaxing product should only be applied by a professional, as improper application can lead to serious hair damage. Go to a professional salon with a qualified hairstylist, preferably one with good online reviews or recommendations from friends.If you apply relaxers at home and it damages your hair, this can lead to more breakage and, as a result, worse frizz in your hair.  If you let your relaxed hair get too long, the tension can cause it to break. More breakage means more frizz for your hair. Make sure to consult with your hairstylist about how often you need to cut your hair, or what length is best for maintaining healthy, strong strands.If you start noticing more breakage than usual, it might be time to consider a shorter haircut – or at least a trim.  A healthy body does a better job at producing healthy hair. Take care of your body and try to minimize the stress in your life in order to prevent frizzy relaxed hair.This means that you should drink plenty of water and exercise regularly. You should also consider taking vitamin supplements like a daily multi-vitamin and an Omega-3 Oil.  

use sulfate-free shampoo.  try acidic leave-in conditioners.  moisturize your relaxed hair regularly.  avoid extended sun exposure.  dry your hair carefully after showering.  use a wide-toothed comb to prevent tangling.  get relaxers applied professionally.  monitor your hair length.  take care of your body. 

 You need to make sure your squirrel has a healthy, balanced diet. As squirrels are not traditionally kept as pets, this can be somewhat tricky.   Do not attempt to feed a baby squirrel on your own. Baby squirrels need specific vitamins and minerals. Feeding a baby squirrel formula or milk could result in the squirrel dying. Take your baby squirrel to a vet or wildlife rescue as soon as you can. The workers there will know how to feed him properly. In the event you take him back home with you, you can learn how to care for the baby online at TheSquirrelBoard.com. They do make specially designed food for squirrels. It can be tricky to find, however, as it may be sold at your local pet store. Some states do not allow people to keep squirrels as pets. You may be able to order squirrel food online, but it might take a few days. In the event you cannot get squirrel food quickly, TheSquirrelBoard.com has recipes to make temporary formula. , Keep a bowl of water in your squirrels cage or enclosure. Squirrels need plenty of water for their health and wellbeing. You can either leave water in a bowl or use a bottle, like you would in a hamster cage. If you're getting a bottle, make sure you use a glass bottle. Some squirrels chew through plastic.If you're giving water to a baby squirrel, make sure any bowls you use are not too big. You would not want a baby squirrel to accidentally drown in his water bottle. You can place rocks or marbles at the bottom and fill the bowl to just halfway up to the marbles so he doesn’t drown.  If you found a squirrel in the wild, he may be injured. You should carefully assess a squirrel for injury and get him veterinary care if you see any injuries.   Find a safe spot in your home with good lighting. Stay away from children or other pets. Wear heavy, protective gloves when handling a wild animal. You should also wear a long sleeve coat. If a squirrel has not been handled before, he may bite or scratch. If you are bitten/scratched, rabies is NOT A PROBLEM. Squirrels are cleaner than most other animals. Just rinse out the cut and go about your business. Keep a basin of warm water and a few clean washcloths on hand. Check the face, nose, and mouth for dried blood. If you see any parasites, like fleas or ticks, remove them. Parasites should be killed if still alive to avoid infecting other pets in your home. If you need to wash any blood, wring out the rag thoroughly and move it gently over the squirrel's fur.Pay attention to your squirrel's limbs. Lets and feet may be twisted awkwardly or limp. Baby squirrels are especially prone to injury from falling out of a tree or nest.If your squirrel is injured, contact a wildlife rehabber and/or vet IMMEDIATELY.  Squirrels need a lot of exercise. If you plan to keep your squirrel for awhile, you need to make sure he spends time building his muscles.   Allow your squirrel access to one room of your house for at least an hour a day. Make sure you remove anything breakable or anything you do not want damaged. Allow your squirrels to run, climb, and play in this room.Do not allow the squirrel outside without a cage. Hawks and other predators are faster than you and can make a meal out of the baby before you can react. Also, the baby may get spooked and run away, to never return, and thus die due to not knowing how to fend for himself. If you're keeping your squirrel longer than a week or so, install some perches in his cage. As stated earlier, bird perches work well for a squirrel cage. They should come with manufacturer's instructions for set up.  

feed your squirrel a proper diet.  provide plenty of water.  check your squirrel for wounds and injuries.  encourage exercise. 

 As a Rock-type, it is weak against grass, Fighting and Ground-type Pokémon. The other half - water - also makes it weak against electric types.; , Binacle is not immune to a particular type of attack but will take half damage from types such as Normal, Flying, Poison, Fire, and Ice.  

avoid using binacle against pokémon types.  battle pokémon types that binacle will take less damage from. 

 You can also use a large piece of cardboard on any hard surface like concrete. The main idea is that you'll be able to slide easily around the surface of the material.       ; , Breakdancing is truly a sport that requires physical exertion and athletic moves. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes.  Pick music with an upbeat, steady rhythm and a flow that you can feel. The most important aspect of the music is that you feel inspired and energized by it.  One of the first things any boy should learn is the difference between "breakdancing" and "Bboying". Bboying is the first term made to describe the dance; it's usually the term used when in the community. The term "breakdancing" was invented by the mainstream media in the 1980s to market the dance. Recently, serious performers have tried to reclaim the name "Bboying" for their performance.          The dance is called B-boying whether the performer is male or female. But when describing a certain individual, there's Bboy (male breaker) and B-girl (female breaker). All breakers have a nickname, such as Bboy Darkness, Bboy Cloud, etc. At first, this shouldn't be too important, but it is in the long run when you want to gain a better hold of who you are as a dancer and gain recognition in your community.  Teched in the breakdancing world means varied. It is used to describe the six- or four-step movements a performer is doing on the ground. When a B-boy's movements are heavily "teched," they are very complex and distinct.         

seek out an open tile, linoleum, or hardwood surface.  put on athletic shoes.  choose your hip hop beats.  know the basic terminology.  know the term "teched." 

 Create your first mat in a light color, such as white, that will highlight your photo. Choose a smaller size, such as a 1/4 or 1/8 inch (0.6 or 0.3 cm) border.   Make a larger photo mat in a complimentary, but darker, color. Make it 1/4 to 2 inches larger than your first photo mat. You will need to double the border measurement and add it to your last mat's dimensions before cutting the new mat.  With this technique, you will want a small bordered mat, a larger bordered mat and a smaller bordered mat on the outside again.   Measure and cut 3 mats. The first mat should be 1/8 inch (0.3 cm) larger than the photo on all sides. The second mat should be a 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) larger on all sides than the first mat in a different color. The last mat should be 1/8 inch (0.3 cm) larger than the second mat on all sides in the same color as the first mat. Glue the mats together and then affix the photo. This mat may need extra time to dry. There are many variations in sizes and shapes for this mat.  Use the same process to create mats with decorative paper; however, you will need to be more careful when working with decorative paper so that it does not rip.   Alternate using cardstock and decorative paper matting for a beautiful decorative effect. Use less glue on decorative papers so that they do not warp.  Cut your photo to be 3 inches wide and 3.125 inches high (7.6 by 7.9 cm). This is the standard size of a Polaroid print.   Cut a white mat to be 3.5 inches wide and 4.25 inches (8.9 by 10.8 cm) high. Center your photo so that it is 1/4 inches (0.6 cm) from the top. Write a memo about the photo on the bottom white portion, just as you would with a Polaroid photo.  When you measure and cut your mat, make the border measurement several inches wider than it is tall.   When you center your photo on the mat, make sure it is even on either side of the photo. Use this space to draw, add stickers or add jewels.  

begin to double mat your photos.  create a triple photo mat.  replace your cardstock mats with decorative mats.  create a polaroid photo mat.  create an embellished mat.

 You may want to discuss hypnotherapy with your doctor before you seek treatment. Not all health professionals will be aware of or supportive of hypnotherapy as an alternative treatment. However, if your doctor is interested in the clinical effects of hypnosis, they may be able to help you obtain treatment.Your doctor may be able to refer you to a reputable therapist in your area that uses hypnotherapy. Say to your doctor, "I read about how many medical professionals are using hypnotherapy to treat IBS. What do you think about that?" or "Doctors are using hypnotherapy to treat addictive disorders. I thought that might be a good fit for me. What are your thoughts?"; , There is no regulation for hypnosis. This means that not every person who is “certified” or offers hypnosis therapy can be trusted. The best way to ensure that you are getting proper treatment from a professional is to look for a licensed psychologist, therapist, psychiatrist, social worker, or other mental health professional who has training from reputable institution. Search for one who is interested in hypnotherapy.   Experts who use hypnotherapy may not be available in your area. You may need to search the internet or professional therapist associations to locate one near you. Make sure the therapist has training in medicine or psychology. Ask if they are licensed in your state, and where they got their degrees, training, and licenses. Find out if they are members of professional organizations. Discuss their experience with hypnotherapy and how long they have been performing it.Ask your doctor, hospital, or clinic for a referral to a hypnotherapist. Talk to any friends and family to see if they know about any hypnotherapists in your area. Search online to find therapists who specialize in hypnosis, and read any reviews about the therapist from others.  If you are having trouble finding hypnotherapists in your area, you may want to contact a professional organization. There are organizations dedicated to hypnotherapy where you can find information, studies, benefits, and practicing professionals.The American Society of Clinical Hypnosis and The International Medical & Dental Hypnotherapy Association have websites where you can find information about hypnotherapy. The American Psychological Association lists addresses, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers for various hypnosis organizations.  Only seek hypnotherapy if you are open to the idea or believe in its effectiveness. If you think hypnosis is stupid and won’t work, you will more than likely receive no benefits from it. To get to the hypnotic state, you have to allow yourself to sink into the deep state of relaxation.Some people are more susceptible than others. Those who are the least susceptible are people who are overly skeptical or resistant.  The therapist will start the session by helping you get to a relaxed, calm state where your mind is focused and open. They may talk to you in a calm, soothing voice as they vocally lead you to a place of relaxation. They may have you think of certain images to help promote relaxation.Part of getting into a total state of relaxation is feeling secure where you are. This is why it is very important for you to trust your therapist. For example, your therapist may ask you to close your eyes while listening to calm music. They will count back from ten, asking you to relax your muscles more and more with each number. You will let the tension release from your body. Then, you may be asked to think of a serene lake and let your mind mirror that calm state.  One of the keys to hypnotherapy is using imagery in your mind. During hypnosis, you may be put into a relaxed, calm state where your mind is focused. You will visualize something, often a concrete image of your condition, and then work on changing that image in your mind from something negative to something positive.For example, if you suffer from chronic pain, you may be asked to visualize your pain. You may imagine that your pain is a large throbbing red ball. In a hypnotic state, you will be asked to think about your pain as something different, such as a less imposing, threatening thing. Your mind may reimagine the pain as a small pool of water or a small blue ball rolling slowly across the floor.  Another part of hypnosis is opening your mind in that focused, relaxed state to suggestions. These suggestions are given to you by a licensed professional. Before the hypnosis, you and your therapist will discuss your goals and what you want to be suggested while in your hypnotic state.You are always in control of what is being suggested to you. Hypnosis is not a form of mind control. This is one reason it’s important to find a hypnotherapist who is qualified and that you trust. For example, while in a hypnotic state, your therapist may say, “You are not interested in cigarettes. You don’t want to pick up a cigarette. You do not have the urge to smoke.”  , Hypnosis may also provide the opportunity for you to figure out some of the underlying problems that may be stopping you from doing things or holding you back. In a hypnotic state, you may be able to revisit past events and experiences to understand yourself and habits better.Hypnosis can help you stop censoring yourself and instead open yourself to things you may usually ignore or push deeper into yourself. For example, your therapist may ask you to go through your mind and find any memories that you may find uncomfortable in your normal state. You can calmly reflect on those memories and observe them in a safe way. When you get out of your hypnotic state, you and your therapist can discuss the memory and the impact it may have had on you.  Studies have shown that hypnotherapy can help achieve deeper, better sleep. You can listen to a hypnotic suggestion tape before bed to help calm and relax your mind, then fall asleep. Those who are susceptible to hypnosis may find that they sleep better after using hypnotherapy before bed.Hypnotherapy may be a technique for people who have trouble sleeping. This can be a way for them to fall asleep and get more rest. Hypnosis has no side effects, unlike medication you take to sleep.  Hypnotherapy has been used with some patients who suffer from IBS. Studies conducted have shown that people with IBS had less symptoms and continued to see improvement for years after undergoing hypnotherapy. Patients were given hour long hypnotherapy sessions for 12 weeks.In hypnotherapy for IBS, you may be asked to visualize your intestine, which you see as a red inflamed tangle. In the hypnotic state, your therapist may suggest that you re-envision your intestine into something positive. You change your image to a pink, smooth rope, which helps your mind overcome symptoms. Talk to your doctor about using hypnotherapy. If your doctor is skeptical, contact a therapist or hypnotherapist to discuss how hypnotherapy may help your IBS.  Hypnotherapy has been used to manage chronic pain associated with fibromyalgia, arthritis, and cancer. Hypnosis may also help with migraines.Hypnosis works towards helping you let go of negative emotions and stress that can sometimes be associated with chronic pain. It also helps you feel more empowered as you learn to take control away from the pain.Hypnosis helps refocus your attention away from the pain and instead puts you in control of your mind, where you lessen the importance of the pain.  Hypnotherapy is used to help with anxiety associated with medical procedures, like surgery and giving birth. Hypnosis is aimed to help reduce fear and pain in these situations. Psychologists are starting to use hypnotherapy in the treatment of anxiety disorders, depression, and phobias.Hypnotherapy may be helpful to help nervous habits, like biting your nails. Suggestions during the hypnotic state may help you overcome your phobias.  Hypnosis can be used to help with weight loss and overeating. Along with a weight management plan, hypnosis can help you change your attitude about weight loss, diet, and exercise. It can also help you learn how to manage your weight as you work towards your goals.Hypnosis can also help with self-esteem and body imagine. Hypnosis may help you accept your body at each stage of your weight loss.  Hypnosis may be beneficial to children who suffer from certain nervous disorders. For example, hypnosis has been used to help with bed-wetting, stuttering, thumb sucking, phobias, sleepwalking, and even confidence issues. Children generally respond well to hypnosis.Hypnosis may help children uncover misunderstandings and understand what really was said or meant. Hypnosis may be helpful in behavioral problems in children and teenagers.  Hypnosis is also used to treat other conditions. These conditions include habit disorders, like smoking, skin conditions, hemophilia, hot flashes nausea, and vomiting. If you have a condition you’d like to try alternative treatment for, consider discussing the possibility of hypnotherapy with your doctor.Hypnotherapy won’t be appropriate for all conditions. Discuss it with your doctor and a trained hypnotherapist.

 You’ve built the interior of your hutch, now it’s time to start fortifying it a little more.  Cut lengths of 2”x4” lumber to measurements that are slightly larger than the cage itself. Remember, the cage has to fit in the frame.       Using hammer and nail, construct the frame around the cage.       Attach metal L-brackets to the inside corners or the frame for the cage to sit on. This will protect the wood from direct contact with cage.  You can make your hutch as tall as you like, but remember that if you’re putting it outside, you want to keep it about 4 feet (1.2 m) off of the ground to protect the rabbits from predators.  Cut the 2”x4” lumber to your preferred length.       Make sure the legs are all the same length or your hutch will be wobbly.       You can also use larger pieces of wood, like 4”x4” lumber, if you want sturdier legs.   Turn the frame upside-down.       Nail the legs to 4 corners of the bottom of the frame. Make sure they are spaced evenly.       Turn the frame right side up and make sure the hutch stands firmly in place.  You can easily just rest the cage in the frame now, you should be able to remove it with ease.   You can nail the cage to the inside of the frame with braces if you’d like it to remain in the hutch permanently or sit more securely        , Now that the cage is inside the hutch, you need to give it a little more protection.  Measure the sides of your frame and cut two pieces of plywood so that they’ll adequately cover each side.       Nail each side down       Do the same for the back of the hutch.       If you’d like to give your rabbits more ventilation, don’t nail the sides down, but attach them with hinges so that they can be opened and closed.  You’re almost done! Your rabbits have everything but a roof over their heads.  Measure out and cut a piece of plywood that will completely cover the top of your hutch.       Nail it down securely to the frame.       Add shingles, metal roofing, or plastic to the top of the roof for extra protection.        

create a frame for the cage to sit on.  create the legs.  attach the legs to the frame.  put the cage in the frame.  put the sides on the frame.  build the roof. 

 Applying makeup to the black eye while it is still swollen could irritate the skin and cause skin redness.   Additionally, the cosmetics used to conceal your black eye are likely to wear off as you apply cold packs to the injured area, making application prior to treatment fairly pointless. Wait until you have entered the warm compress stage of treatment before applying any makeup to the injured area, and apply makeup as little as possible. If you feel you need to cover your eye when you need to leave the house or if you are having people over, that's okay, but when you're just at home on your own, you should avoid applying makeup.  For best results, use a liquid corrective concealer in a yellow or green shade.Liquid corrective concealers are easier to apply and blend than most creams and require the use of less pressure on the skin.   You must use a corrective concealer first before using a standard concealer if you wish to disguise the black eye. Standard concealers match the tone of your skin and can only blend uneven tones together. Corrective concealers rely on the principle of complementary colors to correct discolored portions of skin. A yellow concealer generally works best for a black eye in its early stages, when it appears to have deep purple undertones. As the black eye lightens and takes on more red tones or yellow-brown tones, you may need to switch to a green corrective concealer. Apply the corrective concealer with your fingers. Use your fingers to dab specks of corrective concealer all around the blackened area of your skin. Use light pressure to gently and carefully blend the concealer into your skin, covering the entire damaged area.  A normal concealer can blend any uneven shading caused by the corrective concealer.  The two concealers should be enough to hide your black eye without any additional make-up. If you want to continue with your standard make-up routine, however, you can do so.         

wait until the swelling goes down.immediately after you receive the injury, your first priority should be to begin the healing process.  choose a corrective concealer.  follow with your normal concealer.once the corrective concealer has dried, use a normal concealer that matches your skin tone over it.  apply additional make-up only as desired. 

 Focus on 3 sets of 8-10 and hit each leg group. The goal is to work the muscles in ways that will maximize their ability to generate power over extended periods as well as to work stabilizer muscles that are under-trained in most runners. 3 sets of 8-10 works the body past pure power lifting (creating phosphate energy), but remains within the range for maximum strength benefits. Lifting helps extend the potential to increase power, which increases potential stride length, and thus the potential to run faster, especially if lean muscle mass and not bulk is added. Replace every 4th lifting day with plyometrics to ensure maximal conversion of strength training to explosiveness and fast running.   Emphasis needs to be placed on abductor/adductor exercises to help prevent injuries from overpronation and knee tracking issues (i.e. imbalances causing the knee to not glide on the patellar joint and instead irritate the cartilage), including but not limited to IT band syndrome, shin splints, tendinitis, etc. Example Schedule: Day 1=Squats, Abductor, Adductor, Calve raises. Day 2= Lunges, Leg Extension, Leg Curl. Make sure to include core, including back extensions and abdominal crunches as well as some chest and shoulder exercises to assist with form. Other lifts that should be included focus on the lower back and hip flexors, muscles that are often ignored. Deadlifts, Split-Squats, Glute-Ham Raise, Straight Leg Extensions, and barbell step-ups onto a knee high platform are great ways to develop strength in these muscles. Lifting sessions should be less than one hour. To do this, utilize circuit type training approaches (i.e. while taking rest from squats, do pull-ups). Recovery should include a protein/carbohydrate snack within one hour to maximize anabolism (protein assists in the ingestion of carbohydrate. A balanced diet should contain enough protein, so protein shakes are unnecessary - the body can produce a majority of amino acids). A nice glass of chocolate milk is ideal. A non-lifting way to achieve the same objectives is to incorporate soccer or Frisbee or basketball once a week to help work on stabilizer muscles, explosiveness, and reinforce turnover. Football players rarely have an issue with over striding or slow turnover for a reason.; , The anaerobic system can reach 95% of its potential training for 6 weeks. Therefore, the only training that should be done in the summer should focus on aerobic conditioning and strength training. This can either be a cross country training program, or can be something consisting of the following:   One long run per week to build up oxidative enzymes (up to 15 miles (24 km), but no more than 1/4 of weekly mileage), 2 days of hill sprints including form drills (lead-yard bounding is recommended, see images and search for Lydiard foundation), 2 days of lifting, and just plenty of mileage until you are up to at least 30 miles (48 km) per week. Mileage is very important to most 800 runners. While elite sprint types can normally get away with 30-40 mpw, most elite 800 runners need to build base at 50 mpw up to 70-80 to maximize fitness and to consolidate aerobic gains. Note: Unless you have hit a mileage before, do not increase more than 10% or 3 miles (4.8 km) in a given week. For example, For someone running 60 mpw, mileage by week coming off of a break would be 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 35, 45, 50, 53, 55, 50, 55, 58, 60. Note that as the mileage increases to near maximum, the increase in mileage per week slows and lower mileage weeks are built in for recovery. Most 800 runners have a need to taper mileage every third week by ~20-30% (i.e. w1=60, w2=60, w3=45, w4=60...) in order to prevent physical and mental burnout. Build this into your schedule!  , After the mileage is built up, start including strides at the 800 meter date pace. For example, 12 x 100 @ 800 with 300 jog. This is to reinforce speed principles and build muscle memory/efficiency without straining and/or compromising aerobic conditioning. Also include 5K workouts (i.e. x mins @ 5K pace, x minutes recovery, where x starts at 2 and works up to 3-5 minutes for a maximum of 20-25 minutes). A great way to ensure that you are not overworking your athletes, but to keep hammering the different physiological systems is to do three week mini-cycles (i.e. in a 3 week span, you do 1 tempo runs, 1 day of cruise intervals, 2 days of 5K intervals, 1 day of 3K intervals, and 1 day of 200 meter hills, so 33% of the workouts are lactate threshold, 33% are VO2, and 33% are efficiency (At vVO2 or 1500/800 effort).   This can also be done at threshold pace for those focusing on XC (workout would be x mins @ slightly slower than 10K pace with 1 min recovery, starting at 2 minutes and working up to 6-10 minutes). Threshold pace is the pace at which a steady state of lactic acid is accumulated in the blood (~ 4 mM). Additional effort will cause a significant increase in lactic acid accumulation and will not improve your body's ability to buffer lactic acid and to clear it. Thus, it is an effort and not a pace. Sample week: Sunday: 15 miles (24 km), Monday: 6 miles (9.7 km) + 6 x Hills, Tuesday: 4 x 6 min @ T with one min jog, LIFT. Wednesday: OFF Thursday: 10 miles (16 km) + Hill Sprints. Friday: 6 miles (9.7 km) + 12 x 100 @ 800, LIFT, Saturday: 8 miles (13 km) easy.  Start including intervals @ 5K pace. Intervals can start @ 400's and work up to intervals that take between 3-5 minutes (for example, 6 x 1K @ 5K with equal time recovery). Distance running increases mitochondria, increases the number of capillaries, and increases stroke volume, decreasing heart rate (aka, the infrastructure). VO2 max training on the other hand increases the ability of the body to take oxygen, absorb it into the blood stream, and subsequently deliver it to muscles (think the cars using the infrastructure) while threshold training helps to eliminate byproducts of training (think maintenance crews). Thus, they are all important and all have their place. VO2 max workouts should replace the Friday workout, which can replace hill sprints one of the days or can move to Saturday. At this point, the runner should be in great aerobic fitness and strong, but not "fast". Downhill sprints or sprints that are wind assisted should be incorporated to reinforce turnover.  Now it is time to concentrate on race specificity. Workouts should now be 3 days a week and can often work on a 14 day cycle (i.e. every 14 days includes 1 VO2 max workout (aka 5K pace), 1 threshold workout, 1 workout at vVO2 (aka 3K pace), 1 workout @ 1500 pace, and 2 workouts @ 800/400 pace). For example, work from 8 x 300 @ 1500 date pace to 5 x 600 @ 1500 date pace. Interval length should for the most part be no longer than half of the race and the total distance at this pace should be no more distance than 2.5 times race distance (at that point, if you can run that, it's not your race pace, or you are recovering too long!). You can also run race simulations (600 @ 800 or 400 @ 800, 1 min, 200 @ 800).   Make SURE to keep up the work focusing on turnover, otherwise the 400 will suffer. Running the 4x4 at every indoor meet is a good way to turn a race into a full speed workout. Take days easy/off as necessary for races, but train through (i.e. don't take 3 days off to recover for a dual meet). Lifting should cut back to one day per week to account for the increased intensity of workouts, but can be replaced by plyometrics (depth jumps, alternate leg step-up jumps on an appropriate bench, alternate leg bounds, straight legged jumps (calve workout), etc.).  Now is the time to blast the anaerobic system. My favorite workout is 8-12 x 200 @ 800 meter date pace (pace you could run that day) with a 200 meter jog. This workout will give your body superior ability to buffer lactic acid, be relatively stress free mentally, and is just a good third workout. Running 4 x 400 at 800 meter date pace is a fantastic way to teach your body to run fast through fatigue. Practice running these date-pace type workouts with intervals both at "first lap pace" (i.e. goal pace - 2 seconds) and "second lap pace" (I.e goal pace + 2 seconds).   Lifting should be minimized and focus should be on form building plyometrics. Focus should be on longer intervals (i.e. 400's at 800 meter date pace) and should work towards goal pace (i.e. 5-6 x 300 at 800 meter goal pace with ample recovery). Increased focus on training at 400 pace should also be included, as the 800 time is in part limited by speed endurance, i.e. how fast one can run the 400 (400 time x 2 + 12 seconds = rough ceiling).  A taper should be a slight cut down on quantity, a slight increase in quality, and a few extra days easy before race. We are natural hunters and gatherers. Therefore, cutting back mileage excessively will cause your body to go into hibernation mode. A workout such as 200, 300, 300, 200 for goal pace race simulation is a great easy workout, followed by 6 x 150 @ 400 to reinforce speed and turnover. Again, do not cut your mileage by more than 20%, but thresholds and VO2 work should be minimized (i.e., no more than 10 minutes a week of efforts at these paces to reinforce maintenance of physiological adaptations).  Take two weeks off to recuperate for the coming year. Lifting is encouraged, but other than that, have fun!  

start with strength training.  increase total fitness during the base season, aka early summer.  increase the intensity during the late summer period to include high-end aerobic work and start race specific work.  increase training in the fall.  continue in the winter.  pick up the pace in spring.  taper.  relax post-season. 

 Mindfulness is the practice of bringing your attention to the present moment, helping you notice your physical and emotional sensations. This is particularly helpful in order to recognize your own and others’ feelings.To be effective, you’ll want to start your practice when you are not overwhelmed by strong emotions. Begin by setting aside just 5 minutes to sit and breathe. Focus completely on your breath. When your attention wanders, don’t pass judgment. Simply re-focus on your breath. You can enhance your emotional well-being by incorporating mindfulness into your daily life. For example, stopping at a red light, hearing a telephone ring, or even purposely setting an hourly bell or alarm, can help you remember to pause and engage in mindfulness for a few minutes., Mindfulness helps you slow down to become more in tuned with your emotional experience. A body scan meditation helps you dig deeper, to recognize the way you experience these feelings in your physical body.To do a body scan, you’ll start from either the top of your head or the bottom of your feet. Work your way up through each body part, assessing what each part feels like. Is it relaxed, tense, numb, etc.? If you notice tension or discomfort, imagine breathing in relaxation and letting the discomfort melt away. Engage in deep breathing throughout the exercise.  You need time to decompress from your own emotional experience and release any emotional contagion that you absorb from the world around you. A great way to perform self-care is by carving out time each day to do something you enjoy.During this time, you might listen to music, read a book, go for a run, take a bath, or cook yourself a nourishing meal.  You may think of yoga as a form of physical exercise, but this ages-old practice can also help with emotional self-regulation. Yoga promotes mind-body awareness and can help you relieve conditions such as anxiety and depression.Sign up for a yoga class in your area. Or, view yoga videos on YouTube to start your practice.  If you are constantly plugged into the news, social media, and television shows, it can be hard to tell which emotions are yours and which have been absorbed from various media sources. Regular unplugging can offer a release from this ambush of emotional energy.Dedicate 30 minutes or an hour each day to unplugging. Go outdoors, take a nap, or simply sit and enjoy the silence.  If you are having problems balancing your own feelings with those of others, journaling may help. See it as an outlet for you to pour out any thoughts and emotions that are inside of you. As you develop your practice, you may start to see trends in your entries that explain why you are feeling or behaving a certain way. 

practice mindfulness.  learn to identify and label your emotions with a body scan.  schedule daily me-time.  begin a yoga practice.  unplug often to prevent emotional overload.  journal. 

 The jar can be as small or as large as you'd like, from a baby food jar, to a Mason jar and beyond. Just be sure you have sufficient glitter and food coloring for the jar size you're going to use.   Clean the jar before use, to remove any food residue from it.; , The food coloring should enhance or match the glitter coloring. There should be plenty of glitter; it is suggested that you use about 1.5 tablespoons of craft glitter and 1.8 fl oz of glue glitter per Mason jar amount of water.   The craft glitter can be shaped if you prefer, such as little stars or animal shapes. Check your craft store to see what's on offer.  Pour the boiling water into the jar.  Go slowly, adding only enough to reach the color you desire.  Tip in the craft glitter and the glitter glue. Stir to mix through.  Check that it won't fall off.  Whenever you want some sparkle in your life, or you need to calm yourself in some way, give the jar a good shake and watch the glitter swirl around for a time, creating a beautiful scene.  

choose a suitable jar.  assemble glitter and food coloring.  boil enough water to almost fill the jar.  add a few drops of food coloring.  add the glitter.  place the lid on securely.  use. 

 The quickest way to create a zip file is to place all of the files that you want to archive into one folder. You can place multiple files and folders into the folder that you are creating the ZIP file from.   Rename the folder to whatever you want the ZIP file to be named.; , Hover your cursor over the “Send to” option. This will open a new submenu. Select “Compressed (zipped) folder”.   You can also select multiple files in your file explorer, right-click on one of them, and then follow the above steps. The resulting ZIP file will contain all of the selected files and will be named after the file that you right-clicked on.  If you are adding a lot of files to the new ZIP file, it may take a few moments to create it. A progress bar will appear as files are added. Once the process is complete, the ZIP file will appear in the same location as the original folder. 

create a folder.  right-click on the folder.  wait for the folder to be created. 

 Adolescence is a very peculiar and awkward stage in a child’s life. This a stage children start forming perspectives in all matters. And it is based on limited knowledge with huge areas of ignorance and misconception. Determination to rebel against established practices is also often evident in adolescents. Handling them at this stage can be a tight rope walk for parents and this is a stage where many parents falter. Friction at this stage can create emotional scars which remains permanently etched in the memory of the child. Perceptions from these conflicts can influence behavior towards the parents during the later part of their lives, so it is important give a patient listening to the child’s views. Try to understand their viewpoint and gently guide them to a clearer understanding by pointing out fallacies or fallacious assumptions on the child's part.; , The fault may be with one of the parent or both. There may be an ego problem. The best solution in such situations is for the parents to consult a psychiatrist and frankly explain him the position. The psychiatrist will decide whether it is the parents or the child or both who need counseling and take appropriate action to set right the situation.  Listen to them and give them a feeling that you are giving a good listening to their views. Put special efforts to read and be up on the topics of interest to them like: movie gossip, latest fashion, trends, celebrities, electronic games. Discuss these with them as a friend. This will help remove inhibitions and make the children more comfortable coming out with their problems. This will also give them confidence that you are in tune with the current trend, so what you say will have more relevance.  Participate in the discussion with their friends. Give a friendly poke wherever you feel you need to correct the direction. They will not mind it.  Nurture the entrepreneur quality in the child, giving room for exploratory do-it-yourself behaviors that encourage individual cognitive styles and creative innovations. This an approach that may, in time, lead to more incisive thinkers who can be creative in their thinking throughout their career.  Children in this age group usually develop attachment to careers and professions without full knowledge of the details for a particular career path or considering potential pit falls fully. It is the parent's responsibility to encourage the child to explore each career in detail. Together, you might list the pros and cons for a profession. Make it a game. You might try to come up with more pros than they list, for example. If, after examining all aspects of a profession and with full and complete understanding, the child insists on pursuing their chosen profession, then you should be supportive of that choice and work with them to ensure success.  It is very important to correctly assess the monetary needs of your child and fulfill them. Your perspective of needs may be too conservative; their perspective may be too liberal in relation to actual needs. A middle of the road approach is needed, a compromise acceptable to both. Shortage of money may lead the child to make bad decisions on how to acquire money or possessions. An excess reinforces unwelcome spending habits. A child should habitually make a realistic budget and periodically review spending with an eye to conforming to their budget.  There is nothing wrong about that. Always be supportive of your children, even if their choice of friends may upset you. Experimentation at this age is normal, perfectly normal. The parents need not get alarmed so long as the relationship stays within decent limits. With the passage of time the infatuation subsides and the child is back to normal. Always be attentive, especially when you suspect an unhealthy relationship. Be supportive of your child and make sure that they can always feel comfortable asking for advice.  Smoking and drinking are consider vices by some families and habits by others. It is better to talk about these behaviors with your children. Tell them about your own experiences. Let them know that they don't need to start unhealthy behaviors just because their friends do. Offer to buy the cigarettes, but talk about the long-term health effects and let them know that their decision to smoke is an unwise lifestyle choice. Teach them how to drink properly. They should eat something first, but nothing sweet and they should not mix different types of drinks. Let them test their boundaries at home in safe surroundings so they know how much they can drink without getting out of control or becoming a danger to themselves or others.  Certain parents exercise too much control over their children in the name of discipline. The children grow up in an atmosphere of fright and subservience. Such children often grow up with low self esteem and seldom become good leaders or decision makers. It is important for children to have respect for the parents but they should not be afraid of the parents.  

understand that the child has grown up and respect the right to have an opinion different than yours.  consult a psychiatrist: in case you feel that you are not able to get along with the adolescent, or there is no cohesion between the thinking of the two, the usual tendency to blame the child is not correct.  be extremely friendly with them for understanding them better: this a formative stage when children form opinions about their future.  be a facebook contact of your child: this will help you keep in touch with your child’s daily activities.  encourage the entrepreneur quality of your child.  provide career guidance.  meet your child's monetary needs.  communicate about their infatuations and relationships: this is an age the children are infatuated with members of the opposite sex or the same sex.  address habits and vices.  facilitate building of their esteem and self-confidence. 

 It doesn't really matter. Any will do. Pack a backpack with papers and a lunchbox, and maybe a book or small pencil case. Your teddy is now ready to go to school.; , Write a day plan and include subjects like math, reading, and writing. Fold a towel in half and lay it in front of the board. That's the mat.

To help you try to sleep again, focus your mind on a non-Christmas related, somewhat unusual topic, or just simply relax your body. If you are genuinely too excited to sleep, read on.      ; , Attempt to read a slightly difficult book to read. If you read a difficult or boring book, there may be a chance of going back to bed. Also, reading in bed instead of a couch will help out, because you will be in a more comfortable position to fall asleep. If you cannot fall asleep with this method, just grab an interesting book that you can get stuck into and read for a while.  You can just sit in bed doing head rolls and even yoga positions for fun. They will relax the body and make you less anxious and tense.  Thinking about the story line will definitely pass the time. Try not to associate anything about Christmas into the story, making you, once again, more anxious. You can also draw.   On the other hand, maybe it's a good idea to set your mind on writing a short story (or even a novel) with a Christmas theme to it. Be sure to write out the blurb, who its written by, and include the illustrations and front cover.  If you have a laptop in your room, surf the web for a bit. You might get pre-occupied with what you're doing and may lose track of time. Just avoid looking at your computer's clock (if it's on your taskbar).

Try to avoid stations with Christmas movie marathons, because this will obviously make you think of Christmas. If you are allowed to use on-demand, rent a movie or two. Preferably something you wanted to see when it came out in theaters, or an action movie.  Put on your headphones, turn on a game console and play on it for a lengthy amount of time.

Try using foods like mince pies, carrots, cookies and milk to get yourself into the wonderful Christmas spirit!  , Also, perhaps scan the room to check if he has left you a letter!  , If you have your parent's permission, open your stocking.

 If you suspect that your cat has gone blind or is losing her sight, schedule an appointment with your cat’s veterinarian right away. Some types of blindness are reversible if they are treated right away. For example, if your cat is suffering from blindness caused by hypertension, a daily medication may restore her sight and prevent further health problems as well.Make sure that your cat gets regular check-ups with a veterinarian even if she seems healthy. Early diagnosis and treatment of a problem can prevent your cat from going blind.; , Sometimes a cat will go blind over a period of days, weeks, or months. After the cat has become mostly or totally blind, you may begin to notice some strange behavior. Observe your cat to determine if she might be blind. Some of the behaviors that blind cats display include:Seeming confused about her surroundings Bumping into furniture and other objects Missing jumps or landings that she used to manage with ease Seeming reluctant to move around or venture outdoors Rubbing or squinting her eyes  , If your cat’s behavior has you suspicious that she might have gone blind, inspect her eyes to see if they look different than usual.

Help your cat to feel calm and safe by avoiding making loud noises and asking others to do the same.If you accidentally make a loud noise, make sure to comfort your cat by petting her and speaking softly to her. Some other suggestions for maintaining a calm environment include:   Getting up slowly from a chair instead of jumping up suddenly Walking upstairs to speak to someone instead of yelling up to them Avoiding slamming cupboards and doors  , Since your cat can no longer see you when she enters a room, you might want to develop a habit of humming or chatting to yourself to let her know where you are. Your cat may also feel safer and more relaxed if you hum and chat when you are around her. This will also help prevent startling your cat when you want to pet her. By announcing your presence, she will be less likely to be surprised by the feeling of your hand on her back., If your cat used to go outside before she went blind, stay with your cat as much as you can when she ventures outside. By being present as your cat rediscovers the outdoors, you can rescue her from any mishaps while still allowing her to enjoy being outside.   Try keeping your cat in an enclosed garden when she wants to go outside. This will help minimize the chances that she will get injured or lost.Consider getting a cat harness and leash to prevent your cat from wandering off into danger. If you are unable to monitor your cat while she is outside, do not let her go out.  If your cat has been diagnosed with a medical condition that requires special treatment, medication, or other interventions, make sure that you follow the veterinarian’s instructions. If your cat’s blindness is related to a medical condition, it will not improve until she is cured. Contact your veterinarian immediately if your cat’s condition worsens or does not improve despite treatment.   Be aware that some forms of blindness are not reversible even with medical interventions. Your cat may remain blind for the rest of her life, but she can still have a happy life., Your cat is still normal. Even though she has gone blind, she will still want to do everything that a cat likes to do, like playing. While buying toys, look for cat toys that are made specifically for blind cats. Also, shift from sight-based games to sound-based ones, such as "follow-the-noise." Anything that crinkles, crackles, resounds or can be tapped can serve as a new source of entertainment.   Try buying toys that squeak like a mouse or chirp like a bird. Your cat might like to play follow the noise with those types of toys.  Groom your cat regularly, feed your cat nutritious food, provide occasional treats, and take your cat to a vet for regular check-ups. Pay special attention to your cat's nose and ears, as these senses now make life easier for your cat.   Keep your cat’s food and water in the same place they have always been kept. Consider adding a second litter box to make it easier for your cat to get to the bathroom in time. It may take her longer to find the box now that she is blind.

 Cortisone creams help reduce inflammation of the skin and promote healing.Talk to your doctor to determine which kind of cortisone cream is right for you.   Cortisone creams are available in both prescription and over-the-counter forms. Only apply the cream to the affected skin, and be sure to read the labels for instructions on use.  Lightening creams that contain ingredients such as kojic acid, arbutin, licorice extract, mulberry extract, and vitamin C can help safely lighten and fade skin hyperpigmentation caused by acne scars without causing damage or irritation.Avoid products that contain hydroquinone, as this popular skin-lightening chemical can irritate your skin and has been labelled a potential carcinogen.If you have darker skin (esp. for black/African people), avoid lightening creams. They may permanently remove melanin from your skin, which can create a worse blemish.  Glycolic and salicylic acids are found in many skincare products, such as creams, scrubs and ointments, as they are effective exfoliants which help skin to shed layers, bringing hyperpigmented skin to the surface, before helping it to disappear completely.You could also book an appointment with a dermatologist to get a glycolic chemical peel, which work in the same way, but will penetrate deeper layers of skin.  Retinoids are vitamin A derivatives which are used in a wide array of skin care products treating fine lines and wrinkles, skin discoloration, and acne. Retinoids boost collagen production and speed up cell turnover, making them a great choice for targeting acne scars. These creams can be a little on the pricey side, but they are highly recommended by dermatologists for their fast, effective results.   You can purchase some retinoid creams over-the-counter, such as those produced by major skincare brands. However, stronger creams are available by prescription from your dermatologist. The ingredients in retinoid creams are sensitive to the UVA rays in sunlight, so these creams should only be applied at night in order to protect your skin., These treatments are not going to fade your acne scars overnight, as they can be quite harsh and the skin will take time to heal. However, they are definitely worth considering if your find that creams and lotions aren't working, or you're more concerned about evening out your skin tone.   A chemical peel involves having a concentrated acidic solution applied to the skin. It will burn away the top layers of skin, leaving fresh, new layers of skin underneath. Microdermabrasion produces similar results, but it works by exfoliating the skin using a rotating wire brush.  

start with a cortisone cream.  try an over-the-counter skin lightening cream.  use glycolic or salicylic acid treatments.  use retinoid skin products.  think about microdermabrasion and chemical peels. 

 Sprinkle the gelatin over cold water in a small bowl and let it rest for two minutes to soften. Place the bowl in a microwave for 30 seconds on high, until the gelatin dissolves.

 After you’ve drafted your essay, walk away from it for a while. This could be for a few hours or a few days. Once you come back to it, it can be easier to see where it needs editing, what you can keep, and what just doesn’t work.For example, write your admissions essay on a Saturday morning and then don't look at it again until Sunday or Monday night. After writing it, you'll have a better idea of what you actually wanted to say. It will be obvious after some time away where you're saying what you mean and what areas need work.  Once you've drafted your essay, you should reread and edit it more than once. Read your essay first to make sure that it says exactly what you want it to say. Then read it again for spelling and grammar errors.You can also ask someone else to proofread your essay for you. Asking a teacher, parent, or older sibling is probably the best way to go, since they might be more familiar with what's expected from college admissions essays., Make sure that your essay does not exceed the maximum word and page length. This might mean cutting out whole sentences or it might mean using less words to say the same thing. If you have trouble with this, ask a friend to check your writing for unnecessary words.For example, instead of saying "I want to tell you about the process I went through to decide to become a doctor," you could say, "I want to share how I decided to become a doctor."  , Don’t use the same words over and over in your essay. Most word processing software has a “thesaurus” function. If you find you’re repeating the same words, use it.Make sure you're replacing your original vocabulary with words that mean the same thing. Different words have different connotations, and not every suggestion from the thesaurus will have the exact meaning you’re looking for.  

give yourself some space.  proofread your essay.  write succinctly.  vary your vocabulary. 

 Spot reduction, which means reducing fat in one specific area, is a weight loss myth. Toning certain areas, like the arms and stomach, can make them look trimmer and thinner, but to remove fat you have to focus on your entire body.   Losing weight and keeping it off involves a calorie controlled diet and 60 minutes of moderate exercise, such as brisk walking, a day. Fat from your belly is usually the first to go during a weight loss regimen, and regular high-intensity aerobic workouts tend to lead to slimmer waists.Circuit training workouts are another good exercise that combat belly fat by reducing fat throughout the body. Circuit workouts can be found online or you can enroll in a class at your gym. Workouts are divided into circuits that combine cardio exercises. Circuits are performed continually, with no breaks in between. A good circuit routine increases heart rate and strengthens a variety of muscles, shifting focus to the entire body and not just the stomach.; , To tone your stomach, you should focus on your core muscles by doing exercises that target the abdomen. This won't help you lose fat, but it can make an already skinny stomach appear more toned and, therefore, flat. It can also increase the effectiveness of current workouts, resulting in you burning more calories during your normal routine.   The crunch is a classic core strengthening exercise. Lie on your back and place your feet against a wall so they're bent at a 90-degree angle. Cross your arms on your chest, lift your head and shoulders forward and take in three breaths before lying back down. Repeat.Planks are another popular core exercise. Get in the push-up position with your hands under your shoulders. Keep your legs straight out in behind you and your feet together. Instead of lowering down for a push-up, hold the pose as long as you can. Challenge yourself each time to hold the pose longer.Workout routines like Pilates and yoga focus primarily on core muscles. You can enroll in a class or find routines online. Many YouTube vloggers and exercise enthusiasts post easy-to-follow Pilates and yoga routines that can be done from home with no more than a mat and basic workout clothing.  While spot reduction is impossible, some exercises focus on areas towards the abdomen. Side bends can increase blood flow to the abdomen which can increase oxygen levels and may help you gain muscle, toning your stomach. It also might help you strengthen your body overall, resulting in more efficient workouts and less soreness.Bend to one side while holding your opposite arm over your head and then bend to the other side, raising your other arm. Do this until you've done 10 stretches on either side of your body. Many people use weights during side bends, but this is bad for your muscles and can also result in a thicker waist due to excess muscle.When trying to narrow the waist, focus on exercises that cause your waist to twist and rotate, so that you are not adding bulk to your waist.  Salt can have a negative effect on any weight loss routine, which can sabotage your ability to lose troublesome belly fat. Especially short term, this is a quick way to limit bloat and get a flatter stomach.   Bloating in the stomach often results from carrying excess water. Water retention in the body is related to a heavy intake of sodium.Decrease your sodium intake. Read food labels to see how much sodium is in the products you consume. Be careful, however, as labels can be deceitful. Sometimes, a bag of chips doesn't look too unhealthy until you realize the nutritional information is "per serving" and the bag comes with 2.5 servings. Be realistic about how much of a product you expect to eat and calculate how much sodium you'll consume.Avoid processed foods and do not add too much salt to table foods. Watch out for canned vegetables and soy sauces, which can be salt-heavy., Processed or refined grains, like those found in white rices and breads, contain empty calories that can manipulate hormone levels in the body and result in excess fat production. Swapping refined grains for whole grains when possible can result in a flatter stomach.   Whole grains are a group of foods that contain all the naturally-occurring nutrients of a food's entire grain seed in its original proportion. Processed grains are grains that have been cracked, rolled, crushed, cooked, or otherwise tampered with, resulting in less overall nutritional value. Whole wheats, like whole wheat bread and brown rice, are a type of whole grain. Other whole grains include barley, buckwheat, oats, and quinoa.Eating refined grains triggers a body process in which blood sugar levels rise and insulin spikes. When this occurs, the body is more ready to deposit fat and tends to do so in the abdomen.Whole grain, high fiber foods help regulate insulin levels in the body. This lowers overall blood glucose levels, which results in a reduction of fat deposition.Purchase whole wheat breads, brown rices, oatmeal, and whole wheat tortillas over refined varieties. Always read the food labels however. Oftentimes products labeled as "whole wheat" are secretly made with mostly refined wheat and only a small amount of whole wheat flour. Whole wheat flour should be the first item on a product's ingredient list if it's truly whole wheat. Breads made at a grocery store's bakery and not shipped from elsewhere are more likely to be truly whole wheat., Whole wheat is just the beginning. For a flat, trimmed stomach, the bulk of your calories should come from healthy foods.   Ditch sugary and processed foods. Potato chips, TV dinners, and fast foods should be purged from your diet.Beans and other legumes are high-quality carbohydrates packed with protein.

Be careful, however. While healthy, nuts are high-calorie and it's easy to accidentally go overboard and end up gaining weight by overeating., Alcohol is a bad idea for anyone wanting to lose belly fat for a variety of reasons.   Heavy drinkers tend to have what's known as a "beer gut" or a "beer belly." This is because alcohol releases estrogen into the bloodstream, which makes you more likely to hold onto fat and more likely to gain weight.Alcohol also increases appetite while simultaneously lowering inhibitions and self-control. Binge drinking episodes often end in late night snacking or eating junk food. The calories from alcohol combine with the calories from excess eating while drinking, resulting in massive caloric intake in a single night.  Drinking water throughout the day has an impact on weight loss. Staying hydrated can result in a slimmer waistline   Numerous studies have found a correlation between water and weight loss. While scientists are not sure why water has an effect on lowering body weight, it's suspected water helps fill up the stomach.

If you have less access to the foods you consume when stressed, the temptation is easier to avoid.Find a distraction if you're tempted to eat when stressed. Puzzles, games, and reading can be an alternative to eating. You can even use light exercise, like a short walk, as a means to cope rather than going for food.Look into practicing relaxation skills like yoga, deep breathing, stretching, and meditation.

 Your first instinct is likely to reach for a glass cleaner. It makes some sense. However, window cleaner is fairly strong, stronger than what you want for cleaning an LED screen. It can strip the sensitive surface, so it's best to avoid it., When browsing electronic cleaners, avoid any that don't specifically say they are alcohol- and ammonia-free. While some sites recommend using equal parts of isopropyl alcohol and water on LED screens, the truth is any alcohol or ammonia may strip the coating off your screen., If you use a cleaner that your manual specifically says not to use, that will likely void your warranty. Reading your manual ahead of time can save you a lot of grief in the future if you ever need to take your electronic device in for repairs.

 Before your surgery, you will probably be required to meet with a nutritionist. This nutritionist will help you with a few important things. The nutritionist will teach you how to modify your diet so your surgery can be successful due to your lifestyle changes.Your nutritionist will also help you make diet changes before the surgery that leads to pre-op weight loss. Your nutritionist will let you know any restrictions or instructions you should follow just before the surgery.  In the months leading to your surgery, you will work with a nutritionist to change the way you eat and the way you view food. One main concern is the size of your stomach post-op. Your stomach will be much smaller, so you will be unable to eat as much food as before.Since your stomach is smaller after the surgery, you will eat less. This means you will have to fill your stomach with nutritious food instead of junk food. Only eating junk food after your surgery can lead to malnutrition, prevent weight loss, and other uncomfortable side effects or conditions. Before your surgery, retrain your palate to eat healthy, nutritious foods that will nourish your body, keep you full, and keep you healthy.  Pre-op diet plans help you begin developing eating habits you will continue after the surgery. One important thing to start doing is to eat three portion-controlled meals each day, including breakfast.You can have one to two small snacks each day. Try to eliminate any eating four hours before bedtime.  Patients who prepare for bariatric surgery are encouraged to eat more protein. A diet high in protein helps aid and boost weight loss.Your doctor or nutritionist will advise you on how many calories you should eat a day, along with the proper amount of protein to include each day.   Make sure you are choosing healthy sources of protein. A diet full of fatty meats, bacon, and steak is not going to help you. Eat lean red meat, such as 85/15 or 93/7 ground beef. Choose skinless chicken breast and fish. Eggs contain a lot of protein. Nuts are a great source of protein, as are beans. Low-fat dairy contains protein. Try Greek yogurt and low-fat cheese. In conjunction with this high protein diet, you should eat significantly less carbs, saturated fat, and refined sugars.Most pre-op diets suggest 800 to 1200 calories per day with 70 to 120 grams of protein each day., Your psychologist, nutritionist, or dietician may require you to track your daily eating habits. Doing this can help in multiple ways. Tracking your food may help you discover problem foods or problems times of the day.Tracking your food also helps you learn how to eat with your new lifestyle changes. If you are on a calorie-controlled diet, you can keep count of the calories you eat a day. If you need a certain amount of protein, you can also tally your daily grams. Also track your water. You will be encouraged to drink more water and limit other beverages, especially sugary beverages.  Part of the process that goes along with bariatric surgery is learning how to eat. This includes eating with purpose. Start eating slowly, making sure to chew each bite and taste the food.You can start paying attention to the way your body feels when you eat. This includes learning to know when you are full, or being able to recognize foods that do not agree with you. You will start learning how to stop mindlessly eating or emotional eating. For example, you should stop eating in front of the TV or while working. You should also not turn to food when you are tired or stressed.  

meet with a nutritionist.  learn to eat for health.  change your daily eating habits.  eat protein.  track your food.  eat mindfully. 

 Light a coal or gas grill to medium high heat.  Remove the shrimp from the refrigerator and rinse them in cool water. Shake the excess water from the shrimp.  Pierce the skewers through both the tail and the thickest part of the shrimp toward the head.   Metal or wooden skewers are both fine to use. If you use wooden skewers, soak them in water for 10 minutes before threading the shrimp onto them. This will prevent the skewers from burning. Consider threading the skewers with onion slices, green and red pepper slices, and other vegetables with the shrimp.  Lightly cover the shrimp with olive oil on both sides. Season it with salt and pepper to taste.  Cook them on one side for 3 - 4 minutes. Turn them and cook on the other side for another 3-4 minutes. The shrimp are done when they're bright pink and the flesh is opaque.  Take the shrimp off the skewers and serve hot.

 When speaking in class, it can help to have an idea of what to say going into a discussion. You may feel less nervous participating in a discussion if you have a thorough knowledge of your subject matter.Do your homework. If you know there's a debate or discussion coming up in class, preparing ahead of time can help. You'll be more at ease participating in class if you know what you're talking about, so do the reading and homework before coming to class. Plan what to say before raising your hand. Think of a short sentence, or at least a couple of key points, before you volunteer to speak. It may help to jot down some of your ideas on a piece of paper before raising your hand to give an answer.; , It can help to relax before speaking. This can make you feel more at ease, allowing yourself to speak with more confidence. Relaxing can also loosen your vocal cords, allowing you to talk in a loud, cohesive manner.Take a few deep breaths before speaking. Try to breathe in a way that draws breath down into your stomach. Inhale and exhale deeply before raising your hand, as this will allow you to speak louder. Make an effort to relax your body before speaking. Relax your shoulders and neck, as tense muscles in these places will make it difficult to project your voice.  Stand up with a straight back. Hold your head so your ears are in line with your shoulders. Keep your chin relaxed and avoid the temptation to jut it forward when you speak. Much like relaxing your body, maintaining proper posture boosts confidence. It also promotes air flow, allowing you to speak clearly., If you're not used to being vocal in class, you may be tempted to yell to make sure you are heard. Yelling strains the voice and makes you sound aggressive. It can cause tension in your neck and throat. Do not yell out the answer. Speak loudly, without raising your voice to the point you can feel stress in your body., Make a conscious effort to speak slow during class discussions. Talking too fast makes you come off as a nervous. Try to speak slowly, pronouncing your words one at a time. This will allow you to get your words out in an understandable manner.It may feel awkward at first. Many people, when nervous, speak fast. If you're giving a longer answer, pause between paragraphs. This will help listeners absorb your words., If you want to be the loud kid, avoid using an affected or false voice when speaking in class. Speaking in a voice that is not your own can strain the vocal cords. If you're working to be the loud kid in class each day, you do not want to put stress on your voice. This will get tiring fast. Speak in your own voice clearly and distinctly., Oftentimes, people are hesitant to be wrong as they fear their own faults. Keep in mind everyone gives a wrong answer on occasion. If you want to be loud in class, and abandon any fears of public speaking, you have to risk being wrong. Remind yourself all your classmates have given wrong answers on occasion, and that the teacher will appreciate you trying even if you're not right every time., Another step to becoming the loud kid in class is working on being more outgoing. In addition to speaking in class, you'll want to branch out and talk to other classmates during downtime. If you're shy by nature, or otherwise nervous, becoming outgoing can be a challenge. Go slowly. It can take awhile to get used to putting yourself out there and socializing.Take small steps forward. Smile at a classmate in the hallway. Say "Hi" to a classmate at lunch. As you progress, try not to back down. You may be tempted, for example, to turn away at the last minute when approaching a new table during lunch. Resist this urge. Succumbing to shyness will only reinforce it, so try to follow through.  As with any behavior, being outgoing takes practice. If you practice engaging in social behaviors, like small talk during class, they'll get easier.Try practicing with your existing friends. You guys can role play scenarios in which you make small talk with kids from your school. You can also work on talking before the mirror. It may feel silly, but you may gain confidence by having mock conversations with yourself. Practice in real life. Outside of school, chat with the cashier at a local coffee shop. If your parents have friends over, say "Hi" and ask them how their day is. The more you practice social behaviors outside of school, the more comfortable you'll feel being loud in the classroom.  If you want to be more outgoing in class, it may help to join some extracurriculars. Pick activities that interest you and attend meetings. You may feel like you can be yourself when socializing with those with shared interests. If you meet people in after school clubs, you'll have a social network in your classroom. This can allow you to feel comfortable talking to others, allowing you to be loud in class.It may take some practice before you feel comfortable talking during extracurricular activities. However, it's important to give yourself a chance. Think of conversation starters before a meeting. For example, write down questions like, "What's your favorite subject in school?" Once you've formed a group from extracurriculars, you'll have someone to talk to during class. You can talk, joke, and be loud together during downtime at school.  Self criticism often prevents people from putting themselves out there and becoming outgoing. Try to remind yourself it's okay to feel nervous or awkward at times. Everyone is insecure, and it's inevitable you'll sometimes feel nervous when trying to become louder and more assertive in school.A good way to curb self criticism is to imagine a friend or loved one criticizing themselves the way you criticize yourself. Try to imagine how you would talk a friend out of nervousness or shyness. Then take your own advice. If you're less insecure, and more accepting of the fact you'll sometimes feel awkward or out of place, you're far more likely to relax and socialize more. This can result in you feeling more comfortable being a loud student in class.  While you may want to be seen as the loud one, you don't want to talk out of turn. Talking without raising your hand can get you in trouble with your teacher. Also, other students may get irritated if you're constantly interrupting. Wait until other students finish their sentences. Only talk when your teacher calls on you, and always raise your hand first.  It's not always a good idea to talk during class. Avoid talking during moments where you may get in trouble for being loud. Do not talk during class lectures or during student presentations. Avoid the temptation to whisper to your friends. While it can be fun to be the loud one in class, you do not want the role to land you in detention.  If you're a louder person by nature, people may not always want to listen. Make sure to stay in tune to social cues so you can catch when you're talking too much.Watch body language. People may break eye contact. They may fiddle with something or seem otherwise distracted. Also, pay attention to what the listener is saying. If they're responding with only "Okays" and "uh-huhs," you're probably talking to much. You should allow the other person to speak.  You want to make sure you listen as much as you talk. Being loud can get annoying if you dominate the conversation. When other people speak, genuinely listen to what they say. Do not simply plan your own response ahead of time. Also, encourage conversation. Ask people open ended questions, like, "What's your opinion on this subject?" and "What do you think about this topic?" If you provoke conversation and discussion, this can help solidify your reputation as a loud student without people thinking of you as dominating or difficult. 

think of what to say ahead of time.  relax.  maintain proper posture.  avoid yelling.  speak slowly.  use your natural voice.  do not worry about being wrong.  start small.  practice social behaviors.  join an extracurricular activity.  accept you'll sometimes feel awkward.  take your turn.  talk only when appropriate.  pay attention to social cues.  listen as much as you talk.

Keep your compliments light yet meaningful, and don’t go overboard.  Personalize the phone call by using the girl’s name periodically throughout your conversation. Don’t say her name at the start of every sentence, but throw it in casually every now and then so she feels special., It can be difficult to convey that you are listening to someone, since you can’t rely on eye contact and body language.

 For a basic henna paste, you'll need a few ingredients. Utensils, such as stirring spoons and mixing bowls, should be found somewhere in your home kitchen.   Henna powder. Gazab henna powder is recommended.Be sure to buy body art quality henna, and not henna for hair. Cloves. Cloves are a type of flower, typically used in spices.Seven or eight cloves are a good match for a standard bag of henna powder. Make sure to use solid cloves rather than their oil. Clove oils are known to be harmful.Grounded coffee beans. Two tablespoons of finely grounded coffee beans are enough to match a standard bag of henna powder. Lemon juice. Lemon juice bottles can typically be picked up at a food or dollar store. The lemon juice will be added to the powder before you add the heated coffee clover mixture.; , A perfect henna paste will be consistent. This means taking out the bigger particles that may put up a fight against stirring.          Store the powder in a sealable glass container. This will limit the risk of the powder coming into contact with moisture.  Stir the ingredients together until they're relatively consistent.          For the time being, the henna powder itself should be kept separate from the rest of your mixture.  Pour the mixture into a pot and bring a stovetop element to medium-high. Wait until the mixture has reached a rolling boil, then take it off the element.  You can do this by sifting it, much as you did with the henna powder. Sift through a cheesecloth into another bowl.          Sifting the mixture multiple times will maximize the chances that you got all of the particulate sediment out of it.  Add one tablespoon of lemon juice per every two tablespoons of ground coffee you're using in the other mixture. Pour it onto the powder, then stir it thoroughly until you think it's consistent.          Using an alternative to lemon juice (like an oil) may drastically change the dye's release time.Do not use lemon juice if you are allergic to citrus. Strong, cold black tea or flat Coke or Pepsi will work in place of the lemon juice. Keep in mind, however, that caffeine is absorbed through skin, so do not use a caffeinated beverage if you are sensitive to it.  Add the coffee clove mixture into your henna powder bowl by using a tablespoon. Gauge your mixture by stirring consistently after delivering each tablespoon into the mix. You can stop adding mixture to the powder when the powder has a toothpaste-like consistency.         Add the mixture one spoonful at a time. This will make sure you have sufficient control over the consistency.  Tea Tree, Lavender, and Frankincense are a few of the oils you might use for this. 30ml of essential oil should be enough to add color to your henna mixture. As always, stir it thoroughly once it's been added.  Applying it before it's been sufficiently released will result in a weak stain. Wrap over the top of the mixing bowl with plastic wrap and tie it over with an elastic band.          Tape over the plastic bag with your fingers as you place it over the bowl. This will force the excess air out of the bowl as you secure it. Alternatively, the hotter the room or area is, the faster it will be for the henna's dye to release in the mixture.  Wash your skin with soap and water. This will rub away any excess dirty and help maximize the effectiveness of your henna.  However, narrow tipped funnels and specialized henna funnels are perfect for henna application. Henna funnels can be purchased from anywhere where regular henna powder is sold.   Henna funnels sometimes come in packs alongside the powder. Henna funnels can be made at home as well by rolling plastic into a cone and snipping off the end with scissors.  Use a spoon to gradually fill the funnel up with paste.Take a tablespoonful of the paste and let it drip slowly into the funnel. Done in this way, you'll be able to control the amount that comes into your funnel without risking damage to the funnel itself. Fill the funnel until it is roughly 2         Because the henna paste has such a sticky consistency, you'll have to be patient while the funnel is filled.  Fold the end of the henna cone and tape it shut with scotch tape.           You can untape the cone and reuse it if you run out of henna paste. However, due to the fact that you'll need to allow the henna time to properly dry into your skin, it's a good idea to make more than the amount of henna you think you'll need.  With this in mind, it's a good idea to keep a wet towel nearby just in case. Wipe away design errors when you first see them.  However, it doesn't take long before the designs begin to fade from the skin. If this is the case, it's a good idea to touch up the designs by lightly tracing over them with fresh henna.  The possibilities with Henna are virtually endless. The complexity of the designs you draw will depend entirely on your skill set. However, if you're just starting out, you'll quickly get a better grasp of what to do.          Once you get the proper hang of henna application, you should make your own original designs. Because the best henna art is often very complex, it may be a good idea to draw out some patterns on paper before applying it to your sin.  

collect materials.  sift the powder out of the bag.using a sifter or cheesecloth, shake the powder into a bowl or container, sifting out the bigger grains in a powder.  mix cloves and coffee together.take two tablespoons of grounded coffee and seven cloves and add them to one cup of water.  boil the mixture.bring your coffee and clover mixture to a boil.  sift the mixture.after you've sufficiently boiled the mixture, it's important to get the larger solids out of the mixture.  add lemon juice to the henna powder.lemon juice will help extract the dyes from the powder itself.  add mixture to your henna powder.  give your mixture essential oils.essential oils are great for the skin, and help make the henna darker without hurting the stickiness or texture.  allow your paste to sit overnight.after it's been mixed, henna needs some time for the dyes to be released.  wash your skin.  get a henna funnel.cooking funnels are generally too wide to successfully apply henna patterns to the skin.  fill your funnel with henna paste.  squeeze and shut the back of the funnel.press your thumbs against the back of the funnel once it is ready.  squeeze it gently for application.take the henna funnel once it's been properly loaded and sealed, and squeeze it gently as you run the nozzle over your skin at a consistent rate.  wipe away smears with water quickly.although henna takes at least 4 hours to dry completely, it does begin to leave a skin stain rather quickly.  touch up your henna over time.henna designs will last from a few days to a couple of weeks.  look up designs.

 Before you bring your dog from the United States to Canada you need to get your vaccination records from your vet. These records will need to detail when your dog had all required vaccinations. If you do not have these records, your dog may not be permitted to enter Canada.   Vaccination records must be issued by a licensed veterinarian. Dogs traveling from the USA to Canada must have been inspected by a veterinarian within the 30 days prior to travel, and the veterinarian must provide a certificate showing that the dog is free from any form of communicable disease. Check with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency before traveling in order to find out if specific vaccinations are required at the time.; , The most important piece of documentation is a letter from your veterinarian certifying that your dog is rabies free and has been vaccinated within the last 3 years (if the vaccine is a 3 year vaccine). This requirement cannot be waived and your dog will not be allowed entry into Canada without a rabies vaccination certification. A rabies certification must:   Clearly name and describe your pet. Specify the type/validity of the rabies vaccine: if it is a 1, 2, or 3 year vaccine. Be in English or French. Dogs under 3 months do not require rabies vaccinations., While you might be overwhelmed with the records and certification you need to get for your dog, make sure not to forget your own documentation. Forgetting your own documentation will stop both you and your dog from entering Canada. Make sure to have:   A current United States government issued passport. If you do not have a passport, you can also provide an enhanced drivers license issued by most U.S. states that border the Canada. Vehicle registration and proof of insurance if you are driving from the U.S. to Canada., Check with your airline regarding their pet policy. If you choose to fly with your dog from the U.S. to Canada you need to first check with your chosen airline to figure out their pet policy. Airlines have very different policies, so take a chance to look around and see what different airlines charge and whether or not you can bring your dog on the airplane with you. Consider:   Most airlines are happy to accommodate your pet, either by keeping them at your seat, or by checking them in to the baggage compartment. Dogs traveling in the cabin of the airplane must meet the airline's size requirements, and they must travel in a carrier that will both accommodate the dog's size and that will fit under the seat in front of you. Most airlines will charge a surcharge for carrying your dog onto the plane. Checking your pet into the baggage department is the only suitable option for dogs that are medium or large in size. They will need to travel in a portable dog kennel or carrier that is large enough for the pet to both lie down and turn around. Your pet will travel on the same flight as you, and the check-in counter will advise you on where to pick up your pet once you've reached your destination. If you plan to check your dog with your luggage, be aware that this could be a very traumatic experience for your pet. There are also incidents in which pets have been injured or killed. , Traveling via rail is another option of going to Canada with your dog. While this is a potentially convenient option, there are a few things to remember. Consider:   Canada's railway operator will only allow service dogs into the passenger cars. Other dogs, however, are allowed to be checked into the baggage car provided they pay an additional fee and that they are properly housed in a pet carrier. Make sure to have your rabies certification handy when you approach the border. , Taking a bus from the U.S. to Canada is another option. Bus regulations concerning dogs vary from bus line to bus line. The obvious advantage of taking a bus is that you won’t have to worry about fueling up your car and have your car inspected at the border. However, make sure to consider:   Always call ahead to find out your bus line’s dog policy before you depart. Larger dogs may not be able to travel safely on a bus, as room may not permit it. You will need the same documentation, including rabies certification, in order for your pet to enter the country., Driving by car with your dog from the USA to Canada is one of the most popular methods of travel. It is possibly the most convenient method for you and your dog because your pup can sit comfortably in the passenger seat or in the back seat. This, of course, avoids any potentially dangerous complications associated with having your dog shipped in a cargo or luggage compartment.   Remember to bring your rabies certification and other vaccination records. Your car may be inspected at the border. Avoid packing any items that could cause delays, such as an excessive amount of dog food or medications., Whatever mode of traveling you’ll be doing, as you approach the border or the line where you’ll talk to border agents or other inspection personnel, you’ll need to prepare your dog for this moment. This is because there are a wide variety of things that can upset your dog when traveling. Your dog might be anxious, he or she might be afraid of people, or he or she might be sleeping. In order to prepare your dog:   Make sure he or she is alert and awake. Don’t provide the opportunity for the inspection agent to wake your dog up – this might scare your dog. Try to calm your dog before interacting with any border personnel or inspection agents. Provide your friend with a treat and reinforce that this will be a positive experience. Try to keep your dog quiet. If your dog is upset or anxious, take a minute and try to relax him or her., Before you approach the inspection agent, you should have your dog’s records, specifically his or her immunization and rabies certification papers, out and ready to turn over to the agent. This will help the inspection process go a lot smoother for all parties involved.  After you’ve got your papers out, you’ll either approach the inspection agent or they will approach you – depending on if you are in a car, in an airport, or traveling by bus or rail. At this point, the inspection agent will ask you to present your papers and will proceed to ask a couple of questions about your dog and your travels. Be prepared to:   Answer questions about your dog’s immunization records. Answer questions about if your dog has been out of the United States anytime during the last 6 months. Have the inspection agent look over and examine your dog for visible signs of illness., All dogs entering Canada will have to be inspected by the Canada Border Services Agency. This inspection will further certify that the dog has been vaccinated for rabies and is rabies free. In addition, inspectors will look at the dog to see if there are signs of other illnesses.   Fees cost $30.00 plus tax for the first dog. An additional $5.00 plus tax will be assessed for additional dogs. If your dog is not properly certified, the cost will be $55.00 plus tax for the first dog, and $30.00 plus tax for any additional dogs. In addition, you will be required to have your dog vaccinated at your own expense within two weeks of arrival. All fees are required at the time and place of inspection.  

gather vaccination records.  get a rabies certification.  secure your own documentation.  travel by air.  bring your dog to canada by railroad.  take a bus.  drive by car.  prepare your dog.  present your papers.  talk to inspection personnel.  be prepared to pay inspection fees. 

 Rather than searching using a search engine, search at a reputable software download site and use the words “convert JPEG GIF.” Consider narrowing your search by specifying only freeware, if you don't want to pay for it.   Look for editor's ratings for reviews written by the website's editorial staff, or user ratings from actual users who have tried it. Both can provide valuable information. If you're not sure which to choose, read through several of the descriptions of products that come up. Don't just read about the product, but go to the website for the company and look for an “About us” page that tells about the company that makes it. See whether it has other products or testimonials from customers. ,, Some programs let you specify multiple files to convert. Others will work in a similar manner to image editing software, in which case you can follow the instructions above.  

search for an image converter software application online.  pick software that has a website which not only lists its capabilities but also offers help files to show you how to use the program.  ,  download and install the software.  ,  run the application. 

 Make sure it doesn't correspond with any fun events you are planning with your family! The best day to have a party is a friday, so before the party starts, if your friends aren't coming, they can drop off their stuffed animals before home time so you can walk home with your stuffed animals and their friends.; , Tell them when the party starts and what time to be there. Write all the details on cute little invitations with a photo of your stuffed animal. If your parents don't allow your friends to come over, tell them to drop their stuffed animal off at your house. Offer to pick your stuffed animal's buddies up and if you use the car, then buckle ALL their friends in. Ask them if their stuffed animal can stay for a sleepover, and let them get their PJs.  Let them choose what they like. Take this opportunity to buy food. Some suggestions are: jelly, pizza, ice cream, fizzy pop, strawberries, crisps, toffee popcorn. Of course, this can be fake if you like. Ask your parents if you can use a camera to take pictures of them having fun and print them out, so they can take them home in their goodie bags.  Remember to hide it and make sure your stuffed animal wants it. You can get their old christmas list and get one of the things that they didn't get.  This means, make a cake and start decorating, and setting the table. You can put a chair with an extra cushion out for your stuffed animal, or simply let him or her sit on your lap. Prepare some fun activities like Legos or drawing and get your stuffed animal's bedroom ready! Lay down the spare mattresses if there is a sleepover and pack the picnic! Prepare everything!  , You could play hide-and-seek (you work in pairs to hide eachother. stuffed animals can be in the same groups, you just need to help them hide together) or make up another cool game. Let your stuffed animal play tag with his friends, or let her play inside. It depends what your stuffed animal wants. If you have video games, let them play, and take lots of pictures of them. Let them go nuts!  , Before letting your stuffed animal open them, ensure they are wrapped properly and you know who they're from so you can thank them later.  Maybe bring a big bag to the park and put the stuffed animals inside. Again take lots of pictures, and let them take turns on what to do. Bring a picnic and put SMALL (you don't want to eat much after that cake!) snacks in. Let your stuffed animals go crazy, once again.  Offer them the sofa and put a blanket over them. Let them watch a movie and wait until the credits roll. Then assure them to their room and tuck them in. Wait until they start to stir and party! (That will happen, if so, let them have a dance party), Have fun!  

write down your stuffed animal's birthday party on a calendar, or just make up a birthday.  invite all of his or her friends, and your friends.  you and your stuffed animal need to go pick out party favors,and decorations.  you can also buy them a present to make their birthday even more special, or you can make one yourself.  get ready for the big day!,  have games to play and crafts to do, when the guests arrive.  serve the dessert, and sing or say 'happy birthday', next do presents.  do crafts and/or games.  wait for everybody to go home until the overnight guests are left.  make sure everybody (including you) enjoys themselves. 

 Reaction or response papers are assigned so that after reading a text, you will think carefully about what you feel or think about the text.When you write a response paper, you need to evaluate the text's strengths and weaknesses, along with if and how well the text accomplishes its objective. A reaction paper is not just a paper where you express your opinion.These papers require a close reading of the text that goes beyond the surface meaning. You must respond to implied ideas, and elaborate, evaluate, and analyze the author's purpose and main points. In many cases, you can use the first-person "I" while writing reaction papers.When you respond to the text, back up your ideas with evidence from the text along with your own connection of ideas, texts, and overarching concepts. If you are asked to agree or disagree, you have to provide convincing evidence about why you feel this way.If responding to multiple texts, you must analyze how the texts relate. If responding to one text, you probably should connect the text to overarching concepts and themes you have discussed in the class. The same assignment may also be given to films, lectures, field trips, labs, or even class discussions.A reaction paper is not a summary of the text. It also does not state, "I liked this book because it was interesting" or "I hated this because it was boring."; , Before beginning your paper, you must figure out exactly what your teacher or professor is looking for. Some teachers want you to react by analyzing or evaluating the reading. Other teachers want a personal response. Make sure you understand which kind of reaction the assignment calls for.   If you are unsure, ask the teacher to clarify what they expect from the assignment. You may be asked to react to the text in light of another text. If this is the case, you will want to use quotations from both texts in your writing. You may be asked to react to the text in the light of the class themes. For example, if you read a book in a Sociology of Gender Roles class, you will want to read, annotate, and react based on how gender roles are described in the book. You may be asked to react personally to the text. This is less common, but occasionally the teacher simply wants to know if you have read the text and thought about it. In this case, you should focus on your opinions of the book.  To complete a reaction paper, you don't just read, give your opinion, and turn in the paper. A reaction paper synthesizes the texts, which means you take the information you read and bring it together so you can analyze and evaluate. You have to give yourself time to do the readings, but more importantly, to digest what you've read so you can put the ideas together.One of the biggest mistakes that students make is waiting until the last minute to read and react. A reaction is a thoughtful consideration after reading and rereading several times. You may need to reread the text multiple times. First, to read and familiarize yourself with the text, then again to start thinking about the assignment and your reactions.  After you read through the first time, jot down your initial reactions to the text. Do the same thing on any subsequent readings.   Try completing some of the following sentences after you read: I think that..., I see that..., I feel that..., It seems that..., or In my opinion..., As you read through the text again, annotate it. Annotating in the margins of the text allows you to easily locate quotations, plot lines, character development, or reactions to the text. If you fail to annotate thoroughly, it will be more difficult to create a cohesive reaction paper.  As you read the text, you have to start questioning the text. This is where your evaluation of the material and your reaction begins. Some questions to consider include:   What issues or problems does the author address? What is the author's main point? What points or assumptions does the author make, and how does she back that up? What are strengths and weaknesses? Where are problems with the argument? How do the texts relate? (if multiple texts) How do these ideas connect to the overall ideas of the class/unit/etc?, Start by freewriting your reactions and evaluations of the author's ideas. Try to put into words what you think the author is trying to do and whether you agree or disagree. Then ask yourself why, and explain why you think these things. Freewriting is a great way to start getting your ideas on paper and getting past that initial writer's block.When you finish, read back over what you've just written. Determine what your strongest and most convincing reactions are. Prioritize your points.  Reaction papers have to be critical and have some evaluation of the text. Otherwise, you are just summarizing what you read. After freewriting, decide what your angle is. Keep asking yourself the same questions as you craft a coherent reaction.   Think about why the author has written the article or story as they have. Why did he structure things in this particular way? How does this relate to the outside world?, Now that you have completed your freewriting and found your angle, you can now shape this into an argument. What interesting thing do you have to say about what you just read? Start to state why what you said is interesting and important. This is the core of your reaction paper. Take all your points, opinions, and observations, and combine them into one claim that you will prove. This is your thesis.   Your thesis will be one statement that explains what you will analyze, criticize, or try to prove about the text. It will force your reaction paper to remain focused.  Your paper should follow basic essay format. It needs an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. Each body paragraph should directly support your thesis. In each body paragraph, you should be reacting to a different portion of the text. Organize your reactions together into a few common topics so you can write them into paragraphs.   For example, if you are reacting to a theme in a book, you can split the paragraphs into how the setting, antagonist, and figurative imagery communicate the themes successfully or unsuccessfully.  After you organize your ideas into paragraphs, you need to find quotations that will support your points. You must back up your claims with evidence from the text. Look at your annotations for quotations that support your thesis.   Draft paragraphs that introduce quotations, analyze them, and comment on them., Your paragraphs should always start with a topic sentence. Then you have to decide how to structure your paragraph. You can start with what the author says and follow that with your reaction. Or you can start with the author and then follow with how your reaction contrasts. You generally want to start with what the author says first and follow it with your reaction.A good way to think about structuring your paragraph is: detail, example/quotation, commentary/evaluation, repeat.  Make sure your introductory paragraph states the name of the text, the author, and the focus of your paper. You may also want to include the year of publication and the publication it was taken from if relevant. It is also good to include the topic of the text and the author's purpose.   The last sentence of your introduction should be your thesis.  Although most reaction papers don't ask specifically for your personal opinion, you should be critiquing, analyzing, and evaluating the text, rather than just sticking to the facts.   Look for places where you simply report what the texts says instead of providing a critique or evaluation of what the text says.  One good way to analyze and evaluate the text is to connect it to other ideas you've discussed in the class. How does this text compare to other texts, authors, themes, or time periods?   If you have been asked to give a statement about your personal opinion, the conclusion may be the best place to insert it. Some teachers may allow you to state the personal opinions in the body paragraphs. Make sure to double check with the teacher first.  Since reaction papers are usually short, you don't want them to be long. They can range from 500 words to 5 pages. Make sure to read your assignment carefully to make sure you follow directions.   Read through for clarity. Are your sentences clear? Have you supported and fully argued your points? Is there any place where you're confusing?  , Proof by reading for grammar errors. Look for run ons, fragments, verb tense issues, and punctuation errors. Check for spelling.  Double check your assignment guidelines. Make sure you have followed your teacher's directions. If you did, it is ready to submit.  

understand the purpose of a reaction paper.  figure out what the assignment is asking.  read the text you are assigned right after it is assigned.  write down your initial reactions.  annotate the text as you read.  question as you read.  freewrite.  decide on your angle.  determine your thesis.  organize your paper.  gather quotations.  structure your paragraphs.  write your introduction.  reread your reaction paragraphs to ensure you make a stance.  explain the greater implications of the text for the class, author, audience, or yourself.  edit for clarity and length.  proof and spell check your document.  ask yourself if you responded to the assignment adequately. 

 When horses defecate in their stalls, parasite larvae can crawl up the sides of the stall walls. If your horse licks the walls, it could ingest the larvae and become infected. Clean the stall to prevent parasite infections.At a minimum, muck the stalls once a day. Tips for cleaning horse stalls are below:Use proper cleaning equipment: metal pitchfork, broom, scrub brush, a large bucket to hold the manure, and a wheelbarrow. Keep your horse out of the stall when cleaning. Either tie up your horse outside the stall or put it out on pasture. Remove the manure with the pitchfork and place the manure in the wheelbarrow. Sift the bedding through the pitchfork to minimize how much bedding you need to replace. Clean the water bucket with clean water and a scrub brush. For an intensive cleaning, remove everything from the stall to sweep and disinfect the floors and walls. Disinfect the water bucket as well. Allow the stall to dry completely before restocking the stall. 10% bleach is a good disinfectant.  If your horse eats off the ground, it could ingest parasite larvae while eating. To prevent this, put your horse’s food in a rack or trough.Clean the rack or trough regularly with clean water and a scrub brush., Adult bot flies tend to lay their eggs on the insides of a horse’s knees, where a horse could easily lick them up.The eggs are tiny and white. To remove them, you can use a fine-toothed comb or a dull blade.   If you use a dull blade, be careful not nick your horse’s skin and cause bleeding. Bot knifes are also available that can remove the eggs. In addition, you could use sandpaper or a synthetic stone grooming block.  

clean your horse’s stall regularly.  feed your horse from a rack or trough.  remove bot eggs from your horse’s coat.

 The non-porousness of the board is what allows the ink to come off easily, as a clean, Teflon-like coating protects the board from letting ink set in. But scratches and "tears" in this coating will allow the ink to seep through, ruining your board permanently. Always use soft, clean towels and rags.   Adhesives like tape and glue will also rip up the coating when removed., Regular cleanings will be essential to prevent the need to restore the board in the first place. A light spray of cleaner and a towel will remove marks before the set in, keeping your board beautiful for years to come.   Any marker left on for more than 24 hours is at risk to leave "ghost" marks. Very stubborn stains can be removed with a little propyl alcohol. Wipe and dry it off after applying -- don't let it dry on the board., Work quickly, then erase with a dry, clean eraser to get most of these marks off.   Note, if you work too slowly you may dry the black marker on their, completely defeating the purpose! You can also use this method to spot clean certain marks. Just make sure they are completely covered with ink before erasing., Most soaps break up oils and sheens that are not water-soluble, helping cut through tough stains and chemicals. But the sheen on a whiteboard is there on purpose, allowing the markers to write without ever truly drying out. Never use a cleaner that isn't made to specifically work with your white board.   In a pinch, denatured alcohol can work as a more powerful cleaner than water, and it shouldn't harm whatever original finish you have left.  Don't let the board air dry. If you're wiping the board down at the end of the day, take a paper towel and clean rag and dry it as well. This will help protect the longevity of the board.  Blot it on a kitchen towel. If you need to wash it, dampen a soft cloth and run over it to remove traces of ink, but do not wet it. You want to start with as little dust and debris as possible to keep the board clean and smooth.  If someone has ruined the finish with a heavy cleaner, or you find that you have to add WD-40 more and more frequently, you'll likely hit the end of the line with your board. While you can try to resurface it again, you'll likely be best off with a new, factory sprayed finish.   WD-40 will make the board usable again, but it may also lead to slightly streaky writing. It is nothing that makes the board unusable, but it should be noted.  

never use abrasive or scratching motions to clean a whiteboard.  use whiteboard cleaner and a dry towel at the end of every week to keep the board clean.  remove "ghost marks" or permanent marker by completely covering the board in black dry-erase marker, then erasing it quickly the wet marker actually has chemicals that keep the ink fluid, which will temporarily loosen the ghost marks or permanent marker.  never use degreasers, soap, or cleaners not specifically formulated for dry-erase boards.  always dry off a board after wiping it clean with a wet rag.  clean the dry eraser regularly to prevent build up of dust and marker residue.  know that restoration will only work so many times before you need a new board. 

 Friends, family, co-workers and neighbors are great resources when you need to find a service care provider. You might also ask your doctor or pharmacist. Good questions to ask include: What they like about the dentist and/or office? Is there anything they don’t like about it? Ask how long they typically wait, and how available the dentist is for questions or emergencies.; , Find a dentist near you who is a member of the American Dental Association by visiting their website.You can also find dentists through the online yellow pages and other advertising sites.   Be wary of any advertising that claims a dentist’s service is “superior” to others’. This is considered unethical in most states., Your health insurance provider can likely provide a list of dentists participating in their coverage. You can also call faculty members at a dental school, if there is one near you, or a local hospital to see if they have an accredited dental service.You can also call the Academy of General Dentistry’s referral line—1-877-2XA-YEAR. Call your state dental society and ask for a list of recommendations. These associations can provide a list of ADA member dentists., If you have dental insurance, be sure to ask any prospective dentists if they accept your plan. Many smaller companies have a limited number of participating dentists, and dental work can be extremely expensive.  Dentists must either be a doctor of dental surgery (DDS) or a doctor of dental medicine (DMD). These degrees are equivalent and require the same coursework, including two years or pre-dental college classes and four years of dental school.They also must pass national and state exams to be licensed practitioners.Call and ask the office from which school this dentist earned his or her degree.Also ask how long they have been with this particular practice, and how long they have been practicing in general. A newly graduated dentist might have both advantages and disadvantages over an established dentist, particularly in terms of availability, cost, experience with difficult cases, and approachability, but it is really a personal preference. The important thing is that they can answer these questions. Do they regularly attend conferences or take continuing education classes?You may want a dentist who stays up-to-date on the latest health information and techniques, especially if you plan to have major work done on your teeth.  Dentists can also get certified by state boards to specialize in certain areas after completing at least two years of advanced schooling.If you know you need a certain type of work done or are looking for a dentist for your child, you might want to find a specialist in one of these areas:Endodontics (root canal therapy) Oral Pathology (dealing with oral cancer or lesions) or Surgery (removal of teeth and tissues) Orthodontics (braces and repositioning teeth) Pediatric Dentistry (cares exclusively for children and teens) Periodontics (care of gums) Prosthodontics (full mouth rehabilitation)  , Each state has an online registry on which you can track any history of claims made against a dentist practicing in that state. Google your state’s board of dentistry to find their website.Be wary of dentists with cases brought against them for misconduct or patient dissatisfaction.  If you found the dentist online, check for reviews on websites like Google and Yelp. If you were referred to this dentist by a friend or saw their ad somewhere, call and ask if they can provide a list of references.   Be wary of reviews on the office’s or dentist’s own webpage. Consider them in conjunction with those on other sites they are not associated with. A bad review or two doesn’t mean the dentist is no good. Read the whole review and assess whether there was a good reason for giving a dentist a lower score.  Are their hours flexible according to your work schedule? Is the practice located conveniently near your home or office? Do they have emergency hours or dentists on call at all times?   Not all dentists will meet all of these preferences. Decide which is/are the most important to you. If you do not get paid time off for medical visits, you will probably prefer a dentist with a wider range of hours. If you drive an SUV that gets ten miles to the gallon or have to take your children to multiple extracurricular activities, you may put location at the top of your list.  Before scheduling any dental work or appointments, ask for a consultation so you can visit the office, meet the dentist, and ask him or her questions about the service they would provide you.Questions for the dentist include: what kinds of anesthesia do they use?; do they provide anything special to help you feel more comfortable during dental work, like noise cancelling headphones?; will they go over all procedures with you in detail and answer any questions you have? Questions for the office staff include: what is the policy regarding missed appointments?; how long in advance must you cancel for no fee?; does the office have dentists on call at all times, and if so, how do patients reach them? You might also want to ask for price estimates on common procedures, so you can compare their costs with other dentists you are considering.To perform pricing research for your procedure, you may access a credible source to obtain surveys directed to dental pricing per geographic region and dentist specialty.  Make sure the office is clean and examination rooms are sterilized properly. Determine how friendly and helpful the office staff and dentist are in general.A rude office staff will make all of your visits frustrating, and might make you feel taken advantage of since you are paying for services you could get elsewhere. If the staff isn’t respectful, walk out and find another office to visit. If the dentists and staff are rude to each other, this could indicate a bad working environment. You want to visit an office where everybody gets along and is able to work together in your best interest.  This exam includes a cleaning and x-rays. Evaluate how well you get along with the dentist, how comfortable you feel with them and their office and whether they do a complete job. Do they show interest in your health? Do they ask you questions about your medical history? If not, then at most they are “putting out fires” instead of addressing underlying problems. Move on to your second choice. Are they personable? Do they exhibit patience and explain anything you don’t understand completely? If they cannot explain why you have to have a treatment or procedure, then maybe you don’t really need it. And if they aren’t concerned with making you as comfortable as possible, you aren’t getting the best treatment money can buy. Do they demonstrate professionalism, including valuing your time and money?  

ask people you know for a recommendation.  look online.  call a health care organization for a referral.  make sure they take your health care plan.  check their qualifications.  decide if you require a particular specialization.  check with the state dental board.  look for online reviews or ask for references.  determine their convenience for you.  schedule a consultation and ask about their general practices.  assess the professionalism of the office and all staff.  schedule a general exam. 

   Take your foot off the gas. Put the vehicle in neutral. This will allow the car to gradually slow down. Put the vehicle back in an appropriate gear once the vehicle regains traction. Refrain from steering the vehicle. The skidding of the tires will help the vehicle slow down. As the vehicle slows, the car will pick up traction again. As the vehicle slows down, turn the steering wheel in the direction you want the vehicle to go.  

know what to do in the event the front wheels begin to slide. 

 It’s best to keep the “enemy” part of your friendship to yourself. It can be really tempting to share all of your negative thoughts with friends, but you don’t want to sink to your frenemy’s level. If the goal is to keep things running smoothly, gossiping will ruin that by stirring things up.This will also keep your frenemy from getting between you and your true friends. By observing the frenemy’s trash talking as well as your lack of it, your true friends will see you more clearly as the trustworthy one.  Do your best not to react emotionally when facing a frustrating challenge involving your frenemy. Your frenemy will most likely find satisfaction in getting a rise out of you, so it’s best to keep a cool head and act like nothing’s bothering you. Turning the other cheek will also make you appear more kind to you and your frenemy’s mutual friends., Counter the negative things that your frenemy says and does to keep problems from developing.   If you know your frenemy always bails on the plans you make together, always have a back-up plan. If your frenemy has a passionate view of religion that you disagree with, consider steering clear of that subject while talking to them.If your frenemy always has to be right, ask them a question about something they said that you disagree with instead of challenging them., It might be easier to deal with your frenemy if you look at things from their perspective. If they find it so necessary to be nasty and mean to you, there’s probably a reason for it and it may have nothing to do with you. While this doesn’t justify their meanness, understanding where they’re coming from may help you take it with a grain of salt.Maybe your frenemy is having problems at home and doesn’t know how to handle their stress in a positive way. Your frenemy may act mean in an attempt to hide their own insecurities.  

don’t gossip about your frenemy.  stay calm, cool, and collected.  don’t let yourself be affected by their negativity.  put yourself in your frenemy’s shoes. 

 Either consciously or unconsciously, many people change their signature over the years. Knowing when a given autograph was produced will help you spot a fake. Compare another autograph from the same time period to the one you’re, Knowing the provenance of the autograph means tracing the line of ownership back to the moment when the autograph was created. Ask the current owner of the autograph how they came to acquire it. If they claim they are not the first owner of the autograph, follow up with the person who sold them the autograph to find out more about its origin. Continue down the chain of ownership as far as possible.If you have a video or a photo that depicts the creation of the autograph you’re trying to verify, your job will be much easier. Just compare the autographed item in the video or photo to the actual object. If the two are different, you’ve spotted a fake. If you’ve nobody to talk to about an autograph’s provenance, look for corroborating documents. For instance, if someone autographs a particular item and then writes in their diary that they did so, you could use that information to establish that the autograph is authentic. You could also, in some cases, ask the supposed author of the autograph directly if they recognize the autograph as their own.  If you’re evaluating an autograph of historical significance, the paper or ink from that era should be identifiable as such. Ensure that the ink or paper from the era in which the autograph was supposedly created is historically accurate.Paper produced between 1900 and 1945, for instance, was far less absorbent than paper today. If the autograph you’re evaluating purportedly dates from that period but shows a “bleeding effect” (an uneven ink trim around each character), the autograph was likely produced by a newer pen pressed against older paper, which was less absorbent than modern paper.Like most efforts to spot a fake autograph, this is far from foolproof. Forgers often go to great lengths to produce fake autographs. They might use special inks or blank pages that really date from the historical period in which the autograph was allegedly produced. They might also artificially age photos or papers to create the appearance that they are older than they really are., Almost every industry that produces autographed collectibles – sports, film, TV, and so on – also has at least one independent autograph authentication service. For instance, if you’re interested in autographs of golfers, you should get authenticated through the Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA) or a similar organization., The only real way to identify whether a particular autograph is the product of an autopen or other machine signature device is to compare it to a known machine-produced signature. Lay the two signatures over each other on a light table or beneath a strong light source. If they align perfectly, both were machine-produced.Many people who use autopens or other mechanical signature machines to sign things have more than one signature loaded in the machine’s memory. In order to know for sure that a particular autograph was or was not produced by a machine, you need to know how many machine-produced versions of their autograph the individual in question used. Then, compare your autographed object or document against all known variations. It is possible to have an authentic document that has been “signed” by autopen. In other words, a machine-signed letter from the president still qualifies as an example of presidential correspondence (though it will fetch far less than a document containing a hand-signed autograph).Machines that mechanically reproduce signatures are often used in business and government. Machine signatures are also found on books, sporting equipment, and photos.  

know the date when the autograph was produced.  identify the provenance.  evaluate the ink or paper.  use an authenticator.  beware of machine signatures. 

 Pay attention to the whole game, don't drift in and out. Decide which player you like the most by watching the plays he makes on the field and his interviews after the game (their personality is important too!).; , This can help you hold your own in conversations with even lifelong die-hards. , This can result in a sharing of enthusiasm about the team, or during the club's more worse hours: a shared sorrow. Regardless of which feeling it is, it is better to not go through it alone.  Tickets can be purchased directly from the Mets online, at the stadium box office in person, or from a secondhand ticket seller such as StubHub.   Getting to a game can be a great way to spend time with Mets fan friends you have, or to meet new friends who support the Mets!  , Don't be the guy or girl that talks about their love for the Mets but doesn't know who David Wright is. Go to mets.com or a similar site, and look up the current roster. For the key players, know some crucial tidbits (name, position, basic stats) to help you hold your own in conversations about the team. , See the team whenever you can. If you live in the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, you may have the chance to relatively easily see the Mets in cities such as Philadelphia, Washington DC, Boston, and Baltimore. Take advantage of these opportunities if they come about.  Don't be the guy shouting on Twitter about how the Mets ABSOLUTELY MUST TRADE players x, y, and z after said players came up short. Be rational.  Put up Mets paraphernalia around the home and office. Throw some Mets items into your wardrobe (Mets jackets for the winter months can be purchased online and offer a stylish way to show your team pride year-round).  

start watching mets games.  learn about the mets history (they won the world series in 1969 and 1986, were created in 1962, etc) and research some team trivia.  buy a mets jersey (or t-shirt if price is a concern) to show your team pride as you go about your day.  ,  have conversations with other mets fans.  get tickets to see the mets at citi field, if you can manage to make the trip.  know the current team.  watch or listen to as many games as possible, and always stay in the know team-wise so you can intelligently discuss the mets with fellow mets fans.  ,  get to as many games as possible.  stay calm after mets losses.  promote the mets every day. 

 They should be side by side. Make one slightly larger than the other. Make sure they're not too far apart. That is key in this drawing.  Draw a line that goes down and goes on top of the ovals you've made. Then draw one under it doing the same. On the bottom one, bend in a little in between ovals. Then draw the beginnings of legs, like drawn in the picture. Make the bottom and top lines go up, then draw a circle for the beginning of a head. Draw a nose by drawing an oval that's partially in the head.  Do the same to the head as you did to the body. After this, erase the circles in the body and head. Add ears to the head that are either long and floppy, or short and up. Then add either a short or long tail. At this point, it's good to have a selected breed in mind, as this it where all the details are.  Carefully erase all of your circles and ovals. Then add fur by drawing ruffles on the outlines. You can also smudge the pencil lead lightly to create shadows or darker spots on the dog.Your dog should be very realistic!  , 

draw two ovals.  make an outline.  draw lines outlining the head.  erase all inner circles.  finished.  

 Hold your body upright and stand tall. If you decide to sit, make sure your back is straight so that you will be able to hold the flute in front of your body comfortably.Keep your body relaxed.; , Hold the long tube end of the flute in a handshake grip with your right hand. Position the flute vertically so that the tubes are parallel to your body. Use your left hand to gently hold the end of the flute with the short tubes.The pan flute is typically curved. Position the flute’s curve toward your body. Keep the pan flute horizontally aligned with your head. So if your head tilts one way or the other, the flute should also tilt to remain aligned with your head., Keep your arms relaxed as you hold the pan flute. This will allow you to easily move it back and forth so that you can blow into different tubes.  Your embouchure is the positioning and shaping of your mouth and lips in order to control your airflow when you play a pan flute. To form your embouchure, first make a slight smile and purse your lips a bit.Make a small opening between your lips. Position the pan flute against your bottom lip and direct air into the pipe’s tube, just like you would if you blew into a bottle.   Move the bottom of the flute slightly away from your or closer to you to adjust the direction of the air flow into the tube. Adjust the position of the tube’s top higher or lower depending on your mouth and lips to produce a good quality sound.Tighten up your lips/embouchure when you are playing the higher notes (shorter tubes). Relax your embouchure when you play lower notes (longer tubes).  

sit or stand in an upright, relaxed position.  hold the pan flute with both hands.  relax your arms.  form the correct embouchure. 

 The natural oils on your skin can corrode the exterior of your guitar strings.You may even notice the strings losing color and developing bits of rust. To combat this, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before playing to extend the life of your strings and keep them grime-free.   Avoid applying perfumes or lotions to your hands before playing, as they are not suited for guitar strings and their ingredients may cause damage.; , When first learning to play the guitar, it’s natural to press on the strings firmly as you gauge proper finger position. Once you have a better command of playing, though, you can actually use much less pressure to achieve your desired notes.Doing this will help minimize excessive pressure of your metal frets against the strings, which can cause physical wear to their exteriors and shorten their longevity.  When you push a string tightly over the fret board so the pitch goes up—a technique often used in rock and blues music—it strains the string. While this effect can sound desirable, doing this excessively can damage the string’s internal structure, causing it to wear out more quickly.Nylon strings have a higher tolerance for string bends than metal strings, which tend to have more trouble snapping back into their original shape.  If you play your guitar with your fingers rather than a pick, your nails are one of the items that most frequently touch and manipulate your strings. Uneven or jagged nails can actually cause abrasions to your strings’ exteriors, which shortens their playable life.A smooth, rounded nail shape is preferable to a square shape for guitar playing. What’s most important, though, is filing them smoothly, so no rough edges can scratch your strings.  While some tinkering is necessary to properly tune your guitar, most amateur guitar players manipulate string tension far more than is necessary. If your guitar is in tune, try not to mess around tightening and loosening the strings just for fun.   Excessive slackening and tightening wears down the interior structure of the strings, causing their integrity to break down over time.Avoiding this will help increase string life. Try to stick with one method of tuning to preserve your strings. That way you’re not manipulating them excessively by switching between methods—for example, between standard tuning and drop-D tuning.  

wash your hands before playing.  ease up on pressure.  minimize string bends.  file your fingernails smooth.  don’t tighten and loosen strings excessively. 

 Hardiness zones are based on regional temperature averages. These colorful bands have a difference of about 10 degrees Fahrenheit from one to the next.   Each zone is further divided into subzone a or b, with the former being 5 degrees (Fahrenheit) cooler than the latter. One’s official zone indicates the lowest or highest possible temperature in their area during a normal year.; , Gardeners should check plant tags and purchase specimens that are considered suitable for their particular zone.   For example, a perennial that is classified as being for zones 8 to 10 would probably not survive the winter in zone 6. Likewise, gardeners in zone 11 would have a hard time getting the aforementioned plant through the summer.  The hardiness zone map is not a completely infallible resource but it is good as a general guide. Some of the faults with the map are outlined below:   Though efforts have been made to incorporate known microclimates into the updated map, the revised edition may not account for all of the nuances that are out there. The plant hardiness zones don't take into account extreme weather patterns, so gardeners who are experiencing unseasonably cold or warm periods may experience some plant loss as a result. Growers should keep in mind that some specimens that are said to grow in their zone may not necessarily thrive there. After all, there are many factors besides temperature which may account for a perennial’s overall success or failure.  The USDA has published a USDA Hardiness Zone Map which makes it easier to determine your exact zone. Go to the website and click on your state. A detailed map of the state that includes major cities will pop up to show you exactly which zone you live in.   To make this map, the USDA gathered average low winter temperature data for all areas throughout the United States and then grouped areas with similar temperatures together to form zones. Each individual zone is 10 degrees F warmer or cooler than the zones adjacent to it. For instance, USDA Hardiness Zone 5 is assigned to areas where the average winter low is between -20 and -10 degrees F. USDA Hardiness Zone 6 is assigned to areas where the average winter low is between -10 and 0 degrees F (an average of 10 degrees warmer than zone 5). And USDA Hardiness Zone 4 is assigned to areas where the average winter low is between -30 and -20 degrees F (an average of 10 degrees colder than zone 5). The zones are further subdivided into 5-degree Fahrenheit increments. USDA Hardiness Zone 5A winter lows are between -20 and -15 degrees Fahrenheit while zone 5B is -15 to -10 degrees Fahrenheit.  The range of average annual minimum winter temperatures for each zone on the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone map is as follows:Zone 0:   a: < −53.9 °C (−65 °F)  b: −53.9 °C (−65 °F) to −51.1 °C (−60 °F)    Zone 1:   a: −51.1 °C (−60 °F) to −48.3 °C (−55 °F)  b: −48.3 °C (−55 °F) to −45.6 °C (−50 °F)    Zone 2:   a: −45.6 °C (−50 °F) to −42.8 °C (−45 °F)  b: −42.8 °C (−45 °F) to −40 °C (−40 °F)    Zone 3:   a: −40 °C (−40 °F) to −37.2 °C (−35 °F)  b: −37.2 °C (−35 °F) to −34.4 °C (−30 °F)    Zone 4:   a: −34.4 °C (−30 °F) to −31.7 °C (−25 °F)  b: −31.7 °C (−25 °F) to −28.9 °C (−20 °F)    Zone 5:   a: −28.9 °C (−20 °F) to −26.1 °C (−15 °F)  b: −26.1 °C (−15 °F) to −23.3 °C (−10 °F)    Zone 6:   a: −23.3 °C (−10 °F) to −20.6 °C (−5 °F)  b: −20.6 °C (−5 °F) to −17.8 °C (0 °F)    Zone 7:   a: −17.8 °C (0 °F) to −15 °C (5 °F)  b: −15 °C (5 °F) to −12.2 °C (10 °F)    Zone 8:   a: −12.2 °C (10 °F) to −9.4 °C (15 °F)  b: −9.4 °C (15 °F) to −6.7 °C (20 °F)    Zone 9:   a: −6.7 °C (20 °F) to −3.9 °C (25 °F)  b: −3.9 °C (25 °F) to −1.1 °C (30 °F)    Zone 10:   a: −1.1 °C (30 °F) to +1.7 °C (35 °F)  b: +1.7 °C (35 °F) to +4.4 °C (40 °F)    Zone 11:   a: +4.4 °C (40 °F) to +7.2 °C (45 °F)  b: +7.2 °C (45 °F) to +10 °C (50 °F)    Zone 12:   a: +10 °C (50 °F) to +12.8 °C (55 °F)  b: > +12.8 °C (55 °F)    , While the average low temperature in the winter is a big factor in determining which plants will grow in your zone, the average high summer temperatures must also be considered.   Many plants cannot take the heat in hot southern climates. This high end of a plant’s temperature tolerance is actually taken into consideration when a plant is assigned a zone range. For instance, Japanese spirea (Spiraea japonica) is hardy in USDA Hardiness Zones 4 to 8. This means it will only thrive in climates where winter temperatures drop to below 20 degrees Fahrenheit. It will not grow well in the mild winters and hot summers of USDA Hardiness Zone 9 or higher.  Living in warmer climates in the west, south and along the coast can make finding your gardening zone a little more complicated. These areas are riddled with microclimates that are influenced by elevation. Temperatures within these microclimates are not the norm for the general area.   Fortunately, “Sunset Magazine” has gathered information about these microclimates to help gardeners purchase the right plants. Go to their “Plant Finder” page, click on “What is your Sunset Climate Zone?” and simply enter your zip code. Sunset climate zone tolerances are not often listed for plants purchased through the mail, though. So when you live in these warmer areas, it is better to go to a local nursery or garden center to purchase plants. They will be very familiar with these microclimates and can recommend the right plants for your gardening zone.  The best time to plant trees, shrubs and perennials depends to some extent on your USDA Hardiness Zone.   In Zones 9 through 1, where temperatures dip to below freezing during the winter, deciduous trees and shrubs should be planted right around the first killing frost in the fall. Evergreens and perennial plants should be planted right after the last hard frost in the spring. If evergreens are planted in the fall, they often sustain damage to the leaves due to drying winter winds and cold temperatures. The Farmer’s Almanac is a very helpful resource when trying to determine when the first and last frosts usually occur in your area. In USDA Hardiness Zones 10 and above where temperatures rarely drop below freezing, the best time to plant trees and shrubs is in late fall, winter or very early spring to give the plants time to get established before the heat of the summer. Perennials should be planted after the last frost in the spring.  Take the ever-fluctuating climate into consideration when selecting trees, shrubs and perennials. All areas throughout the United States experience unusual highs and lows from time to time.   Determine your Hardiness Zone then choose plants that are rated hardy for at least one Zone higher and one Zone lower to insure the plant will survive an unexpected extreme.  

understand what is meant by a plant hardiness zone.  check plant tags to find the recommended zone for planting.  recognize the issues with the plant hardiness scale.  use the usda zone map to find your exact plant hardiness zone.  familiarize yourself with the temperature scale.  take a plant's heat tolerance into account.  consider whether you live within a microclimate.  know that planting times will vary according to your hardiness zone.  play it safe. 

; , Make sure that the draw is sitting steadily and is not wobbling or threatening to fall on the floor.  Make sure that it fits across the space snugly and is not going to slip or fall into the drawer or off the drawer.  When you need to move it, it's as easy as lifting it up and either washing it or putting it somewhere temporarily.  

get a sturdy chopping (bread) board.  open up a kitchen drawer at the top level.  rest the chopping board across the drawer.  use your newfound preparation space. 

 You must do this so that you can identify what you need to obtain and what you already have that you can utilize.; , Each person will need at least:   One napkin One glass One knife One fork One spoon  , Choose whatever accent colour you like if you'd like to have an accent. If you don't want an accent colour, then remember that you will almost certainly have to add gold or silver for flatware, unless you can obtain white flatware. Some accent colours you may wish to consider are the following:   Red Navy blue Forest Green Gold Silver  , White is a popular colour for tablecloths; you shouldn't have too many issues finding one you like in a store or shop, or even online if you don't already have one. Thrift stores, second hand shops and charity shops might have interesting vintage or even antique table cloths. Your tablecloth doesn't have to be plain white fabric; you can use a damask cloth, a cloth with borderie anglaise edging, an embroidered cloth, or whatever you choose, as long as it's winter white. Make sure your chosen cloth is clean and pressed. If you want to economize, a very well-ironed white sheet folded in two may suffice. ,, Ideally, these will match your tablecloth perfectly. Fold the napkins in a fancy way if you know how; if not, fold them into quarters. Consider napkin rings for your winter white table. Napkin rings can be a great way to introduce your accent colour or emphasize the winter white theme.   If you choose silver, gold or plain white napkin rings, consider tucking a sprig of holly or a small sprig of evergreen foliage into the napkin ring along with the napkin. If you can't match your tablecloth exactly, then you could use napkins in your accent colour. This will look better than a pure white cloth and off-white napkins.  Add side plates if they will be required. Be sure to place everything correctly, if you feel this is important; this means knives on the right, side plates on the left, cutlery for each course from the outside in, and so on.  If appropriate, place a candelabra and candles on the table. Use white candles or use your accent colour. If you don't have candelabras, use candle sticks, candle holders, or even small glass jars. Your candles don't have to be tall; sometimes tall candles get in the way of dinner conversation, so utilize tea lights in appropriate holders if you prefer.  Flowers are a common table centrepiece. White flowers with dark green foliage will add to your winter white theme. Flowers may not be considered wintery by everyone, so consider an arrangement of holly, ivy, evergreen foliage, etc. White Christmas decorations, such as baubles, can be arranged as a centrepiece.  Add a water jug; a crystal jug would compliment the winter white theme. Don't put bottles of water on the table if you can avoid it; it looks a little tacky. Place a butter dish or two on the table if you are serving bread, and a bread basket or dish. If you wish, line your bread basket with a napkin.   Add a salt cellar, pepper grinder, and any other condiments required. Put sauces into dishes or bowls; it's tacky to plonk the ketchup bottle on the table. If you are having a tea party, remember the sugar bowl and milk jug.  Add confetti sparkles to the table if you like that sort of thing. Drape winter white velvet or silk ribbon along or around the table or use your accent colour. Scatter petals, real or fake, on the table. Small dried leaves, fake leaves, or evergreen foliage can also be used. Beads, pearls, sequins and small crystals can all beautify a winter white table setting.  These are another way to add your accent colour. Add markers to your guests' glasses if you like, in winter white or your accent colour.  

establish how many people you need to set the table for and decide what food you will serve.  have the necessary cutlery and tableware for each person.  decide if you are going all winter white or using an accent colour.  cover the table with a winter white tablecloth, preferably fabric.  add table mats, serving mats, and doilies (if you want to use these items).  ,  add a table runner on top of your tablecloth if you'd like.  ,  place a winter white napkin at each place setting.  place the flatware, glasses, and cutlery your guests will require at each place setting.  add decorative touches.  create and add a centrepiece, if desired.  add the communal items to the table.  decorate the table 'en masse' if you want.  add place markers if desired so each person knows where they are to sit. 

 Lubricate the tip with petroleum jelly or water based lubricant such as “KY jelly."Lubricating the thermometer will make the experience slightly less uncomfortable for your dog.   If you have a digital thermometer, turn it on and make sure that it is in working order before inserting it into the rectum. Most digital thermometers can read in Fahrenheit or Celsius. Check your thermometer’s directions to figure out how to change the type of reading. Mercury thermometers should be shaken down to the end closest to the mercury tip before inserting to ensure the most accurate reading. The mercury thermometer may have both Fahrenheit and Celsius, you will have to check your particular instrument.; , Have the other person give the dog a “hug” by placing his or her left arm under the neck of the dog and using his or her left hand to hold the side of the dog's face against the shoulder. Your helper will then place his or her right arm under the belly of the dog just in front of the back legs to keep the dog standing.   It is not uncommon for a dog to want to sit down when they feel a rectal thermometer inserted. If your dog is comfortable lying down and stays there for the temperature taking, then you can leave them lying down. Sitting is not the preferred position because the rectum will not be easily accessible., If you have any indication that the dog may bite or you may injure the dog while trying to restrain your pet, stop! It is better to wait and take your dog to its veterinarian to get its temperature taken than to risk injury to the dog or yourself.  Lift from the base of the tail, rather than the tip. This will give you more control over the animals movement and prevent the dog's tail from wagging.   It may be helpful to have your helper hold the dog's tail up for you.  Be careful not to insert the thermometer too deep, or too shallow, as this will affect the readings.Try to gently insert along the side of the rectum, particularly if there is feces present.   The anus is the opening into the rectum, which is a long tube that collects feces. The anus is a muscular sphincter that relaxes and opens to allow feces to leave the rectum. The sphincter can shut very tightly if the dog is painful or afraid. Avoid forcing the thermometer through the anus, but do aim into the middle of the pucker where you will find the least resistance for your well-lubricated thermometer. Remember to keep your hand steady and the thermometer straight. Be deliberate in your approach.  If you are using a digital thermometer, keep it in until it beeps. If you are using a mercury thermometer, leave in place for approximately two-minutes., This has probably been a very intrusive and stressful experience for your dog, so be sure to use a soft touch. Clean the thermometer off after use - rubbing alcohol works well.Remember, this is the doggy thermometer for rectal use. It should not get mixed up with thermometers you use for humans.  

prepare the thermometer.  have another individual restrain the dog's body.  be cautious.  lift the dog's tail to expose the rectum.  insert the thermometer into the dog's rectum about 1 inch (2.54 cm).  leave the thermometer inserted for the right amount of time.  remove the thermometer gently.

  The first few ants you see are “scout” ants looking for food or nesting sources. If you can address the problem while there are just a few ants, you are more likely to permanently remove them from your house.        Spray a solution of 1 part distilled white vinegar to 1 part water on entryway points or ant trails. The scout ants make trails that other ants can follow. Although this is tedious work, it can confuse them while you find your solution.      ; ,  Take a close-up photo of the ant. Email it to the office and ask what type of ant you are dealing with. Local extension offices often keep files on local plants, insects and animals.       Ask for an information packet on ridding your house or yard of this type of ants. They may be able to give you special instructions on the best methods.       If you are dealing with carpenter ants, call an exterminator immediately. They can cause structural damage in the home.   If the ant nest is outside, this indicates that there are holes in the home allowing the ants to come in and look for food.       If the ant nest is inside, it indicates that you have soft, water-damaged areas of the home that need to be reconstructed. Remove damaged sections of the wall or cabinet, so that you can set bait on the nest itself.       If you know the ant nest is inside, but you are unable to get at the area, you may want to call a professional exterminator. Shortly after, you will want to get advice from a contractor about how to repair the damage to your home.   Chemicals are more likely to produce results quickly.       Curious pets or small kids are good reasons to try natural remedies first.  Ant traps, keep the bait and chemicals inside a small plastic trap, meaning there is less mess and chemical distribution around your house.   Set the traps around ant entry points, such as windows, doorways or cracked foundations. Look for traps that bait both sweet and grease eating ants. Ants’ food preferences change throughout the year, so these traps are more versatile.  This natural remedy is extremely effective, if you have established where the nests are. It dries out the ants, killing them within 3 days.   Diatomaceous earth is a sedimentary rock made from fossilized algae. It absorbs lipids from the surface of insects, dehydrating them. You can use borax by spreading it on nests and windowsills in a similar fashion. Although borax isn’t dangerous to adults, it can be toxic in large quantities and if eaten by small children.  If you see ants away from the nest, then you can kill them where they are without using harsh chemicals.   Mix a solution of 2 tbsp. (30ml) of dishwashing liquid in 16 oz. (0.5l) of water. Pour it into a spray bottle.       Follow the ants and spritz them. Wipe up dead ants with paper towels.   Spray an insecticide on your lawn an hour after you mow it. Ants may start on the lawn and move closer to the house over time. Buy a lawn spray insecticide and repeat every year.       Trim bushes, trees and flowers that are close to the house. Letting plants touch the house creates bridges for the ants to find a pathway inside. Trim every year to avoid ant problems.       Seal up windows and foundation with sealing caulk. If you rent your home, then ask a landlord to caulk areas where you know there is a problem.   Vacuum your kitchen and dining areas daily. Even the smallest food crumbs can attract ants.       Discourage eating in other areas of the house.       Wipe counters with dishwashing liquid and water solutions or vinegar and water solutions. They will erase ant trails and clean surfaces.        

follow the ants to see where they are going and where they are originating.  get expert advice from your local university extension office.  determine if the ant nest is outside or inside.  decide if you will use chemical insecticides or natural remedies.  use ant traps.  put food-grade diatomaceous earth on nests.  spray ants directly with a dishwasher liquid solution.  stop ant infestations with yard work.  clean your house well and often. 

 If you hang up on a telemarketer right away, you’ll probably be placed on the “no answer” list, and will be called again eventually. You don’t want to engage a telemarketer in conversation either, especially if you have absolutely no interest in their product or service.   The easiest way to handle a telemarketer is to say, “Please put me on your do not call list.” If the telemarketer keeps interrupting you or a robot calls you, you might just have to hang up. If the same number persistently calls, report it to the FCC by calling 1-888-CALL-FCC or going to https://www.fcc.gov/.  If you live in the United States, you can add yourself to the do not call registry. It'll then become illegal for telemarketers to contact you: https://www.donotcall.gov/. If you do get contacted by a telemarketer after putting yourself on the list, you can report the number that called you to the FTC or FCC.  If they tell you a mutual acquaintance or other contact, consider taking the call. If they don’t or can’t tell you, or if they got your contact information from some data pool or list, ask to be removed from their call list and hang up., Be clear about conveying your annoyance with phone calls, especially if you might want to do business with or purchase something from that company but don’t want annoying callers. Make sure you provide them with an email address specifically for spam or sales deals. 

don’t just hang up right away.  add yourself to the national do not call registry.  ask where they got your contact info.  tell them “no calls, emails only.” if you’re running a business, in charge of purchasing, or otherwise need to field sales pitches from time to time, tell telemarketers that you only respond to emails. 

 Themes are packages of icons, wallpapers, fonts, screensavers, and sounds that make up the Windows user interface. You can change the entire theme at once to dramatically change the way your computer looks and feels.   Most installations of Windows only come with one or two themes installed, but many more can be downloaded from the internet.; , Open your Personalization tool in the Control Panel. For Windows 7 and 8, the theme selection window takes up the majority of the Personalization tool. You can browse through the installed themes and pick one that you’d like. If you want to search online for more, click the “Get more themes online…” link.   For Windows Vista, theme selection is a bit less user-friendly. In the Personalization menu, click the Theme link. This will open the Theme menu, where you can select installed themes from a drop-down box. In order to add more themes, you will need to manually search for them and download them to your computer. They use the file extension “.theme”.

 Planting it in a container controls its spreading, which many aquatic plants do very quickly.   Some aquatic plants can completely take over a smaller water feature within a few years and have to be controlled with chemicals or pulled out by hand.; , These plantsgrow well in USDA Hardiness Zones 7 to 10. But they will not survive temperatures below 0 °F (−18 °C).If planted in a pond, these plants must be taken out in the fall and stored in a cool, dry area where they will not be exposed to frost during the winter.  Unlike terrestrial plants that should be planted in containers with drain holes, aquatic plants do not need a container with holes as the potting soil can wash out through the holes.  Fabric pots are ideal for aquatic plants. The fabric allows water to soak into the potting soil but keeps the soil in and the flexible fabric on the bottom makes it easier to keep the plant level.Fabric pots are a bit more expensive than plastic pots, though, and harder to move when the plant is taken out of the water.  Smaller containers keep plants smaller while larger containers let them grow larger. Certain species of aquatic plants also grow better in smaller or larger containers   Hardy water lilies like the “Comanche” (Nymphaea “Comanche”),which grow well in Zones 4 to 10, and Cannas should be planted in containers that are 10 inches deep and 15 inches wide.Tropical water lilies like the “Director George T. Moore” (Nymphaea “Director George T. Moore”)which only grow well in Zones 10 and 11, should be planted in containers that are 10 inches deep and 20 inches wide. Smaller plants like the “Katie Ruellia” (Ruellia brittonia “Katie”), which grows to 5 to 10 inches tall and grows well in Zones 9 to 11, can be planted in a 5-inch deep, 8-inch wide pot to keep it them smaller or a 5-inch deep, 12-inch wide pot to let it grow a little larger., They will be able to tell you which size pot will work best for each plant.  If the soil in your yard is naturally loamy clay, it can be used for the aquatic plants., You can use a brand like PondCare Aquatic Planting Media.This mix contains kiln-fired clay pieces, provides plant nutrients and anchors the aquatic plant securely in its container. While sandy soil may keep the plant anchored, it will not hold enough nutrients to keep aquatic plants healthy.  It is too light and will leach into the water.  Then, put two to four aquatic plant fertilizer tablets on the soil spaced evenly around the container 2 to 3 inches in from the edge.   The number of tablets required varies, depending on the size of the tablets and the size of the container. There should be 1 to 2 ounces of fertilizer for each gallon of soil.Fertilizer tablets with a 12-8-8, 10-6-4, 20-10-5 or 5-10-5 ratio are fine., Do this until the container is ⅔ full.  These rhizomes are actually thickened stems that resemble sweet potatoes.   The growing end of the rhizome with growth buds or “eyes” should be placed at the center of the container with the “eyes” facing up and buried deeper than the other end so that the whole thing is sitting at a 45 degree angle. The growth buds or “eyes” look very similar to the “eyes” on a potato. This placement gives the hardy water lily room to grow in the pot.  The higher end should be just above soil level and the lower end should be covered.  Their “eyes” should be facing up and the top of the rhizome should be above soil level.Lotuses grow well in Zones 4 to 10.  Then, cover them with 2 to 3 inches of soil., Then, hold the plant in the center of the container and add more damp soil until the roots are covered.  This will help to keep the soil in the container and keep fish from displacing the soil.  The soil should be wet.  Aquatic plants that get only four hours of sunlight or less will grow very slowly or may not grow at all.  Aquatic plants such as hardy water lilies and lotus do well in these conditions.  Cannas and tropical water lilies will do well in these conditions., This will then allow sunlight to easily reach them. Bricks or overturned clay pots can be placed beneath the aquatic plant container to raise it up if the water is too deep.   Deeper water will not let the sunlight reach the plant rhizomes or roots to trigger new stem growth. Hardy water lilies grow best with 1 to 1 ½ feet of water covering the container. Tropical water lilies do fine with 6 to 12 inches of water over the container but lotus grow in 4 to 6 inches of water.Cannas grow well up above the water.They should be placed so that the top of the container is 6 to 8 inches deep.  Adjust this to 6 to 8 inches if the pond gets more than six hours of sunlight.   Lotus should be submerged to a depth of only 2 inches until they begin to grow. After the aquatic plants reach 4 to 6 inches tall, they can be moved into deeper water.  They will break. Instead, lift the container by grasping it at the top with one hand on either side to hold it level or grasp it at the top on one side, tilt it just enough to get a hand underneath and move it with one hand on the bottom and one hand at the top of the container.  This will keep the gravel from spilling over the side of the container.  

plant your aquatic plant in a container before putting it in water.  grow tropical and subtropical water plants like cannas (canna spp) in a container.  do not use a container with drain holes.  use plastic pots without holes, or fabric pots.  select a container based on how large you want the aquatic pot to grow.  ask a sales associate at an aquatic plant nursery if you are not sure what size container you should use.  use loamy clay for aquatic plants.  buy commercially manufactured aquatic plant potting mix if the native soil is sandy or very heavy clay.  do not use potting soil that is formulated for regular, terrestrial potted plants.  if you are planting a rhizome, pour moistened soil into the container until it is ⅓ full.  add more damp soil.  if you’re growing a hardy water lily rhizome, place it at an angle and to one side of the container.  place additional damp soil into the container over the rhizome.  if you’re growing tropical water lily and lotus (nelumbo nucifera) rhizomes, center them in the pot.  if you’re growing cannas, plant them in the center of the container.  for other types of aquatic plants with roots instead of rhizomes, fill the container with ⅔ to ¾ damp soil.  add ½ to ¾ inch of pea gravel over the top of the soil for all aquatic plants.  water the aquatic plant right after planting.  plant the aquatic plants in the spring or early summer in a water feature that gets at least six hours of sunlight each day.  plant aquatic plants hardy enough to survive cooler temperatures in water that is 50 °f (10 °c).  plant tropical and subtropical aquatics in water that is over 70 °f (21 °c).  place them in a spot where there is no more than 6 to 8 inches of water above the pot.  if the pond gets only six hours of sunlight each day, place them at a depth of 6 inches.  do not lift the plant by its stems.  keep the container as level as possible when moving it. 

 Arguably the most important thing you can do in preparing for your first day is making sure you have all of the equipment you need. The types of materials you'll need will vary from class to class. A lot of high school classes will have some sort of online webpage that will post the recommended materials you should bring. Print off a copy for each list of materials and take them to an office supplies store. Certain things, like pens and paper, will be used for virtually all classes, so you can buy a single stack for use throughout your school year. Here are some things you'll almost certainly need for your first day:  A backpack with comfortable shoulder straps A sturdy binder, filled with ruled paper Pens (red and black) and HB pencils Spiral-bound notebooks; one for each class you're enrolled in A pair of scissors A scientific calculator and graphed paper, if you're doing mathematics A small vial of hand sanitizer A portable USB drive, for saving computer work.; , Choose the clothes you'll wear for the week and ensure that they're cleaned and prepared for wearing, including ironing if needed. Polish your shoes and check that you've got fresh underwear as well. It can speed things up to decide ahead of each day what you'll wear if you don't have a uniform., Make the parts of your lunch that you can make the night before and place in the fridge. The next morning, take the made things from the fridge, add these and any packaged things to your lunch bag and finish up the last things needed. This will speed up time for you each day. (Don't expect your parents to keep making your lunches, you can definitely do it and in doing so, can decide what you'll be getting!), Depending on what time your school starts, when your bus comes, or when your parents have to leave, wake up about an hour and a half beforehand to prepare yourself. Example: Your bus comes at 7:00 and you have to be there 5 minutes before it comes you should wake up at about 5:30. Yeah, it's early, but it's worth it.  Once you wake up, go and eat a good breakfast. Have eggs, toast, cereal that's not too sugary, etc. No toaster pastries, but do not skip breakfast. you'll regret it all day.  After that, go to the bathroom and shower, if you didn't the night before. If you did, quickly freshen up by putting deodorant on. And body spray, or perfume, or whatever. Make yourself smell nice. If one day you forget to shower and don't have time in the morning, at least rinse your hair some and maybe try "dry shampoo" spray.  Don't skip this. Do you really want people to smell morning breath? Everyone has it. Brush for at least 3 minutes for that extra whiteness. It will make your smile much more flattering and approachable. If you want to whiten up your smile a bit try mixing lime or lemon juice with baking soda and scrub your teeth with it, then brush your teeth, but only once a week, or else it will weaken your teeth.  Some great hair ideas are the classic ponytail, curled pigtails, waves, French braids, or just simply wear your hair down. Curl, straighten, part...the possibilities are endless. Do not overdo it. But don't under do it either. Make it look like your hair required effort. And please, if you do shower in the morning, dry your hair before you leave. Wet head = bad impression.  Ahh, clothes. Make sure everything thing you want to wear is clean and set out the night before.   Pick out the bottoms. Jeans are cool, slacks say serious, shorts say laid back, a skirt says girly, and a dress says Wow, someone tried hard this morning.       Shirt. Not a long sleeve, it is likely too hot, because no matter where you are, students typically start school in August or September. So short sleeved, or tank top if the school allows it. Make it a good one,       Shoes. They should complement the colors in your outfit and share the same "style".       Accessories. Don't overdo it, just a few pieces of jewelry. make them coordinate with the outfit.  If you are allowed to and like wearing makeup go easy on it. Put on some mascara and lipgloss for a very light look if you want to you can put on a little it of eyeliner (don't look like a raccoon) and some foundation or powder. A tip if eyeliner makes your eyes look small, don't use the eyeliner on the inner corner of the eye. Starting on the outside corner, draw a line only 2/3 of the way towards the other side. When you completely surround your eye with eyeliner on both top and bottom, you close it up and it looks smaller. , Act confident. Be nice and say hi to everyone and do your best. So many opportunities are lost when you are shy.  

purchase your school supplies.  prepare your clothes.  prepare your lunch.  wake up with plenty of time to get ready.  have food.  clean yourself.  brush your teeth.  comb your hair and style it.  finally, comes the task of getting dressed.  wear makeup if you want to.  look in the mirror to make sure your hair and clothes are fine.  ,  be confident. 

 Being early will give you an advantage over some of the other interviewees, as it allows you extra time to meet the interviewers, take in the surrounds and settle yourself. Of course, others in the group may well do the same thing, so introduce yourself (see next).  Be polite and exchange a brief chat to show that you're friendly and team-spirited.   Be aware that you will probably be wanting some space to compose yourself, and so will your fellow interviewees, so don't chew their ears off. If another interviewee is too talkative, invasive or even trying to psych you out, be firmly polite and explain that you need a few minutes to yourself before the interview starts and simply move to another part of the room.  Usually group interviews are designed to see how you interact with other people so be courteous to your fellow interviewees.  These interviews are interactive. Pay attention, as you will be expected to participate and any lack of participation or enthusiasm will be noted.  The interviewers will usually give an overview as well as detailed instructions. Some group interviews involve training and exercises involving several steps. For example, you may have to perform a mock sales pitch using the companies steps to a successful sale.  Interviewers may be looking for leadership skills, but this does not mean talking over others or trying to be the loudest. Instead, act as a 'facilitator': say "Shall we take a vote?" and then count the votes. This shows that you are confident, but willing to listen to others.  Again, if trying to show leadership, delegate tasks to others. Don't try to do it all yourself: no good leader would do that, but if you can co-ordinate others, this works well.Take detailed notes if you are allowed to do so.  Direct your pitch at everyone, and don't focus all your attention on one person.  If someone hasn't said much, ask their opinion. This is great as it shows you are considerate and a real team player. (But don't defer to someone else when it's your chance to speak.)  , This is a good way to seem friendly and a little authoritative at the same time.  Speak out, but don't cut other people off or go over your allotted time for the question or exercise. If you are broken up into small groups, realize that people will still come over from time to time to hear what you are saying.  It might be nerve-wracking but if you appear morose you shan't fare well.  Send a follow-up letter that thanks them for the opportunity and their time.  

arrive early.  introduce yourself to the people from the company before the group interview begins.  stay polite towards your fellow interviewees throughout the interview.  be alert and ready for anything.  listen.  be considerate.  give others a turn.  make eye contact with everyone at some point.  include quieter people.  praise others for their good ideas.  don't be shy.  smile.  be sure to say goodbye to the interviewers before you leave. 

 Although it can be difficult, it can help to find a supportive person in your life who will be a good listener, like your parents, a favorite teacher, or other loved ones. When young people are hurting because of their relationships with their peers, they should confide in supportive adults.Talk about how you feel when you are excluded. Feeling like you are heard and understood can help make you feel better.Talking to an adult will also let you know that you are not alone.; , Often when a person is a social outcast in one place, like in school, that person will be accepted in other places, like on a sports team.Putting yourself in multiple settings will increase your chances of making friends.   Doing multiple extracurricular activities that you like will give you more opportunities to make friends. It may even be easier to make friends through extracurricular activities because you will find other kids who share your interests. Focus on your interests.Join a sports team, sign up for a theater troupe, take an art class, go to summer camp, or find another activity that you are genuinely interested in. Then focus on having fun and fostering your interests instead of just on making friends.Raise your self-esteem. Through participating in extracurricular activities that you like, you will gain a sense of passion and purpose. Doing something you like and that you eventually become good at will raise your self-esteem. People with self-esteem are attractive to others, so learning to value yourself will help you to make friends.Consider finding friends online. Seeking out people your age who share your interests is easier today than ever before. Look for web pages and clubs devoted to your interests. Just be sure to use the internet responsibly and with parental supervision.  Focus on making just one new friend to start. Having just one close friend has been shown to strengthen children's connectedness to school and to boost their self esteem.The quality of friendships is more important than the quantity of friends someone has. One good friend is better than having ten acquaintances.   Once you meet someone you'd like to be friends with, start a conversation with him/her.Ask the person questions about him/herself or his/her interests, or chat about the activity you are both engaged in. After you've spoken to the potential friend enough that you are friendly acquaintances, invite the person to do something with you. This can be scary at first, but that is the only way to turn an acquaintance into a friend.Get the person's contact information so that you can follow up with plans after you've invited the person to hang out.Accept invitations that you get from potential friends.Keep making plans and hanging out to let the friendship blossom., Relationships change constantly during the course of a person's life.If a friendship ends, especially during your childhood or teenage years, it's a sad but inevitable part of life. It is not a failure. Accept that some friends will leave your life, but that creates an opening for you to make new friends., Although it is normal for friendships to end, the way you end a friendship matters. The way you act toward people who are not your friends but who ostracize you also matters. Be the more mature person.Follow this mantra: create distance with dignity. No matter what your former friends are doing, or how cold or exclusive they become, avoid angry exchanges.Do not badmouth your former friends to others or online.That will just make you look mean and may scare away potential new friends. In fact, do not to put much energy into the broken friendship or the people excluding you. Move on and shift your focus to all that is going right in your life, such as the new friendships and activities that help you feel good about yourself., Spending a lot of time on social media, constantly reading other people's updates and obsessing about all of the fun things people are doing without you can lead to unhealthy FOMO (fear of missing out).Realize that people make tend to embellish their lives when they post online. Your peers may not be as happy as they say they are. And even if they are, their happiness does not mean you cannot be happy also. Realize that virtual "likes" and "friends" are not the same thing as in-person friendships. You can be much happier with only a few good, real-life friends in your life than a person who has thousands of online followers. Disengage from unhealthy relationships on social media until you feel better.Don't look at your peers' social media accounts for a little while. Instead, use the time you would have spent online to try new activities, focus on your interests, and make new friends in real life. Be careful about what you post online.Whatever you post on the internet will be on there forever. Resist the urge to post unkind things about the people who are ostracizing you. Again, be the better person, and focus on your interests and potential new social groups than on the people who are excluding you.    The people excluding you may not realize that they are making you feel like a social outcast. Unless someone is actively mean to you, do not assume that he or she has malicious intentions toward you. Sometimes not getting invited to something is just an oversight. Maybe the person you think is excluding you actually thinks you are not interested in being friends with him/her. Unless that person is actively mean to you, consider being friendly to him/her. Maybe that person will become your friend. It gets better. Most social exclusion happens during adolescence, and most cliques disappear by the end of high school. Life gets better, and you will not always be a social outcast. Stay positive, and know that you are not alone.  Do not let what is "popular" discourage you from following your passions and from being your wonderful, unique self.   True friends will respect your independence and unique personality.Definitely do not let your desire to have friends outweigh your knowledge of right and wrong. Do not do anything you are uncomfortable doing just to make people like you.Speak up when your friends are doing something wrong., People who enjoy true and lasting popularity are those who are good friends, whether they have one friend or one hundred friends.   Being a good friend means being respectful, fair, interested, trustworthy, honest, caring, and kind.So if you want to have friends, be just the kind of friend you'd like to have.Being a good friend will help you keep the friends you have and will attract new friends.  

confide in a loved one.  diversify your social options.cast a wide net in seeking friendships.  start small.  recognize that the end of a friendship is not failure.  remain dignified and polite.  resist obsessive fomo (fear of missing out) behavior online.  don't take everything personally.people are often so focused on their own problems and their own lives, especially during adolescence, that they aren't really focused on other people.  stay true to yourself.  be a good friend. 

 This is a great way to make queso and keep it warm for several hours at a time because you can serve it right from the slow cooker. This recipe makes about six cups. Here is what you will need:8 oz cream cheese 2 10-oz cans diced tomatoes with green chiles 1 Tbsp fresh cilantro, chopped 16 oz. Velveeta cheese or cheddar cheese 1 can of Chili beans or 1 lb. of ground beef (optional) A slow cooker or crock pot  , Empty one can of diced tomatoes and green chiles into the slow cooker. Do not drain the can of tomatoes and chiles. Then, add the cream cheese in the slow cooker.Cut the cream cheese into one inch cubes to help it melt evenly and to prevent it from burning.  Cook the diced tomatoes and cream cheese for approximately 15 minutes, or until the cream cheese completely melts.Do not cover the slow cooker. Stir the dip mixture occasionally as the cream cheese melts.  First, make sure you cut the cheese into small cubes. Add the cheese to the slow cooker one handful at a time to prevent burning, and stir well after each addition.Continue stirring the cheese in until all of it melts completely.  Pour in a little at a time, stirring until the mixture thickens to a dip consistency.The mixture is at a dip consistency when you can stick a chip into it.  If you chose to add chili beans, ground beef, or any other ingredient, do it at the end.The chili beans and ground beef need to be fully cooked before adding them in the queso dip. Feel free to add your own seasoning such as ground cumin, garlic, diced onion, or Worcestershire sauce to add more flavor.  Set the slow cooker on low and serve. Keep the slow cooker set on low up to four hours and serve the dip fresh.   The queso dip can be served with tortilla chips or vegetables. If your slow cooker has a warm setting, use that instead of the low setting.  

utilize your slow cooker for a rich chili-queso.  combine the cream cheese and half of the diced tomatoes.  turn the slow cooker on high.  stir in the velveeta.  add the remaining tomatoes and chiles.  add in the rest of your ingredients.  sprinkle with cilantro and serve warm. 

 In the Sims the key code is Ctrl+Shift+C). You will find Ctrl (The Control key; Command for Mac) is used a lot with another key to open up cheat boxes. While this method is tedious, you may discover the box on your own (Some cheat websites pay for cheat codes!). Now all you have to do it guess a code. Codes are either names of programmers or developers, or they can be a phrase that describes what they do (Ex. unlimited ammo). NOTE: Most cheat codes do not include spaces.; , Simply Google (Game Name) Cheats or something similar and you will get millions of hits. Browse around. Most of the results on the first page will probably be a link to a cheat code site.  Just Search for (Game Name) Walkthrough.  Sites also provide "Easter Eggs" (Special Hidden Objects, etc.) and where they can be found. You can find these sites in the sources below.  You can find some sites that provide trainers in the Sources below. Trainers usually only work with games that you install on your computer and not online games.  also have full walkthroughs of your game. Look at some of the sites in the Sources for more.  

try key combination out: usually cheat code boxes will appear after hitting a combination of two or more keys (ex.  use google: using google or any other search engine will return a wealth of information.  use youtube: youtube usually has lots of video walkthroughs of most every game.  use a cheat code site: there are many sites out there that can aid you in finding codes.  use a trainer: a trainer is a program that you run while running the game that gives you special features without the need for cheat codes.  read a walkthrough: a lot of cheat sites besides providing cheat codes, "easter eggs", etc. 

 Try to connect the drive to another computer. If it works, you know the issue is not in the drive. There are two kinds of drive failure: mechanical failure and logical failure.   Logical failure means that the physical components have not had any damage, and data recovery is cheaper and easier. Mechanical failure may include some broken parts, making it malfunction or fail completely. If you here click sounds coming from your drive, backup all data as soon as you can, and take the drive to a technician. Professionals handle drive issues best. If you are successful, you may find that the data has mixed up, and you will have some work to do in reorganizing it to its original format.  

if your hard drive crashed for any reason, do not panic, as all is not lost. 

 Seeking professional help can give you an important outlet for understanding why you’re crying in certain situations. A counselor might be able to help you figure out how to communicate more effectively so that you don’t end up crying so often. This person might also help you get to the root of why you feel like crying., Confide in someone you trust by talking about some of the issues that cause you to cry.

 Lay your shirt on a flat surface, such as a bed or table, with the front of the shirt facing the ceiling. Make sure the shirt is smooth and flat as well., Invert and fold up the bottom three to four inches (76 to 102 mm) of your shirt to make a cuff. At this point, the bottom section of your shirt should look like a sleeve that has been folded up., Fold either the right or left side inwards toward the middle of the shirt. It should line up with the middle of the shirt. Then fold the sleeve backward to make it line up with the shirt as well., Take the other side and fold it inwards and on top of the first side. In other words, make sure to overlap the first side with the second side. Also fold the sleeve backward so everything lines up.At this point, your shirt should look like a vertical rectangle.  Starting at the top, roll the shirt toward the bottom until it is fully rolled. Make sure to roll the shirt tightly. The tighter the roll, the more compact the shirt will be., Remember the cuff you formed in the beginning? Use this to tuck the shirt to form the burrito.

 Lay out 3 tortillas. Top the tortillas with the shredded cheese, sliced Roma tomatoes, and pepperonis. Put 3 more tortillas on top of the ingredients, forming a quesadilla.You can alter the ingredients to your liking. For example, you can choose to use beef instead of pepperoni.; , Get out a 12-inch (30.5 cm) non-stick skillet. Put the skillet over medium heat. Melt 1 tablespoon (14.2 g) of butter in the skillet. Rotate the skillet as the butter melts so that the butter coats the bottom of it., Place one quesadilla in the skillet on top of the butter. Cook it for 6 to 8 minutes. Turn it over once during the 6 to 8 minutes. The quesadilla will be lightly browned when it is complete., Repeat the preparation and cooking with the remaining ingredients. Place the finished quesadillas on a plate while the next one is cooking. You should have 16 servings once all of the ingredients have been used., Cut the quesadillas into square pieces. Or, you can choose to cut the quesadillas into triangles if you prefer. Serve warm with warmed pizza sauce. 

top the tortillas with ingredients.  melt the butter.  cook the quesadillas in a skillet.  repeat the process.  cut into squares. 

 Most developers prefer to use rustup to install Rust as it is the easiest method of doing so. With it, people using Unix will be able to install Rust using just one command, while Windows users simply have to run an executable file.  For people running Unix or Linux, run curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh to download and run the installer. Once downloaded, the installation will begin immediately. For people running Windows or another platform, you can find the installer for your device on the official website.; , Once the installer has been run, you will be presented with three options: proceed with, customize or cancel the installation. The first option will go forward with the installation using all of the default options. If you choose to customize the installation, you will be presented with the following three questions.  What is your default host triple? What default toolchain should be used? Here, you can choose between stable, beta and nightly. Should the PATH variable be modified? If you choose yes, Rust will be added to the PATH automatically, thus eliminating the need to do so yourself. By pressing enter, you can skip a question and leave it with its default value.  After the installation is finished, you will be presented with the message "Rust is installed now. Great!". This will tell you if the installation was successful., To test to see if your Rust installation was successful, open your terminal and type rustc -V. This command should print out the version of rustc you are using. If you get an error stating that the command was not found, you may need to add the Cargo bin directory to the PATH manually. This folder should be located at ~/.cargo/bin on Linux systems., As a final test, attempt to create a new Rust project using Rusts package manager, Cargo. To do this, run cargo new --bin in your terminal. If all goes well, you should have a new directory with the specified name containing a configuration file and a directory titled "src", proving everything is working as it should. 

retrieve 'rustup-init'.  select your installation type.  wait for the installation to complete.  test your rust installation.  try creating a project using cargo. 

 Fungi have a nasty habit of sticking around in our bodies long after they show up on our skin. Continue your chosen method(s) of treatment for 3-6 weeks total, even after all external signs of athlete's foot have disappeared. This will make sure that the fungus has truly left your system, and making a second round of the skin ailment much less likely.  But not too much. The amount of exposure your feet require takes walking a thin line; too much, and you might contract the fungus again. Too little exposure, and moisture build up will, again, cause a second bout of athlete's foot. Try to wear sandals and shoes that allow your feet to breathe, but avoid walking barefoot. When you are walking in moist areas (such as at a pool or in the shower), wear flip-flops or other shoes that protect your feet from contacting the fungi-filled floors.  Any shoes you wore during the period of time you suffered from athlete's foot are inevitably contaminated with the fungi. Purchase an antifungal powder that focuses on this particular problem, and sprinkle it in all your shoes on a weekly basis., Fungi grow best in moist areas, making sweaty feet a prime environment. Keep your feet dry at all times, using a towel to absorb excess moisture between your toes and on the soles of your feet after showering, sweating heavily, or swimming. Doing this on a regular basis will produce an environment inhospitable to the fungi that cause athlete's foot.  Heavy socks that trap moisture are a no-go if you are a sufferer of athlete's foot. Make the transition to wearing only cotton socks that allow your feet to breath and are easily washed and bleached. Additionally, wash socks on a regular basis, and wear each pair for a single use only.  You’ve cleaned your shoes, cleaned your socks, and the one place left accountable for possible fungus growth is your shower. Clean the floor of your shower with a wash-down of bleach on a weekly basis. Any sponges or brushes that you may use to clean your feet in the shower should be thrown out and replaced or properly disinfected.  Anything that might contain foot related fungi or sweat should be avoided, unless its your own. Keep your own towels, shoes, and socks to yourself and avoid borrowing those items from others. 

continue treatment.  let your feet breathe.  disinfect your shoes.  keep your feet dry.  wear cotton socks.  bleach your shower.  avoid sharing.

 It's important to build your vocabulary if you want to study Spanish for school. Use a Spanish-English dictionary at home or Spanishdict.com online. Avoid Google translate, which may not give you the best answers. The more words you look up, the more Spanish you'll know.; , If you want to do well in class and on tests, then it's important to do your homework every night, no matter how busy you are.  They will understand that you are only learning. Remember to tell them you're learning so they can slow down.  Check the Internet for games and videos that can also help you learn Spanish while making learning more fun.  Avoid your phone, your classmates, or any other distractions and make sure you are focused on your teacher.  If you're in an immersion class and you don't know what your teacher is saying, then you can say, "Lo siento, Señor/Señora, pero no comprendo," ("I'm sorry, Mr./Mrs., but I don't understand") to show that you don't understand what's going on. Before you ask, though, look at your teacher's actions to try to get some context for what's going on.  Look over your notes from class to refresh your memory.  Go over the vocabulary for the class, focusing on the words you can't remember or don't know. Writing them down with the definition and translation helps. Whenever you get nervous, review the paper. Feel free to review the paper before the test.  If your teacher allows it, asking what a word or instructions mean can help you do better on the test.  

look up any words you don't know.  do your homework.  speak to someone whose first language is spanish.  use online games and videos.  always listen to the teacher.  ask for clarification.  review your notes.  review relevant vocabulary.  if you don't understand a word or instructions during a test, try asking for help. 

 The game will proceed clockwise (or counterclockwise, if you prefer) around the circle from the person who is going first. It does not matter whether you go clockwise or counterclockwise as long as you all agree on the direction.  Pass out the cards one at a time. Whoever drew the highest card is the first dealer. If you are going clockwise, start by giving the card at the top of the deck to the person to your left. Continue around the circle in this manner until each person has one face-down card. Then, keep dealing around the circle in the same pattern until everyone has the right amount of cards.   Deal the cards face-down so that each player knows which cards he or she has. If you accidentally reveal a card, slide it back into the dealing pile at random. If you are the dealer, you still get cards! Don't leave yourself out. Again: you don't have to deal exactly seven cards to each person as long as everyone has the same amount of cards. Some people play a variation in which the dealer can arbitrarily choose how many—or how few—cards to deal at the beginning of each round.  Once you deal, you should have an extra stack of cards left. Place these cards face-down in the middle of the floor or table where you're playing. Everyone in the game should be able to easily reach this stack.   Designate a space next to these cards for the Discard pile. This is where you'll put the cards that get knocked out of play. 

sit in a circle.  deal each player seven cards without looking at them.  stack the leftover cards in the center. 

 Pour 3 to 4 cups of canola oil into a wok or deep-fryer. You may need more or less oil, depending on the size of your wok or deep-fryer. Just ensure that you have about 3 inches of oil in the bottom of the fryer. Heat the oil between 360 and 375 degrees F (182 to 190 C).If you don't have a wok or deep-fryer, you can use a wide saucepan to fry the sweet potato chips. You may want to attach a deep-fry thermometer to the fryer so you can check the temperature as you fry.; , Scrub one pound of sweet potatoes under cold water and peel them. Take a sharp knife and cut the sweet potatoes into slices that are as thin as paper. It may be easier to use a mandolin and slice them on the thinnest setting. A mandolin will give you more uniform chips.You may want to use organic sweet potatoes since you'll be leaving the skins on the potatoes. Studies on pesticides in potatoes found that pesticides are concentrated in the peel.  Carefully place a single handful of the sweet potato chips into the hot oil. They should fry quickly and begin to turn brown and curly. Avoid letting the sweet potatoes fry for more than one minute.Avoid frying more than a handful of sweet potatoes at a time. If you add more, the temperature of the oil will drop quickly, so they won't fry properly.  Use a deep-fry skimmer to scoop out the fried sweet potato chips. Set the cooked chips on a rack that is lined with paper towels and sprinkle them with salt to taste. Continue to fry the rest of the sweet potato chips in batches.When frying more sweet potato chips, ensure that the oil gets back up between 360 and 375 degrees before adding another handful of chips.  

heat canola oil.  wash and slice the sweet potatoes.  fry the sweet potatoes in batches.  remove the sweet potato chips. 

 Rinse your hands for 10 seconds.Before applying the medication, it's always a good idea to perform this step. You don’t want bacteria on your parrot’s eye because it can worsen its vision.; , It can be difficult to open the bottle when holding your parrot. You want this to be fast as possible, so your bird won’t be irritated.  Your parrot may be moving around when applying the treatment, so having someone around is helpful., The reason why not to cover the parrot and pick it up from the perch is because your parrot will grip the perch with its nails which can harm it. The parrot will resist.  Ensure your parrot’s head is out of the towel.   Your parrot will escape if it knows you are approaching with a towel because it is intrusive, so try to do this silently.  You should be holding the parrot like you are holding a taco.   The towel on the bird should be snug, holding its wings. Don't place your hand on its chest.  You want to make sure the area is clean.   If discharge is present, clean eye with sterile eye wash solution. Place tissue aside and dispose later because you don't want to deal with reinfection.  However, birds will typically bite on the towel, so for some birds you don't need to hold chin. This ensures that the medication will be applied precisely in the eye.  Don't touch the tip of the bottle or the birds eye to minimize contamination and blinking. Allow ten seconds for the drop to disperse in the parrot’s eye.   If your parrot continues to blink, you can apply a drop in the nostril and some will travel to the eye.  You should follow your vets instructions. If you aren't sure, the frequency is printed on the side of the prescription.   Some eye drops for specific infections or swelling need to be applied every two hours, once a day, or twice a day. In that case, it's imperative to check the label on the prescription.  Your parrot will gain a positive experience and would be easier to apply eye drops when needed.  Ensure the parrot's water bowl is full because it was probably struggling to escape when applying the medication.  Reseal medication to ensure its effectiveness.  

wash your hands with anti-bacterial soap for 20 seconds.  have the medication ready.  ask for some assistance if someone is around.  place your parrot on the ground.  cover your parrot from its neck to its tail from behind swiftly.  gently grab it from the belly and flip it over on its back.  clean around your parrot’s eye with a tissue or cotton ball before applying the medication.  gently hold the parrot’s chin upward with the non-dominant hand when applying the medication if it doesn't bite.  position the eye drop 1 cm from the cornea and apply a drop of the medication into the parrot’s eye.  repeat the process if you need to.  give your parrot a treat.  return the parrot to its perch when finished.  close all medications and place them somewhere secure. 

 Even if you are not a skilled welder, it is possible to adhere a nut to the stripped screw head. Purchase a super strong welding adhesive. Find a nut that is the same diameter as the screw head., Place the nut on the screw head, making sure it is centered. Carefully fill the nut with the super strong welding adhesive. Allow the product to dry the recommended amount of time., Make sure the nut has completely adhered to the screw. Grab a socket wrench and place it on the nut. Rotate the socket wrench and remove the stripped screw from the surface. 

gather the supplies.  adhere the nut to the head.  remove the screw. 

 A hamster's teeth and nails do not stop growing. This is why hamsters need chews and sand to keep their teeth and nails filed down. Occasionally, you may need to have your hamster's teeth or nails trimmed if they become overgrown. Unless you're professionally trained, it's best to take your hamster into the vet when he needs a trim. You want to make sure the procedure is done safely and your hamster is not hurt in the process., Hamsters are not always friendly to new pets. If you're going to introduce a second hamster, do so when your current hamster is still young. Also, do not place a male and female in the same cage unless you want them to breed. Hamsters are very fertile and a female can give birth to 3 to 18 babies every 30 days.If you do add a new hamster, you should spend several days introducing them. Keep your hamsters in separate cages where they can see each other for a few days. When you do place them in the same cage, keep an eye on them to make sure there's no fighting. You might want to wear protective gloves during the introduction. In the event of a fight, you may have to separate the hamsters., As stated, a wheel is an essential part of your hamster's health. However, you want to make sure your hamster's wheel is big enough for safe use. Small wheels can cause back problems from your hamster bending his back to fit the wheel. If you have a larger hamster, go for a bigger sized wheel.At minimum, look for a wheel of at least 6.5 inches. Certain types of hamster, like Syrian hamsters, tend to grow very big. In this case, you should get a wheel that's at lest 8 inches., You should never let your hamster out of his cage unsupervised. If you use a hamster ball or similar device, only allow your hamster to roam in it when you're watching. Accidents and mishaps can occur, resulting in injury and even death. Your hamster should never be allow to roam the house without supervision. 

trim teeth and nails regularly.  take precautions when introducing a new hamster.  get the right wheel.  supervise your hamster when you let him out of his cage.

 Reminding yourself what you have to be grateful for and recording your gratefulness each day helps to cement how thankful you are. It doesn't matter how difficult your life is at the moment, there is always something to be thankful for, some shining light of gratitude. Finding that will help you deal with the other parts of life.Record 3-5 things you're thankful for every single day. These can be things as simple as "the sun was shining" or they can be as big as "my significant other proposed." Spend a little time each day reflecting on the things you're most grateful for, during that day. You may even find that you have more than 5 things you want to record. When you're having a particularly difficult time, it can be beneficial to go back to what you've written previously. If it's a really hard time, find the smallest things that you can be grateful for. For example: if you have a terminal illness it's unlikely you're going to be able to be grateful for that, but you can be grateful for things like, someone else bringing you dinner, a warm bed, your cat snuggling with you. All these little things can make the trauma of the big thing (the illness) more bearable.; , People who are thankful for the things in their lives aren't living an easier life than you. In fact, many of the people who practicing the most gratitude are the people who have had incredibly difficult things happen to them because they understand that it isn't the situation that's the problem, it's how you think about the situation that makes it easier or more difficult.   Use the right words. Using negative language and labeling can make a situation more difficult and make it harder for you to be thankful in general. For example: labeling it "my horrible illness" is going to make it worse than simply saying "the illness that I have." In the second instance not only are you not making the illness part of you, but you are also turning it into neutral language, rather than negative. Bashing yourself and others is going to make you less able to be truly thankful. When you find that you're thinking negatively about yourself or another person, stop and turn that thinking around. For example you think "I am so stupid when it comes to math." Instead, say "I am having some difficulty with this math problem." This re-frames the problem so that the problem isn't you, it's that there is a disconnect between you and this problem and that is something that you can overcome.  By being in the moment you are making it impossible for your brain to race ahead and worry or plan for the future, or become bogged down in the past. This is one way of practicing thankfulness because you are immersing yourself in the present and acknowledging and thanking the importance of the "now."   Practice mindfulness while you eat. This means, don't read a book, watch t.v. or check your phone. Instead, focus on the food that you're putting into your mouth: is it hot? cold? what is the texture like? the smell? is it sweet or sour or salty? Do this while going for a walk, or simply sitting outside. Notice the color of the sky and shape of the clouds. Notice the color and shape of the trees and the plants. Use your nose to locate any smells, and listen to the wind in the trees, the sound of children playing, the sound of cars as they go past you. Practicing mindfulness is a way of being present to each moment as it happens. It is one technique that can help ease mental health issues like depression or anxiety, because these tend to be caused by fear for the future and concern about the past., Meditation is another of those incredibly useful ways of dealing with mental health issues and a general sense of malaise in your life. It can also help to foster your thankfulness and gratitude practices.   Go somewhere quiet and meditate for 15 minutes each day. Seat yourself comfortably and start to take deep breaths. Your belly will rise and fall with each inhales and exhale. Focus on your breath. When errant thoughts demand your attention acknowledge them and let them go. If you find that you've strayed from the meditation, focus on your breathing again. It can be helpful to set a breathing limit rather than a time limit so you aren't constantly watching the clock. Say something like "I'll meditate for 50 breaths." If you lose track, that's okay! It's probably time to be done, anyway.  Being thankful is actually something that can greatly help make you healthy and keep you healthy. However, it does help to give thankfulness a boost by cultivating a healthy lifestyle for yourself by getting enough sleep, drinking water, and eating in a way that fosters your well-being.   Sleep is a huge component to health and to being thankful. While, it's certainly admirable to practice gratitude even during those sleepless, anxiety-fueled times in your life, getting enough sleep can help make thankfulness easier to cultivate. Try to get to sleep before 11:00 p.m. and turn off all electronics (computer, phone, iPod) 30 minutes before bedtime. Get enough water. Since water makes up so much of our systems, it's a necessary component to making sure everything runs smoothly. Try for at least 8 glasses of water each day. Get exercise. Exercise (especially things like cardio) releases happy chemicals like endorphins, which help to regulate your moods and make you feel better. Try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise each day. This can be something as simple as going for a run, or putting on some music and dancing for 30 minutes, or doing some yoga. Make sure you're putting food in your body that will help your body run effectively and happily. Go for veggies and fruits (the darker colored, the more nutrients) like kale, red peppers, and bananas; good carbohydrates like brown rice, whole grain, oats; protein like salmon, nuts, lean meats, eggs. Avoid sugar and salt as much as possible. Focus your diet on the best, most healthy parts, with the occasional indulgence.  Sometimes a good way to get you back on track and feeling better is to take a break. You'll need to create things to be grateful for, sometimes, and a break can be a good one.   At work (or school, etc.), go for a walk around your building or step outside for 15 minutes to breathe the fresh air. Spend this time musing on how thankful you are for the opportunity to take a break, to stretch your legs, to feel the sun. Sometimes you just really need a vacation. If you have the ability to take one, you should! A vacation and taking a break from your usual activities can give you a greater appreciation for them, as well as recharge you to deal with the things that you're less appreciative of.  So often life gets busy and you forget to tell people that they matter, that you've noticed what they do and it means a lot to you. People will remember you more fondly if you thank them. It will cultivate an atmosphere of thankfulness that can spread out gradually.   Talk about gratitude with family. Set aside a time, like the evening meal, to talk about the things you were grateful for that day. Let each family member have a few minutes just to discuss what made them thankful.Send a thank you note. it is really amazing what sending just a small thank you note can do. A thank you note acknowledges that they gave you something (time, effort, a gift) that they didn't have to and that you appreciate what they've done. You don't have to write a massive novel thanking them, just a few lines that let them know what they and their gift (a thing, of time, of energy, etc.) meant to you.  Being thankful isn't just about telling people you are thankful, it's also about giving back to your community and to your friends. This doesn't mean that you give back so that everything is even and no one "owes" anyone anything. That isn't how gratitude and thankfulness work.Do something for the people in your life who have helped you. You don't have to tell them that you're doings something for them because they've done something for you. That comes across as self-serving. Instead, when they need an extra hand, you provide it. For example: helping your sister's family clean their house during a really busy season, taking your grandmother to her doctor's appointments, or giving your friend a hand moving into her new place. Do something for people you don't know. Sometimes people do things for you that you can't easily repay (in the sense that you want to thank them and show how much it meant to you). Of course you should thank them, tell them how important their action or gift was. But you can also pay the kindness forward. For example: your professor helps you out in ways that you can never repay (writing letters of recommendation, being a mentor, reading your work), so you instead pay that forward and mentor someone else.  When someone does something nice for you--gives you a gift, brings you a hot meal, offers to read over and edit your thesis--focus on how someone tried to bring something good into your life. Someone gave up their precious time, or money, etc. to do something for you.This focus cultivates an atmosphere of gratitude that is then passed on to other people through your actions and words, especially if you have children., Speaking the words aloud can help cement the feeling of gratitude in your life. Not only that, but it helps others to know that you are thankful for the things that they have done for you. It can, also, help get you back on track when you're starting to feel put-upon by the world, or anxious.   Use the words "thank you" as a sort of prayer or mantra. You can thank specific things, or you can just repeat the words over and over to yourself. For example: if you're on the bus to work, you could start quietly (or in your head) thanking the food that you ate that morning, the rain for watering all the trees, the bus for carrying you promptly to your destination, your rain jacket for keeping the rain off. You should also remember to thank the people you see throughout the day. Thank the barista who makes your coffee, thank the person who held the door for you, thank the customer service person who helped you figure out why your phone wasn't working. Thanking people fosters an atmosphere of gratitude that will extend throughout other people's days, as well. Remember, that it is impossible to be in a state of fear and appreciation. By cultivating gratitude (speaking it aloud) you can do things like ease anger, anxiety (even chronic anxiety), depression, and other health problems.  Sometimes it can be really hard to be thankful in your life. Things like having a significant other break up with you, or make you angry, or when you really dislike your job. These are the times, however, when it is even more important to cultivate gratitude, because that will help you get through the hard times better than getting angry or upset will.   To cultivate gratitude for something like a difficult or boring job, make a list of the good things about the job: it gives you money so you can buy food and have a roof over your head, it gives you a chance to take the bus into the city and see the early morning sun, you brought a delicious sandwich for lunch that day. You may have to start really small to find the things to be thankful for, but it will put you in a better mood and when you're starting to get down or depressed about it, pull out that list and start adding to it. For something like a relationship break-up, you should definitely allow yourself time to grieve and be sad (being grateful doesn't mean doing away with emotions like sadness, anger, etc. it simply means making them more manageable). After you've given yourself time to grieve, make a list of the things that you learned or are grateful for from the relationship (you learned you don't want to be a morning person, you learned how to compromise, etc.) and then what you are thankful for about the relationship being over (now you can leave your stuff wherever you want, now you can eat blueberries because your ex was allergic, etc.). Basically, you can apply your thankfulness technique to any situation. There is always something to be thankful for, even if it's a very small thing (the sun is shining, etc.). Finding those things and acknowledging them can help you to lead a more fulfilled and content life.  

keep a gratitude journal.  turn your thinking around.  practice mindfulness.  practice meditation.  cultivate a healthy lifestyle.  take a break.  tell someone you appreciate them.  give back.  focus on intention.  just say thank you.  find the thankfulness in specific events. 

 You can raise your voice, but avoid yelling at your children. You will find that you are becoming more upset than they are. Instead, use a stern but level tone that indicates you are not pleased. This will demonstrate that you are in control.If you are upset, angry, or unable to keep calm, do not discipline your child yet. Find a quiet, safe room where you can become level-headed first. With very young children, however, you may need to discipline them immediately.  Effective discipline shows children that their actions have consequences. This will prepare them for the difficult choices they may have to make later in life. There are two types of consequence-based punishment. These are:    Logical Consequences: When your children break a rule, you create a consequence by punishing them.This is effective on young children under the age of five who might not yet realize the effect of their actions.For example, if your toddler throws a tantrum, put them in time-out.  Natural consequences: In non-dangerous situations, you let your children make a mistake and learn from the consequences that occur as a result.You can start doing this when your child is a toddler up through their teens. For example, if an older child does not do their homework, do not help them with it. Instead, let them get in trouble at school. After school, discuss with them the effect of their actions, and let them know that you expect better from them in the future., If your children consistently break the rules, you should take away something they enjoy for a brief period of time. Do this immediately after they break the rule.Only take away the privilege for a certain period of time. When you return it, make it clear that if they do not behave, it will be taken again.   For younger children, you might threaten to take away a bedtime story or morning cartoons. Older children might respond better if you temporarily take away a video game console or TV time. If you have a teenager, you might want to take away their phone, chargers, or internet access for non-school related matters.Never take away something the child needs. For example, do not take away meals.While you might sometimes put your child in time-outs during special events, make sure that your child can still socialize, even when they misbehave. Childhood is an important time to learn social skills.  Set a certain area in your house to be the official “time out” spot. Warn your children that they will be put there if they do not follow the rules. When they do get sent there, set a time limit. One minute per year of age is a good measure. Do not let them leave before the time is up., For teenagers, being grounded is the social equivalent of time out. You have taken away their ability to go out with friends. This can be effective to discipline your teenager if done correctly. Set a reasonable time period that they will be grounded for. They should not be grounded for more than a few days.If your teenager has a birthday party or a dance coming up, warn them that their bad behavior may prevent them from going.If they want to go, they will have to make it up to you, either by taking on more chores or writing an apologetic letter to you. Do not strip away all of their privileges at once. You may find your teenager is acting out more because they have nothing left to lose. 

use a calm, firm voice.  show them the consequences of their actions.  take away toys and privileges.  put younger children in time out.  ground teenagers. 

 The super strength and industrial strength relaxers are traditionally used on African American hair because it is so resistant to straightening. Nothing wrong with that. Just don't use it every time. Alternate between the mild and strong relaxers (of the same brand) so your hair gets some rest between uses of the strong stuff. If you relax every 6 to 12 weeks, ask your beautician to use the super strength on every 3rd or 4th visit. Your hair will have grown out enough to avoid overlapping the super strength relaxer and the milder one will allow your hair to remain relaxed yet still strong. Also apply basing cream to the ends of your hair. This will prevent the ends from over processing due to relaxer runoff.; , By tradition many African Americans use conditioner often. As a result they have healthy thick hair. Condition is a good friend. Conditioner strengthens hair. Condition the length and ends of your hair daily or at minimum every other day. Do not put water on your scalp daily either, just the ends. Simply wet your ends about 2 inches (5.1 cm) from your scalp to the ends of your hair. Apply the conditioner according to the instructions. Your hair will love you for it. Conditioning your ends will keep them thick full and rich and they will not break easily.  After conditioning your ends, you will need to moisturize them. Find an excellent moisturizer (Ultra Black Hair is one of the best) and apply it to the ends while your hair is still wet. Again, do not apply moisturizer to your hair full strength. Place a small amount in a container or the palm of your hands and add water to dilute it. Be sure the water and moisturizer are well blended then apply to the ends of your hair only (from about 4 inches (10.2 cm) below your scalp to the ends of your hair. Dry hair is brittle: keep it moisturized for flexibility and less breakage.  Blow dryers are called blow fryers by The Long Hair Community for good reason. The intense heat of these machines is very damaging to African American hair types. Never blow dry your hair. Simply allow your hair to air dry. Heat damaged hair is extremely weak and breaks easily. To have strong hair, you must avoid using a blow dryer.  

don't use the strongest relaxer every time you get your hair relaxed.  condition your ends.  apply moisturizer.  avoid using a blow dryer. 

 Because charter schools are funded by the states they operate in, each state must pass legislation to determine the legality of opening and operating a charter school there. If you're interested in starting a charter school, you will first need to determine whether charter schools are permitted in your state. As of January 2016, the majority of states and the District of Columbia have passed laws that allow charter schools to operate. The states in the U.S. that do not currently permit charter schools include:   Kentucky Montana Nebraska North Dakota South Dakota Vermont West Virginia Washington - though charter schools were initially approved by state legislation, the state Supreme Court ruled in late 2015 that charter schools are unconstitutional.; , Of the states that do permit charter schools, approximately half put caps on how many charter schools can operate within that state. Depending on where you live, you may be ineligible to open a charter school due to capacity limits, even if charter schools are generally allowed in your state.The states which currently do not have caps in place are Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wyoming. If you live in a state that is not listed, there may be limitations on how many charter schools may legally operate within the state. However, it is still possible that your state may not have reached its capacity. Search online for charter school laws in your state to see if you can start a charter school in your region.  In addition to setting limits on the number of charter schools permitted, some states have laws that set limits on the types of charter schools allowed. That means that there may be restrictions on new start-up schools, public school conversions, and/or virtual schools.There are currently 31 states and Washington, DC, that allow for a variety of public charter school types. Those states are: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.  Starting a charter school is no easy task. It will take a lot of time and energy, and it will almost certainly be frustrating at times. Before you actually begin the process of starting a charter school, you should decide whether or not you'll be able to stick with the project, attend meetings, and work with other people to bring your vision to life.You'll probably need to put together a big team to actually make your charter school happen. Think about the set of skills you'll need to pull everything together: real estate experience, financial expertise, operations/management skills, leadership abilities, and educational instructors. Are you willing and able to work with such a large, diverse group of people? Planning for your charter school will most likely take at least a year, and may take considerably longer. You'll also need time to build a new facility or modify an existing one, depending on where you decide to open your charter school. Will you still have the same passion and patience for this project in a year (or longer)?  , The main reason for starting a charter school should ultimately be to provide your community with an educational opportunity that does not currently exist. Think about what aspects of a well-rounded education are missing from your children's current public school options, and think about ways to incorporate those points into your potential charter school.Think about what could realistically be taught in public school curriculum, but isn't. You will have to stick to your state's standards of education, of course, but what could be done differently while still adhering to those standards? One successful charter school concept in an area with a large population of Chinese families was to incorporate Mandarin Chinese language lessons into the curriculum.Can you think of similar ways to provide relevant academic opportunities for the students in your community?  , Once you have a clear idea of your charter school's concept, start working on drafting a mission statement. You'll need to be able to outline your vision to your state's Department of Education (or equivalent), so work on creating a clear, pragmatic mission and purpose.Your mission statement should be clear and concise. You'll need to relate most of your school's administrative decisions to its mission and core values, so the clearer and more specific you are, the easier it will be to put your mission into action.Ask yourself what the best, most ideal public school education would look like. Then start brainstorming a list of defining characteristics, and use these to generate the basic components of your mission statement.The mission statement should describe your charter school's purpose, as well as your goals/aspirations for the school (what you intend to accomplish). Consider explicitly incorporating a set of core beliefs into your mission statement. This can help guide you as you craft your mission statement, and may be useful for future evaluations of your school's performance.  Before you can actually start the paperwork to enact your idea for a charter school, you'll need a board of governance. You'll need to decide both who is on the board and how that board will function. This is a vital part of any successful charter school, as approximately 27% of all new charter schools were disrupted by internal conflicts within the board.The people you select for your board should understand the mission you've outlined, and they should be fully dedicated to that mission. Get to know the people you're considering for your board, and see if their values and beliefs align with yours (and your charter's). Most successful charter school boards have between 7 and 11 members, where each member significantly contributes some specific skill set to the board. Some important areas of expertise to try to incorporate in your board include finance/accounting, real estate, facilities management, legal services, human resource services, fundraising and marketing, community partnerships, and academic programming. Think about where your own weaknesses lie (and be honest with your self-assessment), then look for potential board members who can strengthen the board with their strengths and expertise. Consider splitting your team up into sub-committees who can work on assigned aspects of research and planning based on the members' areas of expertise.Don't forget that the role of the board is to govern your charter school, and not manage it. Governance involves creating goals for the school, setting metrics to measure the school's process, evaluate the school, approve the budget, create policies, engage in fundraising, and enforce local and state charter laws.  The budget will help determine how your money is spent within the charter school. The governing board members should have a considerable voice in determining the budget, both in terms of how to raise funds as well as how to use those funds.Keep your mission statement in mind as you develop your budget. Are you holding your future students' best interests in mind at all times? Work with an accountant or financial planner to develop a budget proposal for the first year of operation, as well as a long-range budget plan that will cover the first three to five years of operation. You'll also need a detailed cash-flow projection for every year of operation. Have your board review and approve the budget and projections you develop on an annual basis.  The facilities in which you build and operate your charter school could make or break your charter's chances of success. It's seldom as easy as finding a spot and signing the lease. Finding and securing a facility for a charter school often requires some degree of compromise and innovation.Try to search for potential facilities within a central location that will be convenient for your prospective students and their parents. Property that used to house a school may be an ideal location, but finding an old school building in good condition can be difficult. Some charters operate out of converted retail spaces, while others rely on multi-use facilities to share the space and resources with other schools or businesses. Don't put a downpayment on any property until you know that your charter application is accepted. But that doesn't mean don't think about it at all yet - in fact, having a potential place lined up might help strengthen your application.  In addition to a mission statement and board of governance, you'll need to develop a charter petition. This functions similarly to a business plan for a prospective business. It can span hundreds of pages and require extensive research.The charter petition should include your vision and mission for the school, as well as the school's curriculum design, hiring practices, predicted facilities/location, and communication structure. It can be very helpful to speak with other charter schools, both in your region and across the country. The board members at these established charter schools can help guide you with their own experience, and may be able to offer suggestions you would not have considered. Conduct your research in both legal requirements and functional practices of successful charter schools. You can find some of this information online, but for other aspects of research you may need to speak directly with board members at existing schools.  Because charter school laws vary so much from one state to another, it's important to know your state's specific guidelines, deadlines, and regulations. There is no single compendium, unfortunately, so you'll need to learn about the particular forms, applications, and their deadlines required in your state.   You can search online for your state's Department of Education website, or you can search for your state's charter school application process. Pay close attention to all relevant deadlines, as these will most likely be unique to charter schools in your state. Familiarize yourself and your board with all aspects of your state's charter school legislation. Some states require the applicants to exhibit a working knowledge of their state's legislated requirements, purpose, and objectives.  Depending on your state's guidelines and requirements, you may need to write and submit a letter of intent. Depending on where you live, you may need to submit your materials to your local school district, your state's Department of Education, or to your state's Charter School Office (if such an office exists in your state). The letter of intent should outline the planning and design you've worked on thus far, and should identify the board members you've chosen to establish and operate your proposed charter school.A successful charter school letter of intent should include, but may not be limited to:   applicant information founding group/board of directors, along with each individual's role and qualifications proposal history (if relevant) the name of your proposed charter school the prospective location - not the address, but simply the school district your charter will fall in, and any specific neighborhood(s) you've identified as a promising location planned grades and estimated enrollment any partner organizations you've lined up your school's mission statement an overview of how your school will live up to its mission statement the target population you hope your school will appeal to diversity initiatives for your charter school public outreach initiatives and community support for your proposed charter school  , Once your materials are submitted, you'll need to wait for authorization to proceed with your school. Most charter schools are authorized by the local school district, but if the school district denies your application you can appeal that decision to the county, and then to the state.Common reasons for a denied application include:   an unsound educational program a concern over the petitioners' inability to successfully implement the school program they've designed a failure to address the conditions or guidelines set out for charter schools in your town, county, or state a failure to meet the educational requirements of schools in your district, county, or state  , If your charter school is approved, you'll need teachers, administrators, and facility managers. You may want to consider alumni of alternative teaching programs like Teach for America, or turn to online job listings.Have teaching applicants teach a sample lesson as part of the interview process. This will give you a good look at how that applicant actually performs in the classroom. Follow up on all job references, and pay close attention to each candidate's job history. Look for any dismissals and find out why that applicant was terminated from his position. Do a basic online search to see if each individual has a public social media account. This may give you some insight into the applicant's personality and ethics. Work with local law enforcement to conduct a background check. Most new charter school startups have a high turnover rate. If a teacher you hire isn't working out, don't wait five years before finding a replacement. Similarly, don't feel hurt if your teachers don't stick around for more than a year or two. Anticipate turnover from both your employees and from you and your board as the employers.  Once you've been approved for operations and you've hired a strong faculty and staff, you're ready to open for enrollment. Remember that you may be bound to certain class size restrictions and other regulations, and always keep your charter school's mission statement at the forefront of all operations.  The only way to measure success is to monitor the progress (or lack thereof) of your school. Many education boards choose to work with an agency like Measures of Academic Progress (MAP).MAP can assess schools nationwide on a regular basis and provide you with a personalized assessment of your school's ranking, your students' progress, and your students' potential for growth. These results are often delivered within 24 hours, allowing you to keep on top of your your educators' effectiveness and your students' learning progress. 

check the legality of charter schools.  check for capacity limits.  determine if new schools are allowed.  assess your level of commitment.  come up with a concept.  write a mission statement.  establish your governance.  set a budget.  choose a location.  develop your petition.  visit your state's department of education website.  draft and submit a letter of intent.  wait for approval.  hire faculty and staff.  open for enrollment.  monitor progress at all levels. 

 Place a thick layer of paper towels and newspapers on the soiled area. Press or stand on the paper for a few minutes, allowing the liquid to be pulled out of the carpet.After you’ve soaked up as much urine as possible, leave the soiled papers in your dog’s bathroom area. For example, place the papers right outside in an area of your yard that your dog normally urinates. This will reinforce the expectation of their bathroom habits.; , Fill up a drinking glass with water. Pour a quarter of the water on the area at a time. Allow each pour of water to seep into the carpet before pouring more.  Evenly disperse the drops throughout the wet area.  Do not reuse any paper towels from earlier in the process. Doing so will replace the urine you’ve already removed from the area.  To create the mixture, mix 2 cups of warm water, 2 cups white vinegar, and four tablespoons of baking soda into a spray bottle or bowl and disperse on the wet area. Let it sit for five minutes., This will remove excess water from the fabric and prevent mold from forming underneath it. Blot the area until the area is only slightly damp.  Excess water from the process will be left either way, but using a vacuum or hair dryer to remove more water will speed up the drying process.  

soak up the urine.  pour small amounts of cool water on the soiled area.  add a few drops of dish detergent to the wet area.be sure to add the soap to the area in very small drops.  soak up the soapy water with fresh paper towels.  spray the area with a vinegar mixture if the odor persists.  blot the area with new paper towels.  dry the damp area using a vacuum cleaner. 

 Players roll dice and accumulate ‘wins’ (or "buncos".) The person with the most wins or Buncos at the end of the game is the winner., Each round correlates to a number on the die; the first round correlates with the one on the die, round two correlates with the two, etc. If a player rolls the dice and gets three of the number that the round correlates to, the person gets a bunco.    Example: If it is round four and the player rolls the dice and three of them land on four, that player gets a bunco.  Bunco is played with 12 people because it is divisible by four.If you are playing with more or less than 12 people, make sure that you are playing with enough people so that there are four players at each table. If you are playing with an odd amount of people, assign a “ghost” to someone. The partner of the “ghost” rolls and keeps score for the “ghost”. Essentially one person on the team with an uneven number gets to roll and keep score twice.  The head table controls the pace of the game. The game begins with the head table rings the bell. To pick the players who will be at the head table:   Collect all 12 score sheets. Assign someone to draw small stars on four of the card sheets. Shuffle the sheets. Have each player select a sheet. Those who pick sheets with stars are the players who will begin at the head table.  There should be four people at each table. A typical Bunco game consists of three tables--one “losing” table, one “middle” table and one head table. The head table is the best, the middle is middle, and the losing table is worst.  People across from each other are teammates. However, keep in mind that this will change every round.  This person will play the game, but will also be in charge of keeping track of points for the team he/she is on.  Each table should have a spiral notebook to write the score in, 3 dice, a score sheet for each player, and a pencil for each of the four people at the table. 

know the object of bunco.  know how to form a bunco.  find a group of 12 people to play with.  understand what the head table is.  divide the rest of the players between two tables.  divide each table into teams.  pick a scorekeeper for each team.  give each table what they'll need to play. 

 Seeing your friend’s name on your phone as you scroll through your numbers will only serve to remind you about her and about your falling-out. Delete her phone number from your contacts.   Clear your recent call and text history so that her number isn’t listed there either.  Delete your friend’s email address so that you’re not tempted to send a mean email or reminded about the hurt you feel.   If your email program keeps auto-loading her email address, try clearing the cookies on your web browser.  Unfriend this person on Facebook, stop following her on Twitter, and undo your connection to her on other social media sites. You might still see her if she’s friends with your friends, but at least you won’t be constantly reminded about her every time you log in.  If you have anything that belongs to your friend, return it to her. Otherwise, get rid of it. Remove this extra clutter from your life so that you don’t have these constant reminders about your former friend.  

delete your friend’s number from your phone contacts.  remove your friend’s email address from your address book.  remove your friend from your social media contacts.  return or get rid of your friend’s things. 

 Whatever your reason, be it for a relaxing walk to recover from a hard day or for reasons of discovery of your local wildlife, the best time is when you have at least a half hour free and the weather is favorable. It is safest and easiest to go nature walking when light. However, if you wish to walk at night and spot some night nature activity, be sure to choose a place that is safe and to carry sufficient lighting to see where you're headed.; , There are some commonsense basics to observe before taking a nature walk. Ensure that you're in good physical health before setting out on the walk. Take adequate water and maybe a snack, if needed. Wear supportive walking shoes that are suitable for the terrain and comfortable. Check the weather and take appropriate gear, such as a raincoat or layers of clothing, as required.  If possible, go somewhere that is close to your home and is not too much of a hassle to get to. However, you might wish to catch local transportation or take the car if you would like to go to a specific natural area. However, anywhere that has sufficient greenery is ideal, and indeed, it can be an excellent opportunity to discover what nature exists in your local urban environment just by being prepared to be observant of nature around you.   If possible, it's best if you can walk in an area with less commotion and more greenery. , Instead, focus on things around you (not the people). Look around to see the buildings, shops, pavement stones, vehicles, plants, trees, flowers, and so forth.  Notice small details about each one of these and admire them.  It is important that you do not think about yourself or any other person (relationships), or any past incidents or future issues. Just focus on the present and look around you.  Slowly take a walk and breathe in a relaxed manner. , You can continue to walk for an hour to get the optimum result, such as reducing your stress levels.  This nature walk will not only de-stress you but also help you to realize that the world is a big place and your problem is not as insurmountable or as huge as you thought before. This walk will also ensure that you relax and soothe your nerves and make you feel mentally better.  Whether it's just down your street or in a local park, there will be plenty to discover when you are focused on finding nature.  Even in the middle of the city you will find nature. Look down to find the plants that are pushing their way up through the pavement, look at eye level for street trees and butterflies and other flying insects. Find the gardens in your area, whether private, community run or publicly owned. Walk by them, and if allowed, through them. Look up to see which birds are soaring in the sky above you.   Notice how people bring greenery to the city. Notice how animals find niches in the city environment, including birds, insects, small and medium sized mammals and people's pets.  Use this knowledge to reattach yourself to the natural world and to help you distance yourself from the concrete, the technical and the hermetically sealed environments we create for ourselves. Realize that you can always discover nature while walking about and pass this wonder onto your friends, your children and your loved ones. Taking time to notice the ways in which nature has a way of reestablishing itself even in the most reshaped of environments is a way of helping you to remember that you are part of a much bigger and interconnected whole.  Seek to imagine what it would be like to be a part of the nature around you, such as being a tree or bush, a soaring bird or a furry animal. Stand in your desired location and breathe deeply and soak in the energy of the place and of the nature around you. Close your eyes and imagine you are a tree or a bush or something planted to the landscape. Or, imagine yourself as the animal you've chosen. Simply be for a time, seeking to think as that plant or animal might.  This can be especially good if doing a nature walk with the kids. Have them check off natural features on a simple chart, such as animals, tree types, plant elements, rock formations, and so forth. Some other ideas include:   Create a nature counting chart  Help children to appreciate nature; and  Make a nature journal upon your return from a nature walk. Keep in mind what you'd like to include in that journal as you walk about.  This can be a wonderful way to meditate, reflect, get exercise and feel at one with the world.  

choose the time to go on a nature walk.  be properly prepared for the walk.  choose where you'll go on a nature walk.  step out into your neighbourhood or local green space.  ,  do not think of your problem or your stress.  take a minute to focus on each of these or some of these which you find interesting or fascinating.  use what you're observing to help you move beyond what is stressing you.  continue in this fashion.  continue the stroll and look around for more things which you can focus on.  ,  after walking in this manner for about 30 minutes, notice that you will feel better.  reflect on your place in the world.  head out to your chosen spot.  look around you.  make mental notes of the ways in which local nature is thriving in your city.  aim to feel in touch with nature.  do nature activities as you walk.  try walking meditation.

 This way, Santa will be blessed by seeing a nice place and won't trip over anything.; , Before Santa Claus (aka Father Christmas) arrives, make sure you hang up your Christmas stockings over the fireplace or at the end of your bed, ready to be filled with fun sized gifts.  Sliding down millions of chimneys and delivering presents all over the world in one night can be very tiring. Santa Claus needs to keep his sugar levels up. Leave out a few cookies by the Christmas tree to give him that extra burst of energy he needs to make it round the rest of those homes on Christmas night.  It can be thirsty work too, so ask an adult to pour Santa a glass of milk and have it waiting for him. He'll be very grateful for this drink on a cold winter's night.  Of course, it's not just Santa who has work to do on Christmas Eve. In fact, the hardest part of the job is done for him by his magical reindeer. Leave them a few carrots to munch on. They'll provide Rudolph and the rest with some much needed energy as they fly around the globe, making sure the big man gets where he needs to be, when he needs to be there.  Whatever you do, you must make sure that you are tucked up in bed before Santa arrives. He will only visit your house once you are asleep. And don't think you can outsmart him by pretending. He can always spot a faker. The sooner you go to bed, the sooner it'll be Christmas.  If you've been good all year, on Christmas morning, you could wake up to find a mountain of presents under the Christmas tree. The cookies and the milk will be gone and so will the carrots.  

keep your home clean and neat all year, but, a few day before christmas, do an extra good job.  hang stockings.  set out the cookies.  provide a drink of milk.  leave a snack for the reindeer.  go to bed.  wake up. 

 Whether you like bold glasses or own 20 cats, it's the things that make you unique that make you memorable. Don't be afraid to show that side to the person you want to dream about you., That is, don't hide your opinion or thoughts. Being who you really are will help you stand out.For instance, if the person you are trying to get to notice you asks you what movie you like, don't just say, "Oh, you know, comedies." Be specific: "I really liked the latest Star Trek movie. I know a lot of Trekkies hated it, but I loved the story line."  , People like being told nice things about themselves, and you will increase your chances of being memorable if you do compliment someone., To stick in someone's mind, you need to stand out from the crowd. Therefore, you need to do things out of the norm. Wear a silly hat around the person. Bake a cake for him or her. Do something that makes him or her remember you in particular., One way to show you are interested in a person is to listen intently. You show you genuinely care about what the person thinks or says. Because this quality is rare, it will help you stand out., If you're just meeting a person, give them a memorable piece of information about yourself. The best kinds of hooks are funny.For instance, say you're meeting a friend of your sister at a gathering in Arizona. You could say, "Hi, I'm Carrie's sister from Oklahoma. I tried to leave the tornadoes behind, though."  , When starting up a conversation, move away from questions about the person's job or the weather. Instead, try more interesting topics, such as a local play that's running or a great book you just read. 

let your unique characteristics shine.  be authentic.  give the person a compliment.  do something unusual.  listen intently.  try a hook.  pick interesting topics. 

 This is a plant that is happy to sit on the windowsill provided it doesn't get too hot. The preferred temperature is average warmth, although the cooler the room, the happier the plant will be.; , It doesn't need a lot of watering. Too much watering can bring about root rot but too dry and the leaves will shrivel and turn yellow.  However, if you don't remember, it'll still thrive. A standard liquid fertiliser is appropriate.  Otherwise, don't worry about it. It's really only an aesthetics issue.  Rather than trying to keep the plant flourishing after flowering, it's recommended that you take cuttings from it and grow new ones for the next year. And so on, for as long as you like. Cuttings should be placed in a soil-based compost.  

position it in a light, sunny position.  keep the soil semi moist between waterings and ensure that the soil is dry before watering again.  feed it every two weeks when it's flowering.  if you want to cut the flowers off after flowering, then do so.  take cuttings. 

 There are many ways that these products can cause and exacerbate acne around the lips.The wax from lip balm clogs your pores. This traps dirt and bacteria, causing pimples to form. The fragrances in these products can stimulate sebum production. The increase of oil and sebum, coupled with clogged pores, is a good recipe for an acne breakout. The lip balm may spread the bacteria that causes pimples. If this happens, you are re-infecting yourself every time you use it. If you can't stop completely, use a fragrance-free product instead. This will still clog your pores but won't stimulate sebum production.  Crumbs or food residue left around your mouth is a feeding ground for bacteria, and may cause breakouts., Just like with flavored lip balm, chemical flavoring in toothpaste can irritate the skin and increase sebum production. Some fragrance-free toothpaste brands are Burt's Bees, Biotene, Sensodyne, and Tom's of Maine., This can help flush out your system and cleanse your skin from the inside out. Increase the amount of water you drink to help reduce acne overall. 

stop using lip balm/gloss.  wipe your mouth after eating and drinking.  use a flavor and fragrance-free toothpaste.  drink more water. 

 A good way to reward your dog for a job well done is by giving them a treat. Some good treats to use are bite size soft treats (from the pet store) or small pieces of meat.; , Call his/her name and show them the treat. If your dog isn't paying attention, they will not be able to learn the trick.  If your dog doesn't already know how to sit read the steps below. If your dog does know how to sit, move on to the next step.   Get your dog's attention Stay in the same position and wait until they sit because of boredom Reward your dog and say "sit" Repeat until your dog sits every time You could also hold the treat just above their nose and they might sit.  Now that your dog knows how to sit, you can teach them the advanced version. Have your dog sit in a place where there are no distractions. Hold a treat in your hand and move your hand over your dog's nose. Your dog should lean back and lift its front paws off of the ground. Reward your dog and say "sit pretty" Repeat until your dog sits pretty every time.  Now that your dog can sit pretty, it is time for your dog to master the trick. Have them sit pretty like usual, but this time see how long they can hold it for. If your dog is having a hard time balancing, try helping them by holding their paw. Repeat until your dog can hold the position for at least 5 seconds. Now you can show all of your friends and family what a cool dog you have! 

use treats.  get your dog's attention.  teach your dog to sit.  work on sitting pretty/begging.  master the trick. 

 One of the biggest mistakes that you can make with regards to your personal statement is not allowing yourself enough time to brainstorm, write, rewrite and edit. It is recommended that you allow yourself at least four to eight weeks to complete your personal statement.If you know that writing is particularly difficult for you, consider giving yourself 10 to 12 weeks to work on your statement. Start the process as soon as possible so as to give yourself enough time to take a break from writing and editing. This break can give you a fresh perspective when you return to writing.; , Ask yourself, “what are the three things that I would want the admissions committee to remember about me?” The personal statement may be your only opportunity for the admissions committee to know something about you as a person. It may help to write a list of characteristics that you like about yourself. Admissions committees want to see that you have the maturity and ability to assess yourself—your strengths and your weaknesses.When creating your list, consider the following:   Are you able to learn from your mistakes? Are you willing to change your opinion based on evidence? Are you willing to consider multiple points of view when making a decision? Are you able to set goals based on your strengths and weaknesses?, Once you have chosen three things that you want the committee to remember about you, it is time to think about what part of your background, beliefs, or experiences best exemplify these three characteristics.   A common saying in writing application materials is “show, don’t tell.” This means that it is better to share a story that illustrates the characteristics that you want to convey rather than make a plain statement. For example, rather than stating “I believe I will be successful in law school and as an attorney because of my ability to persevere in the face of great odds,” consider sharing a story about how you did persevere in a specific instance., After brainstorming about how to illustrate the characteristics that you want to share with the committee, determine whether there is an overarching theme or topic that connects all of your stories. For example, do your stories show how you have had to overcome something difficult or a commitment to service. You want to find a way to unify your examples in a cohesive story or topic.  Once you have an idea about what you want to write about yourself, you should take some time and read how other people conveyed their personal stories. You don’t want to mimic their story but rather consider how they crafted their personal story into a cohesive and interesting narrative. You can find statements from the University of Chicago here: http://www.law.uchicago.edu/alumni/magazine/spring11/intheirownwords  , Admissions committees are reading closely to get a sense of you as a person and judging your ability to write a well-organized and articulate essay. An outline provides a road map to guide you through your statement. It ensures that you include important information and that you are not duplicative. While there is no formula for writing a personal statement, consider including the following sections in your outline:   Write down a few ideas for your introduction. Your introductory paragraph is very important because it sets the tone for the rest of the draft. You may choose to write your introduction last once you see how all of the elements of your statement come together. Sketch out how you plan to illustrate your chosen characteristics. You may use one story to highlight your characteristics or multiple stories connected by an overarching theme. Whatever you choose, spend some time organizing your thoughts and identifying all of the points that you want to make in your essay. Include thoughts on your conclusion. A strong conclusion will tie your statement together but also leave your reader with something to think about. Your conclusion should only be a few sentences and should not rehash everything you have already written., Your introduction is incredibly important. It offers the opportunity to capture a reader’s attention and encourage them to read your statement closely. Consider the following when drafting your introduction:   Start with a personal story that illustrates your overall theme. Do not start with a quotation, poetry, or a bland statement such as “ I believe I will be successful in law school because . . .”, Once you are writing the body of the statement, the beginning of each paragraph should also capture the reader’s attention. Any statements that you make should be supported by examples from your own life. For example, if you choose effective communication as your theme, show the ways that you have effectively communicated or how ineffective communication made you focus on this skill.  When writing your statement, you should always write in your own voice. Don’t try to show an expansive vocabulary but rather write clearly, concisely and in a way that feels most natural to you., While it is a good idea to create a basic personal statement to work from, you should carefully read the instructions from each school to which you are applying and add or change your personal statement to meet their requirements. These requirements may include page limits or font size or different substantive questions to which you need to respond.   For examples of law school question prompts go to: http://hpplc.indiana.edu/documents/PersonalstatementsforlawschoolJune32013.pdf. If a school does not include page limits, your statement should be between 2 to 4 pages., You should expect to have three to four drafts of your personal statement. Once you have a draft that you think is finished, you should do a close read of the statement for grammar and spelling mistakes. Do not rely solely on spell check.   There are numerous online grammar tools that you can reference if you have any questions. You can locate these tools be conducting an internet search for “grammar tools.” You should read the statement out loud to yourself. Often, hearing the statement out loud will alert you to awkward phrasing or other issues. Try to write in active voice. For a description of active versus passive voice visit: https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/539/02/.  After correcting spelling and grammar mistakes, your second round of edits should focus on how your statement is written. You want your statement to be written clearly and concisely, which means if there is a way to say something in one words versus three words, you should choose one word., After you have edited your statement for mistakes and clarity, you should not review the statement for at least a few days. When you return to your statement, read through it again and make any necessary changes.  You should never be the only person to review your personal statement before including it in your law school application. You should have at least two people review your statement and give you feedback on the content, as well as an grammar or spelling issues.   If your undergraduate school has a pre-law advisor, consider asking this person to review your statement. You should also consider asking faculty mentors to review your statement.  

give yourself enough time.  assess your strengths and weaknesses.  brainstorm on how to best demonstrate your characteristics.  evaluate your experiences for an overall theme.  review samples of successful personal statements.  create an outline of your personal statement.  write a strong introduction.  back up your statements with evidence.  write in your own words.  tailor your statement to each school.  read your draft for grammar and spelling mistakes.  edit your draft so that it is clear and concise.  take time away from your statement.  ask two trusted people to review your essay. 

 Most people who have Japanese encephalitis have either no symptoms or mild, short-lived symptoms that are flu-like in presentation — mild-to-moderate fever, fatigue, headache and sometimes vomiting.As such, it's very difficult to identify most cases of Japanese encephalitis because it either causes no symptoms or mimics most other mild infections.   It's estimated that less than 1% of people infected with the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) develop noticeable symptoms.In people who do develop symptoms, the incubation period (time from initial infection until signs of illness) is typically between five to 15 days.; , Although most JEV infections produce mild or no symptoms, about 1 in 250 cases result in severe illness, which often starts with a severe fever.A severe fever is a defense mechanism by your body to slow down or stop the production of invading viruses (or bacteria), but when they get much beyond 103 °F (39.4 °C) in adults or 101 °F (38.3 °C) in children, there is a risk of brain damage. The high fever and increased inflammation in the brain caused by JEV trigger other serious and life-threatening symptoms.   Once significant symptoms develop with Japanese encephalitis, usually in children with weakened immune systems, the chances of dying are about 30%.Mild cases of Japanese encephalitis can increase your temperature by a couple of degrees, but severe cases spike it by five or more degrees.  Like other types of infections that affect the brain and/or spinal cord (such as meningitis), a stiff neck can develop with Japanese encephalitisThe neck suddenly feels stiff and is difficult to move in all directions, but it generates especially sharp, shooting or electric-like pain with neck flexion (trying to touch your chin to your chest).   When the spinal cord gets inflamed, the muscles closest to the spine get very tight in efforts to protect it, which is called guarding or splinting. As such, the neck muscles will be hard to the touch and feel like they are spasming. Medication, massage or chiropractic care will not resolve a stiff neck from Japanese encephalitis, meningitis or other infections of the central nervous system.  Another effect triggered by brain inflammation and a severe fever is mental changes, such as disorientation, confusion, difficulty focusing and even the inability to speak.Behavioral changes are often interrelated and include irritability and/or poor temper control, as well as wanting to be alone and avoiding social contact.The more serious symptoms of Japanese encephalitis, once they begin, usually only take a few days or so to become significant and serious. The mental and behavioral changes associated with severe JEV infection can mimic a stroke or Alzheimer's disease. The person will change from a healthy, functioning individual to one with severe mental and physical deterioration. Realizing the signs and symptoms and getting prompt treatment are imperative to improving your chances of survival.  Once Japanese encephalitis takes a turn for the worse with increasing swelling and high temperatures, the neurons in the brain start to get damaged and die off. Once this happens, neurological symptoms begin to become obvious, such as uncontrollable shaking of body parts (tremors), muscle weakness or paralysis, difficulty walking and grasping things, and reduced coordination (clumsy looking).Muscle weakness and paralysis usually starts in the limbs (arms and legs) and progressively spreads around the body, but the face can also be affected initially. Of those who survive a severe bout of Japanese encephalitis (which is about 70% of cases), about 1/4 suffer permanent neurological and/or behavioral problems and disabilities., The progression of a severe bout of Japanese encephalitis invariably ends with seizures, which are triggered by brain swelling, high fever and electrical disruption/discharge in the neurons of the brain.The seizures involve collapse, shaking, muscle spasms, jaw clenching and sometimes vomiting or frothing at the mouth.   Seizures triggered by encephalitis can mimic those of epilepsy but can be far more life-threatening due to brain damage. Children with encephalitis are much more likely than adults to have seizures because their smaller brains are more susceptible to pressure and increased temperatures.Once seizures begin, becoming unconscious and slipping into a coma is not uncommon.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the safest and most effective form of prevention from Japanese encephalitis is getting vaccinated against it.The four main types of vaccines currently in use to prevent JEV infection are an inactivated mouse brain-derived vaccine, an inactivated Vero cell-derived vaccine, a live attenuated vaccine, and a live recombinant vaccine. Get vaccinated at least six to eight weeks prior to your trip to Asia to allow your body enough time to build up protective antibodies.   The most widely used vaccine against JEV infection is the live attenuated SA14-14-2 vaccine made in China.The higher risk areas of Asia for Japanese encephalitis are the rural parts of Japan, China or Southeast Asia — get vaccinated before you go to these places to reduce your risk. The Japanese encephalitis vaccination can require several doses over the course of a few weeks or months Keep in mind that encephalitis can actually be caused or worsened by vaccination (any type of vaccine) due to an allergic reaction to the ingredients., Another form of protection against JEV infection is controlling mosquitoes and avoiding getting bit, as the insects are the main vector for the disease.As such, avoid or remove any sources of standing water where mosquitoes can breed and always use an insect repellent containing a chemical called DEET (Off!, Cutter, Sawyer, Ultrathon). In addition, sleep in beds with protective mosquito nets (or other coverings) and avoid going outside between dusk and dawn when more mosquitoes are active and airborne.   Most insect repellents last for up to six hours and some are water resistant. DEET products shouldn't be used on infants younger than two months. Natural forms of insect repellent include lemon oil and eucalyptus oil. Preventing mosquitoes from biting you when traveling abroad will also reduce your risk of getting other serious diseases, such as malaria and West Nile virus.  In addition to using insect repellent and mosquito netting, you should also wear appropriate protective clothing while traveling in Asia, particularly while in the rural countryside. As such, wear long-sleeved shirts and thin cotton gloves (popular in many Asian countries) to cover your entire arms and hands.For your legs, wear long pants with socks and shoes when you're outside, especially when walking in marshy or grassy areas.   Asia is very warm and humid for most of the year, so choose breathable pants and long-sleeved shirts so you don't get overheated. However, keep in mind that mosquitoes can bite through thin clothing, so spray your clothes with insect repellent to be on the safe side. Don't apply insect repellents containing permethrin to your skin.  If you're in Asia, avoid activities that significantly increase your risk of getting bit and infected by mosquitoes, such as outdoor camping, hiking and exploring on motorcycles or bicycles.Not only are these activities usually done in rural areas, but you're also vulnerable due to exposure. Choose sightseeing trips in enclosed vehicles (tour buses) while in rural areas and wear protective clothing, as noted above.   If you absolutely must sleep outside in rural areas of Asia, then it's essential to cover your tent or dwelling in mosquito nets that are impregnated with a strong insecticide. While in the countryside, only sleep in hotel rooms with close-fitting gauze or screens over the windows and doors., Another form of prevention, albeit a drastic one, is to not travel to Asian countries that are known to be endemic for Japanese encephalitis — which is actually most countries in Asia. This is easy advice to follow for a curious traveler with no family ties or connections to Asia, but not practical for many people who must travel there for business or family reasons. In reality, the risk of getting infected is very, very small — it's estimated that less than one in a million travelers who travel to Asia develop Japanese encephalitis per year.More practical advice is to avoid the rural areas of Asia if you travel there, particularly farming areas that have lots of pigs and cows. The people at greatest risk of JEV infection are those who live and work in rural areas where the disease is widespread, particularly children under the age of 15 years.If you have a choice, avoid traveling to Asian countries during their rainy seasons (it varies from place to place) when mosquito populations are larger and more of a threat.  

take notice of mild flu-like symptoms.  be aware of a high fever.  watch for a stiff neck.  be alert to mental or behavioral changes.  look for neurological damage.  be ready for seizures.  get vaccinated.  avoid mosquito bites.  wear protective clothing.  avoid risky outdoor activities.  don't travel to asia. 

 Hate Pokémon? Then don't stick a Bulbasaur to your DS.; , Most cheap stickers are permanent, and will probably leave a residue even if they aren't.  But remember, if you make a total Trubbish of this, then you need a very steady hand to fix it.  Be careful, you don't want broken consoles on your conscience.  

think about what you want.  think about where you're putting things.  if you want to, cut off bits you don't like.  when you want to remove the sticker, don't use anything that can damage the inner workings. 

 Where you find mullet will vary depending on what part of the world you live in, and which kind of mullet you are fishing for. Tidal rivers, estuaries, harbours and canals are all good places to find mullet. They are often close to the surface and in big schools, so if they are there, you should be able to spot them.   They are often found in big groups on a rising tide as they feed on algae., You don't need elaborate tackle to go after mullet. Just be sure to have a light rod with a click-drag reel. You will need long leaders with a 6lbs test strength as well as fine diameter lines to counter the mullet's excellent eyesight., Baiting for a mullets can be a tricky task, with all sorts of baits recommended and discouraged. No bait is every a certainty, and this is especially the case for the algae and invertebrate feeding mullet. There are a number of baiting options that have been successful for you to consider and experiment with. These include:   Ragworm.Bread or dough. Peeled prawn., Given that mullets gather in schools near the surface, using a fly can be good way to fish them. You'll need a small fly, and don't expect a bright flashy lure will work on the bottom feeding mullets. Try tossing some clumps of oatmeal into the water and casting in front of the mullet as they feed.A bread and oatmeal batter mix can be effective when fly fishing for mullet.  Once you've got a bite, you'll soon discover that despite their relatively modest size, mullets are fighters on the hook. Take care as you reel them in, don't try to pull them in too quickly. You can consider using a landing net for the final catch.   Using a braid line will help you feel the movements of the mullet in the water.Remember that mullets can really leap up out of water, so take extra care when landing them or they could jump off and away.  

find a prime spot for mullet.  prepare your tackle.  prepare your bait.  consider using a fly.  reel them in carefully. 

 Get involved in the lives of your children, parents, siblings and other members of your immediate family. Call them up regularly to check in and schedule time to hang out. Spend some time each day interacting with your family.   You might even plan a family reunion.  In addition to family, spend time with friends as well. If possible, avoid going to the movies or over to their house to watch a show. Instead, plan dinners, mini vacations to the beach, or trips to the bowling alley or skating rink., Beyond your family and friends, there are likely many others that you interact with on a day to day basis like the janitor who works in your office, the lunch lady in your school, or your coworkers. Instead of tuning them out or putting in your headphones, engage with them in conversation. This will help you stay more connected to the real world., Take a good look around you and attend to any household duties that may need to be taken care of. This can include anything from fixing a leaking tap to fixing up the garden. Improving your cooking or cuisine skills is also another option to consider.  Register for any courses that you are interested in or even consider going back to school. This will make a great and significant demand on your time. This will also keep you occupied and productive., There are many other activities to engage in besides television. Spend some time exploring old hobbies of yours and developing new ones. You can do things like read, ride horses, dance, or garden., There is a whole exciting world outside of your home that you have likely not explored because of your TV addiction. Get out in your neighborhood and take a walk. Go hiking or camping with friends. Get out on the lake and go canoeing or kayaking. These activities are good for both physical and mental health. 

interact with family.  spend time with friends.  practice mindfulness in all interactions.  take care of your home.  take a class.  choose another hobby.  get outdoors. 

 You can book a reservation at your favorite restaurant or you can cook. It doesn’t even have to be fine dining. Often just putting something together in advance is a good way to show your Valentine that you care and that you’re thinking of them. Add some candles, turn down the lights, and it's a perfect romantic evening.; , If you’re like most people, there are probably so many things to do in your area that you’ve just never gotten around to. Spend an entire day exploring with your significant other, and make a point of going places neither of you have ever been before. Go to a new museum, go paintballing together, or hike a long trail that you’ve both been interested in, but never had the time for. You never know--you might even get to see a fun new side of the person you love., It sounds so cliché, until you realize that it has been forever since you last took an hour or two to simply sit down across from them at a table to talk. Put your phones on silent and out of sight, and just give each other your full attention.  If you go to a nature preserve or big park, bring a field guide to birds or wild flowers and have fun working together to identify what you see. If you’re in the city, do a self-guided walking tour together, wander down adorable side streets you’ve never noticed before, and make lots of stops to smell the roses.  Book a few nights at a cosy bed and breakfast, or visit a nearby city for a few days. You might have to tell them to set aside the weekend for something special, but they don't have to know where you're going. Go all out, and make it a weekend to remember., Swing dances often include a brief lesson beforehand for beginners and people who want to brush up on rusty skills, and they can be a lot of fun. Or get up close and personal with a tango class. Nothing says romantic like a jazzy number and a beckoning dance floor. 

arrange for dinner.  plan a day out.  take your partner out for coffee.  go for a long walk together.  surprise your significant other with a weekend away.  take your partner out dancing. 

 Most people buy chicken eggs, but there are other kinds of eggs available at stores and markets that may better suit your needs:          Turkey eggs are very similar in nutrition and flavor to chicken eggs, but larger. Since these eggs are difficult to produce on a commercial scale, they are usually not available.Duck eggs - These eggs have more protein in the whites and fat in the yolks than chicken eggsso substituting them for chicken eggs in certain recipes is not recommended unless you can adjust accordingly. Goose eggs - These have more fat content than chicken eggs, so they can make for richer dishes, but they're not good for frying.Ostrich eggs - These massive eggs are usually opened carefully with a hammer. When scrambled, the texture is lighter and fluffier than that of a chicken egg and it has a milder, faintly sweeter taste.Quail eggs - They taste pretty much just like chicken eggs, but their small size can make for unique presentation. They are also hard to open without breaking the yolk.Sometimes they are eaten raw in sushi.; , Most countries have grading systems for chicken eggs, usually based on weight. See the section below for information from various localities showing the different standards used by consumers to purchase eggs.           Organic eggs generally come from chickens that are fed organic feed (little or no pesticide and herbicide use, non-GMO) and are not given antibiotics unless necessary to control infection. They are given access to the outdoors for at least some part of the year, although that does not mean they actually go outdoors."Free range" and "cage free" are terms not regulated in the US, which means anyone can label any egg "free range" no matter how the chickens were raised. The best way to determine how the hens are raised is to purchase your eggs from a farmer whose farm you can visit to see for yourself.  This will help you avoid food poisoning in raw cookie dough, homemade mayonnaise, eggnog or any dish that has uncooked or lightly cooked eggs.  The Julian date (JD) is a 3-digit number that corresponds to the calendar day, out of 365, that the eggs were packaged. If you want fresh eggs, try to find a JD that is as close as possible to the current day.         

decide which kinds of eggs you need.  become familiar with how eggs are graded in your area.  look further into the standards for "premium" eggs.  if you will be consuming the egg raw, look for pasteurized eggs.  look for the expiration date and date code (julian date) to determine freshness. 

 If you do not already have it, you can download it from https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-computer/.; , Enter your username and password and click “Sign in”.  This is located in the upper left corner of the window.  You will be redirected to the Skype credit page in your web browser.  Skype credit is a flat fee purchase that give you a set amount of dollar value to use for calls.   You can also opt to purchase a Skype subscription. These can sometimes offer cheaper rates, but are only a good choice for frequent users.  Most calls to phones will cost a few cents per minute,so even the minimum purchase will be sufficient for a few calls.   If Skype credit is not used within 180 days, it will become inactive and need to be reactivated on your account., You will need a valid credit card number, expiration date, CVV, and billing address to complete a purchase.   The credit will be added to your account immediately upon purchase.  Back in the Skype application, this is the second options from the left under the search bar. A separate call window will appear.   You can also select “Call Phone” from the “Call” menu or hit Ctrl+D.  The entry field is located at the top of the window.   Suggestions will appear for mobile phones of your Skype contacts as you type. If you don’t know the country code, you can click “Choose country/region” under the entry field and select the appropriate country.  This button is located to the right of the phone number entry field.   You must have a working microphone to successfully call from your computer. You can go to “Tools > Options > Audio Quality” to test your microphone.  

open skype.  sign in to your account.  open the “skype” menu.  select “buy skype credit”.  choose “skype credit”.  choose a credit amount.  enter your payment information.  click the dial pad icon.  enter the phone number (with country/area code).  click the phone icon to call. 

 Consider the size of the target, the number of potential entry points and the security mechanisms that may be in place. A hacker should think about company names and subsidiaries, phone numbers, domain names and their IP networks.; , For example, identify startup companies that most likely have weak security, especially those recently acquired by large companies. Hacking into these smaller companies may provide information about the unrestricted virtual private networks the larger target companies.  Many TCP and UDP services send data that will identify the running application as a response to random data. You can find exploits by cross-referencing the data you find in vulnerability databases, like SecurityFocus.  You will need a password and user account, which is usually acquired through a sneak attack. That is, many hackers will take information from a company website and directly contact an employee by phone, pretending to be the help desk or a web technician. Many unsuspecting employees will give valuable information to a person who sounds authoritative.  For example, you can enter with the user's name and password and replace an everyday piece of software like Notepad.exe with a piece of Trojan code. This code can allow a hacker to become an administrator in the system, so that the next time that the hacker logs on, they will automatically be added to the administrators' group and will have instant access to "admin only" information.  

identify possible exploits and their domain names, gathering as much information as you can to create a footprint analysis.  pay attention to "back door" entry points.  connect to the listening udp and tcp ports of your possible targets and send random data, attempting to determine what versions of file transfer protocol, web, or mail servers that they may be using.  think about how you will gain access to the target once you have learned the basic information.  take the username and password obtained and "trojan" the system. 

 The florets shouldn’t have gaps, and the leaves should extend over the top. White cauliflower stays colorless because the leaves cover the florets, keeping them away from the sun.; , Avoid any curds that are browning or discolored in spots. This is an indication that they have been on the shelf too long.   If you are buying a purple, green or orange variety, look for browning on the leaves and base of the curd. The brighter green the better.  You can purchase florets instead of a whole curd. The florets will deteriorate faster than a whole head, so plan to use them within 2 days.  It will be fresh for 5 to 7 days. , Put a large pot of water on the stovetop to boil. Pour the cauliflower florets in and boil for 3 minutes.  Remove the florets and place them in an ice water bath. Remove, drain and freezer or place in the refrigerator. Blanched cauliflower can be frozen for up to a year. , Slice through the line where the stem meets the head.  They can be used in place of broccoli, spinach or other bitter greens. Discard them if they aren’t fresh.  Insert a paring knife at a 45-degree angle and slice in a circular motion. Discard the woody core when it is removed from the florets., You should cut where the remaining core meets the stem. Move in a circle, dislodging each cluster around the curd. , Separate the small tree-like florets into bite-sized pieces. If they are difficult to snap off, use your paring knife to cut them into small pieces. , Rinse them thoroughly.  Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a saucepan. Place a steamer tray inside the pan, and then pour in the cauliflower florets.   Cover the saucepan. Cook for 5 minutes for a small batch of 10 minutes for a large batch.       You can also keep the cauliflower curd whole and steam it for 15 minutes.  Keep the cauliflower curd whole and cut an “x” in the bottom stem that is 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) deep. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil.   Set the cauliflower head inside the water. Let it boil for 20 to 25 minutes. If you are using florets, only let them boil for 5 to 10 minutes. Drain the water; add milk, butter and seasonings. Mash the cauliflower with a potato masher. Serve as you would mashed potatoes. Puree the cauliflower in a food processor, instead of mashing it. Use the puree as a base for soups or dips.  Florets will be cooked after 15 to 20 minutes in a simmered liquid.  Heat 1 tbsp. (14.8 ml) of olive oil. Add a sliced garlic clove. Pour in the florets and Sauté until they are golden and softened.   Consider adding a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and some chopped thyme before serving.  Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius). Toss the cauliflower florets with 1 tbsp. of olive oil, salt, pepper and caraway seeds.   Pour them onto a baking sheet and place them in the oven. Roast for 20 minutes or until golden brown. 

look for a cauliflower curd, or head, that is tightly packed.  judge most varieties by how white they are.  buy fresh, pre-cut cauliflower florets to save on prep time.  place the cauliflower in an open plastic bag or keep it in its original packaging until you can cook it.  blanch fresh cauliflower, if you can’t prepare it within 2 to 5 days.  turn the curd on its side.  use the cauliflower leaves and stem if they are very fresh.  turn the curd downward, so that the head is resting on your cutting board.  cut the stem of each cluster of florets with your knife.  break away the small florets from each other using your hands.  place the florets in a strainer basket.  steam the cauliflower.  boil and mash the cauliflower.  immerse your cauliflower in a sauce, stew or soup.  sauté fresh cauliflower.  roast your florets.  make cauliflower gratin.  

 Put it into a medium sized bowl.  Add it to the diced garlic and onion., Add the diced tomatoes. Blend using a hand blender, until smooth. Heat over high heat., Stir to combine., Stir well and cook for a short time, to soften.,, Transfer the souped-up soup to serving bowls. Serve with crusty, herb or garlic bread, without delay. Enjoy––your guests will think it was made completely from scratch. 

dice the garlic and the onion.  chop up the cilantro.  pour the tomato soup into a saucepan.  pour in the water and milk.  add the mixture of onion, garlic and cilantro.add salt and pepper to taste.  serve. 

 These are signs that the plant is trying to make up for insufficient sunlight.Don't move it straight to direct sunlight, since that damages most bromeliads. Move to an area of sunnier, mottled shade or nearer a window that receives indirect sunlight first. Move it again if the leaves don't correct themselves in a couple weeks.  Move your bromeliad to a shader area of your yard, or place it further from windows that receive direct sunlight. Make a more drastic change in sunlight conditions if the sun is burning brown holes onto the leaves.   If your plant should be able to withstand more sunlight according to a label or expert, it may have been cared for improperly by the previous owners. Acclimate it to the correct conditions by periodically moving it to a slightly brighter area., If the leaf size and overall colors haven't changed, but you notice one of these problems, the sunlight is probably fine but the plant needs more water:Mist the bromeliad every day when it's not exposed to direct sunlight. Keep the central cup of the plant full of water if one is present. Plant other plants a short distance from your bromeliad. Each plant raises the humidity in its immediate area. Run a humidifier in the same room as your plant, or create your own non-powered humidifier by placing pebbles in a tray and filling it with water to just below the surface of the rocks.  If you have an "air plant" with no soil to draw water from, you should be misting it every few days. To repair the dried out leaves immediately, immerse the air plant in water for a few minutes, then hold upside and check to make sure all the water drains out from between the leaves.Trapped water pockets can cause rot.  This is a sign of too much mineral buildup. Take these steps to remove the problem and deal with the immediate issue:   Use rainwater or distilled water instead of tap water to care for your bromeliad. Pour water over the plant or into the central cup until the pot drains or the soil is good and moist. This flushes out the excess minerals, but should be done sparingly since it can cause the roots to rot. Turn small indoor plants upside down over the sink afterward to help them drain. Stop using fertilizer, or at least dilute it to half the strength you're currently using.  The most common pests are scale and mealybugs, which create the described appearance. Wipe a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol over the affected area every day or two until it subsides.For widespread or persistent outbreaks, mix baby shampoo or mild dishwashing detergent with water and spray onto the plants to suffocate the insects. Rinse the plant shortly afterward to maintain the leaves' access to air. If you are forced to resort to insecticides, avoid thick or oil-based ones which can suffocate the plant. Bromeliads rely on their leaves to draw in some nutrients and water, so only use insecticides as a last resort.  

move the plant to an area of more sunlight if the leaves become larger and greener.  move the plant out of sunlight if it withers or if colors fade.  increase the humidity if the soil won't stay moist or the leaf tips turn brown.  rehydrate dry or withered leaves of an air bromeliad.  change your caring methods if you notice white buildup near the base of the leaves.  treat round dots or white patches that result from pest attacks. 

 Flick up a switch to the back of the presser foot or on the side of the machine. There is a presser bar lever located in one of these positions.; , Raise the needle to its highest position., These are usually two plastic pins located on the top or near the base that hold your spools of thread. Locate the stool pins and remove them.  Insert the spool pin on top of the spool. It is required to keep the spool pins in place.   You only need two spools of thread if you are using two needles.  Draw out a foot of extra thread with which you will thread the upper portion of the machine. Cut the end of the thread so that it is easier to thread through the needle.  Bring the thread through the first hole and pull it through the partial hole on the other side. It should be threaded from the bottom through the top of the partial hole and then stretched downward.  If you are threading two spools of thread, the first one should pass through the right side of the upper thread tension disk and the back spool should thread through the left side of the upper thread tension disk. They will attach to two different needles.  It should catch on the thread guide lightly as you pull it through and continue downward.  Then, pass the end of the thread through the eye of the needle. Pull at least four inches (10cm) of thread through the needles.   Note that the thread from a second spool should go from the back spool, to the left side of the tension disk and through the eye of the left needle. , This is the metal compartment in which the bobbin or backing thread is stored.  Many Necchi machines have bobbin cases and you must pull up on the latch to release the bobbin and pull it out.  This thread color should be chosen to go on the underside of your project. Pull out two inches (five cm) of excess thread from the bobbin.  The bobbin must turn clockwise, so ensure it is going this direction when you insert it.  It will go underneath the tension spring. Pull the thread another two inches forward.  Hold it open. Place the bobbin case onto the center pin in the shuttle race.  Check to see if the bobbin case is secured. Close the shuttle race cover.  Turn your hand wheel toward you until the needle goes down through the floor of the machine and up again.  Pull this thread out further.  Now, you can use your sewing machine. 

raise the presser foot.  turn the balance when toward you.  find the spool pins on your machine.  place one or two full spools of thread onto the spool pins, with the thread going toward the presser foot in a clockwise direction.  test that each spool turns without problems.  notice the thread guide, a small round pin with an attached piece of metal.  pull it down through the upper thread tension dial.  pull it under the check spring thread guide.  pass the thread through the front loop on the presser foot.  pull the excess thread through the bottom of the presser foot and pull it backward.  ,  open the shuttle race cover on the bottom of the sewing machine, near the presser foot.  unlatch the bobbin case and pull it out of the machine.  grab a bobbin full of thread.  insert the bobbin into the bobbin case.  guide the excess thread through the slot in the bobbin case.  open the latch of your bobbin case.  release the latch on the bobbin case.  hold your previously threaded upper thread with your left hand to keep it from moving out of the needle.  watch as the bobbin thread is pulled up in a loop.  pull both threads backwards, so that they are lying behind the presser foot. 

 You might feel a slight, or severe, dizzy spell immediately before you faint. This is a strong warning sign that your circulation system is not functioning normally. As soon as you start to feel dizzy at all, stop what you are doing and try to get lower to the ground via sitting or lying down., Your senses will most likely be affected as well in the minutes right before you faint. You may experience tunnel vision or feeling as if your vision is collapsing into one small tunnel to look through. You may see spots or blurs. Your ears might start to ring or feel as if they are giving off a slight buzz.Other major symptoms include a clammy and pale face, numbness in your face and exterior limbs, feelings of severe anxiety, or sudden onset nausea or stomach pains.  When you experience any symptoms related to fainting, the goal is to get as low as possible as quickly as you can. Many people receive serious injuries not from the fainting, but from the fall to the ground connected with the loss of consciousness. It is best to lie down on your back or side, but if that is not an option it is okay just to sit down.When you lie down it puts your head at roughly the same level as your heart and encourages circulation to be restored and your blood to head back to your brain easier. If you are pregnant you should lie down (and usually sleep as well) on your left side to lessen the burden on your heart.If the area is crowded, for example, and it is only safe to sit down that can work as well. For maximum benefit, hang your head between your legs. This will encourage the blood to follow gravity and head back down into your brain., If you are in a crowded area it is probably best to touch a wall and slowly try to lean yourself against it. If needed, you may slide yourself slowly down the wall. This will prevent you from being trampled while you are on the ground. Getting away from the crowd might also lower your temperature and make breathing easier.  If it is too late to lie down in a controlled way, then you will want to control the direction of your fall as much as you can. As you begin to lose consciousness, do your best to angle your body towards a wall if there is one within arm’s reach. This will allow you to slide down the wall instead of going into a free fall.   You can also make an effort to buckle your knees. This will have the effect of lowering you to the ground and will lessen your final fall.  If you are on stairs and the symptoms start to appear, move from the inner rail to the outer one connected to a wall. Sit down on a stair. If you are close to a landing, try to scoot down on your behind to it where you can then lie down.   If you feel yourself going down before you can sit, try your best to maintain a firm grip on the rail. It can help to guide you down to the floor even as you lose consciousness. If nothing else, draping your body partially over the outer rail (against the wall) will slow the course of your fall and turn it into a slide down.  Call out for assistance using your voice. If your voice isn’t working properly, wave your hands in the air and mouth out the word “help” repeatedly. Be careful trying to walk towards someone to get help as you could go down mid-step.   If you see someone you might say, “Help! I’m about to pass out!” Or, “Can you help me? I think I’m going to faint.” Don’t be afraid to approach strangers who may be able to help you stay safe. If you are lucky and someone helps you, they should start by assisting you to the floor if you are not there already. If you do fall and injure yourself, they should apply pressure to the bleeding area and call for medical assistance.The person assisting should also remove any tight clothing that could be constricting blood flow to your head, such as tight neckties.They will need to make sure your airway is clear and stays that way. It may be necessary to tilt you to the side if you begin vomiting. They should check for signs that you are breathing properly, even when unconscious. If anything looks concerning, they should dial for emergency assistance immediately and wait until help arrives.  

watch for dizziness.  watch for changes in vision and hearing.  sit or lie down immediately.  get yourself some space.  try to fall against a wall.  be very careful on stairs.  ask someone for help. 

 Even if there aren't any leaks in your home, you may still develop mold problems if the air is very damp. This may be particularly problematic in wet, humid environments. One way to reduce this problem is by improving your home's air quality to produce a cooler, drier environment.Use a dehumidifier to pull moisture out of the air. Try to keep your home's level of humidity between 30 to 50 percent, and be sure to clean out the dehumidifier on a regular basis (every day, if you can). Use air conditioning in your home, ideally with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. You should also change the filters in your air conditioner and furnace on a regular basis.  Your home may not have a mold problem, but if you sleep with your windows open you may be exposing yourself to outdoor mold spores. Because the air tends to be cooler and damper at night than during the day, mold spore concentrations are typically highest in the air at night., If you know you will be encountering a mold problem, wear a dust mask that completely covers your nose and mouth and disposable protective gloves. This will help prevent mold spores from entering your airways or irritating your skin.Use protective gear if you intend to clean an existing mold problem, fix a damp/wet environment in your home, or do yard work after a lot of precipitation. You can purchase protective gear at most home improvement stores or through an online retailer. Look for an N-95 respirator mask, which will protect your respiratory system from mold exposure. Kill the mold while wearing protective gear. Your protective gear should include an N-95 respirator, nitrile gloves, and a disposable gown.  Some people with severe reactions to mold may need to limit their exposure to outdoor air when mold spore concentrations are at their highest. If at all possible, limit outdoor time on those days and try to avoid strenuous activity as much as you can.Most weather reports include a mold count for the day. This can tell you what the expected prevalence of airborne mold spores will be for a given day. Check your region's mold counts and limit or avoid outdoor activities on days when the mold count is high.  If your home has any mold, you'll need to act fast before it gets worse. Treating the health problems caused by mold will only reduce your symptoms; the only way to solve the problem permanently is to remove the mold from your home. Your best course of action is to contact a professional who specializes in mold removal.   You can find professionals who work with mold by checking your local phone book or by searching online. If you or someone you know does not have a known mold allergy, you may be able to clean up a small mold patch on your own. Be sure to wear proper protection: protective eyewear, a breathing mask, and rubber gloves. You can purchase a commercial cleaning product designed to treat mold, or mix one ounce (29.5 milliliters) of bleach in one quart (0.95 milliliters) of water., When it comes to mold, it's best to take preventative measures and reduce the chances of developing a problem in the first place. You can do this by reducing the moisture levels in your home and cleaning or removing objects that have grown mold.Clean your shower and/or bathtub on a regular basis. Mildew and mold can quickly build on the walls and curtains of your shower if left unattended. Fix any leaky pipes or water seepage immediately and clean up any standing water or condensation. Dampness, especially in cool, dark areas like a basement, can quickly lead to mold growth. Get rid of old paper products, particularly newspapers and books. Leaving these items in a damp environment like your basement can cause mold to develop very quickly. Use a fan to help ventilate your bathroom and prevent mold from growing.  

improve the air quality in your home.  close your windows at night.  wear protective gear when you clean.  avoid exposure to airborne mold spores.  locate a professional to get rid of existing mold.  prevent mold from growing. 

 You will need to figure out the rate and collect it on all sales in your state to submit in the future. Read your state's laws on collecting tax for online sales.  Buy receipt books from office supply stores that have carbon copies. Give the white copy to your customer and save all carbon copies for bookkeeping purchases.  If you make more than a couple of sales each year, you should have a program that organizes your costs, inventory, prices, sales and more for easy bookkeeping.   Buy bookkeeping software, such as Quickbooks to keep your information all in 1 place. You can also try the online bookkeeping sites, Stitch Labs or Outright, which is intended for craft sellers. You can keep track of your sales from all venues, inventory, expenses and business contacts for a monthly fee of $10 to $25 per month. The advantage of these products is that they keep a double-entry system, the standard for accurate accounting. If you do not make enough in sales to warrant the expense of bookkeeping software, keep very detailed spreadsheets. Keep a sheet for every month of the year. List reoccurring expenses, variable expenses, each individual sale and tax collected. Calculate your income on an ongoing basis, instead of waiting until the end of the month. If you do not know how to work formulas in a spreadsheet program, sign up to take a class with a community college, lifelong learning center or public library.  Once you have a dedicated account, you are able to pay for expenses through the account and deposit your sales income. Your online statement will give you an opportunity to double check your accounting work to ensure your check book balances according to your spreadsheet or bookkeeping system.  Don't allow your bookkeeping to get too far behind, so enter sales as soon as possible. Save your receipts in a file folder in chronological order.   If you use an online bookkeeping system, you may want to invest in a free online receipt tracking site like shoeboxed.com. You can scan all your receipts from both expenses and sales and save them under headings. This will eliminate the risk of losing your receipts, if you have them in 2 places.  List the sales individually under the venue. Then, input the expenses associated with each individual fair, seller or online site to figure out the profitability of that venue.   Online and software bookkeeping programs should allow you to do this automatically by associating each sale and expense with a type of account. Use your spreadsheet or program to regularly assess your income and remove any channels that aren't profitable.  Do not wait until the end of the year to find mistakes that can cost you money or put you at risk for an audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  If you have large revenue from craft sales, you may be required to submit quarterly or bi-annual returns as well as yearly returns. Although this may take more time, it can allow you to pay taxes slowly, instead of in 1 lump sum.  If you have a large amount of sales, receipts and expenses, then a tax professional is more likely to help you pay accurate taxes. By having a strong grasp of small businesses, an accountant may be able to save you money through tax credits and exemptions.  

research your state's sales tax.  produce a receipt for all your sales.  invest in inventory and accounting technology.  open up a business checking account and a business credit card.  enter your receipts into your spreadsheet or software program after fairs or after a week of online sales.  keep a separate spreadsheet for each venue that you sell.  reconcile your bank account, online marketplace and spreadsheet/bookkeeping records every month.  keep a regular schedule of submitting sales and income tax.  consider hiring an accountant. 

 While researchers have yet to totally narrow down the roots of ADHD, there are some factors that stand out. For one, ADHD is prevalent in children from all walks of life and ethnic backgrounds. Several genes appear to be linked to ADHD and it runs in families. Other potential culprits that may lead to ADHD are:diets heavy in food additives, which might exacerbate symptoms diets low in omega-3 fatty acids maternal smoking and drinking complications at birth or low birth weight environmental exposure to toxins or lead brain injury; , ADHD is as unique as the individuals it affects. Nonetheless, there are a range of symptoms that typically present in children who suffer from this disorder. These symptoms interfere with a child's ability to function at school, at home, or in friendships.   Teachers and school administrators may alert you to problems in your child that may not be identifiable at home. Symptom presentation must be recognizable within the first 12 years of life and kids with ADHD must experience at least six symptoms, such as:frequently forgetting things fidgeting or squirming being easily distracted losing books, toys, or other possessions act impatiently frequently interrupt others' conversations talk/sing/hum too much demonstrate trouble following instructions require extensive instructions to begin tasks having trouble taking turns run around a lot constantly switch back and forth between tasks    , Kids with ADHD generally receive one of three diagnoses. These subtypes depend on how symptoms are exhibited. Children with ADHD may experience changes in their symptom presentation over time; therefore, their diagnosis may change types. The three subtypes of ADHD are:Predominantly inattentive type. Children with this type are easily distracted, forgetful, lose things often, do not seem to be listening when spoken to, avoid or dislike tasks that require longer spans of concentration or mental effort, and are disorganized for the past 6 months.  Predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type. Children with this type talk excessively, fidget and squirm when seated, seem to always on the go, blurt out answers to questions, have difficulty awaiting their turn, and demonstrates restlessness by climbing or jumping at times when it's inappropriate to do so for the past 6 months.  Combined type. This ADHD subtype is diagnosed when both the criteria for inattentive type and hyperactive-impulsive type are equally present for the past 6 months.  Many adults with ADHD may not recognize that they have a problem. More than likely, you do not have ADHD if your symptoms began only recently or are present in only one area of your life (diagnosis in adulthood depends on symptom presentation throughout life). Adults with ADHD may change jobs regularly, never quite finding fulfillment in a specific position. These individuals may not have any particular career aspirations and rarely receive career-related accolades. Other work or school-related signs of adult ADHD may include:difficulty finishing tasks problems maintaining focus or concentration forgetfulness (e.g. meetings, deadlines, etc.) disorganization procrastination tardiness  , Adults with ADHD frequently have co-morbid diagnoses of other mental disorders such as depression or anxiety. Adults with ADHD may demonstrate low frustration tolerance, meaning the slightest mistake or criticism can greatly impact their emotional stability.Such adults might easily blow up at others or sink into a depressive state. Adults with ADHD may also self-medicate their mood disturbances using alcohol or drugs, making substance abuse another common co-morbid problem.  Many people experience problems in their relationships that might resemble those who suffer from ADHD. However, adults with ADHD may encounter these issues to a greater extent.   Parents, siblings, friends, or partners may feel ignored or undervalued due to your constant talking over them, forgetting important engagements, and becoming easily bored in conversation. Plus, adults may exhibit impulsivity that results in them making poor decisions such as cheating, gambling, or abusing drugs or alcohol that interferes with their relationships., Keep in mind that any test completed online without the guidance of a health care provider can only provide tentative results. You will need to see a trained professional who can interview you and look at your symptoms in relation to your medical and academic history.  Explain to your doctor that you are concerned that you may be experiencing symptoms similar to ADHD and would like to be examined. If you think you might not know what to say when you get there, write down on a piece of paper your areas of concerns.   Your doctor may be able to diagnose ADHD based on previous experience with the disorder. However, most physicians will refer you for further assessment with a psychologist or psychiatrist.  In order to be sure you have ADHD and not some other problem, you must get a range of tests to rule-out other conditions. Tests must include a blood test to rule out thyroid problems, lead poisoning or hypoglycemia.If you want a thorough diagnosis also have a hearing and vision test, a brain scan and an EEG. These tests help rule out other possible problems that may seem to be ADHD.  Answer these questions as honestly and fully as you can. Bring copies of school reports or letters of when you were suspended or expelled, sent to court, traffic violations and so on as examples of problem areas.In some cases, in addition to self-report questionnaires, you might also be requested to complete a battery of psychological assessments. Such tests are designed to comprehensively examine your symptoms, personality, and any other co-existing conditions you might have.  These people might be your parents, spouse or teacher who can give a report on the areas you are struggling with. If this is not available they can fill out a questionnaire given by the doctor., There are effective treatments for children, teens, and adults who are diagnosed with ADHD. Many people attempt to relieve ADHD symptoms with natural remedies such as lifestyle changes (i.e. diet, sleep, exercise), developing routines, school or work accommodation and keeping distractions to a minimum. Research demonstrates that both children and adults show better results when they receive a combination of medication and therapy to treat ADHD.Always discuss any treatment approaches with your doctor before starting a new regimen or stopping an existing one.  

be aware of the probable causes of adhd.  search for a cluster of symptoms that indicate adhd.  understand the different subtypes of adhd.  figure out if problems at work or school point to a bigger problem.  see if emotional issues are suggestive of adult adhd.  take a closer look at your relationship difficulties.  take an online quiz.psychcentral is one website that provides a preliminary assessment that helps you determine if the problems your are experiencing are suggestive of an attention disorder.  visit your primary care physician.  have a full medical check up.  expect to answer questions about your life and symptoms.  have the psychologist interview others close to you.  talk to your health care team about treatment options. 

 When delivering your intent, back your vision of the desired outcome or future state of affairs by painting a vivid picture and describing the desired outcome, the better future, or whatever it is that is hoped for. Do this with passion, the passion that you yourself feel for the matter at hand. If you truly believe in what you're doing and why you lead others, then your passion will shine forth. Share your plans freely with those you're leading to help them see why you believe so much in your dreams and why buying into your dreams is a good idea for them too.        Be actively enthusiastic so that others can absorb your enthusiasm.      ; , People are more likely to follow a leader who is willing to share his or her vision, ideas and plans and who asks for buy-in. Even if those you're leading ultimately expect you to make the hard decisions, having them feel they've shared their ideas and thoughts will allow them to feel a sense of ownership in what you're striving for.   Be collaborative, not authoritarian. One of the best ways to further your inspiration is to include and encourage others around you to join you in the charge. Washington always kept an open mind to a variety of ideas and kept in mind that it often takes a collaborative effort to achieve greatness (for example, he knew that having the French Navy on his side helped defeat the British). By accepting that other people's ideas may have merit, you will always be able to take advantage of the brilliance of others, and not become persuaded that only you have all the answers!        , Rather than simply issuing orders or expecting others to fall in line, challenge people to rise to their best for any occasion. Seek the best they can do for the task at hand by actively noticing and remarking on their talents and good efforts. What you notice and praise, you tend to get more of.   Washington never believed that he was the fount of all knowledge. He relied on and trusted others to fill in his many gaps in knowledge, including Franklin, Mason, Henry, Jefferson, Hamilton and Madison. He wasn't intellectually dependent on others; rather, he was open minded and was willing to listen and learn from others too.  Making light of hard times or hoping they'll soon pass won't make the situation any easier. Facing the difficulties as they arise and finding strategies for coping and working through them is an important role for you as a leader. Moreover, imparting what you're doing is as important as doing it. Share your vision of how you expect you/your organization/your team/your family, etc., will survive a hard time you're facing. Washington was able to rally the troops despite failing morale precisely because he had a vision that he refused to let go of and that he was willing to share with others. The way in which he imparted this vision helped the troops to see beyond the paycheck––they became part of the revolution. Think of how you can paint the positive vision for the bad times so that you can engage people to think in a more positive, upbeat way and be inspired by your vision of the revolution too.       There is no point sugarcoating the bad that is occurring––everyone can see it happening with their own eyes. Never make decisions that result in rumors and uncertainty, such as whispers of lay-offs or big changes. Engage those you lead directly and tell them the truth about what is happening and why change is needed, and exactly how you're going about making the change. As soon as you know how others are impacted, inform them rather than leaving them guessing.  Be a man or woman of your word. Actually follow through with your promises or be courageous enough to explain yourself in those rare instances where you don't feel able to meet a promise you've made. In a society where fast and loose business is commonplace, being a man or woman of your word will provide you with more integrity and credibility. When people know that they can rely on you, they will be happier to follow and trust you.   Don’t make a promise you can’t deliver. There’s a reason why George Washington was the only American President to be elected by unanimous vote. His fellow politicians knew that when Washington made a promise or a statement, he would always deliver.  Being a leader means that you have to make tough decisions often. What may be healthy, safe or right from an objective standpoint for your company, community or family, may not be the most popular decision with those you're leading. However, sticking to what you objectively discern to be the "greater good" will end up being beneficial in the long run. However, be very careful about how you reach an idea of what is "good" for those you're leading––keep an open mind, constantly update your information (revising where needed) and always listen to others (including those who hold opposing opinions), so as to avoid becoming obsessed with your own version of what is apparently "good".   Before making a possibly unpopular decision, make sure it will be able to stand the test of time. Author Mark McNeilly, who penned “George Washington and the Art of Business,” wrote that Washington “always put the country first. People could trust him to stand above the politics, stand above the fray, and keep the interests of the country in mind.” Check and double check your decisions to ensure that you aren’t pandering to specific individual interests or making a decision that will not be better for everyone in the long run.       While listening to dissent is an important part of being a democratic leader, not all dissenters have a good point. This is not something to be afraid of––instead, recognize that some people are simply vexatious, difficult or personally invested in a particular outcome that doesn't benefit others. You still have a duty to carefully assess dissent but you also have the responsibility to dismiss dissent that is frivolous, cantankerous and trouble-making. That can be harder than it sounds!        , If you are too afraid to make an error or a mistake, you're likely to remain where you are now. Risking embarrassment and failure are a part of being human, and learning and honing your skills is often built on trial and error, through getting on with the task and doing it.   Apply lessons from each endeavor toward the next. Scholars believe that Washington’s Battle of Yorktown victory may have been built on the learning he gained from assessing his previous defeats. Stay in the present rather than obsessing about the past––take only a few minutes to lick your wounds and then stand up and learn from your error.  In today’s highly vocal 24/7 information-charged age, listening to the chatter and information may be one of the smartest strategic methods in order to effectively lead. However, be discerning about what chatter you choose to listen to––only listen when the chatter is insightful, constructive and learned. The chatter of gossip, rumor and character assassination is never helpful for anyone, let alone someone seeking to lead.   Be aware of your environment. Situational awareness and knowing your audience's preferences will help you size up the competition, any possible threats and all of the opportunities.  Perhaps you may not completely agree with an idea being shared by the competition or a colleague, but instead of turning a blind eye, listen and absorb what is being said. In fact, seek to stand in another person's shoes and learn their side of the story so well that you could discuss their beliefs, preference or approach to their satisfaction, even though you don't hold the same view. This is possibly one of the most successful means for reaching compromise and understanding with others because the other side realizes that you do totally understand their point of view, and that it is actually a case that you hold a different view.   Be curious about why the idea is being delivered, where it’s coming from and who is delivering it. Washington’s curiosity about the uncharted Virginia territory may have given him somewhat of a tactical advantage––he had explored the area and had prior knowledge before the battles commenced. Educate yourself. Whether you're college trained or life trained, you have a personal duty to never cease learning. Washington was not highly educated in the sense it is understood today––for example, he didn't go to college. But he didn't use this as an excuse to not learn or to be ignorant––he spent his whole life continually learning from his experiences, from his colleagues and through reading.  Washington, while beloved, turned down running for a third term because he felt it was time to pass the baton and disbursement of power. While he could have enjoyed a third term and the people were rallying for it, he knew that the country would be better off with new, fresh leadership. Remember that you are human, and that like all humans, you are fallible and there will come a time when your wisdom is best imparted through other channels and you should pass the baton to a new leader in the wings. Never overstay your welcome as a leader––there may be new and different leadership challenges awaiting you, or it may be time to pass to being a teacher, mentor or guide for future leaders. 

be an inspiration to others and yourself.  encourage idea exchange and relationship building.  expect a lot from those you lead.  face challenging or turbulent times head on.  follow through with your promises.  make decisions rooted in principles, not based on whether the decision will be a popular decision or not.  learn from your mistakes and be humble during triumph.  do more listening than talking.  be curious about new ideas, thoughts and concepts.  give others a chance. 

,, The best way to get to develop your cool while wearing Google Glass is to get your own. This'll give you the maximum opportunities to develop your cool look. After all, you'll be an owner, and not just a borrower of Glass!   As of January 2015, Google has stopped producing the Google Glass prototype. However, they have announced their continued dedication to developing the product beyond this experimental phase.If you can't get your hands on a new or second-hand Google Glass now, you'll have to settle for borrowing a pair from someone else.  Start thinking about how you are going to approach an unsuspecting person who has Google Glass so that you can try on their pair.   Read up on how to talk to strangers. It can be unnerving to have stranger walk up to you on the street, so try to approach the task from the shoes of the person you're approaching. Keep calm, stay friendly, and do everything you can not to put them off.  Search the local area for any Google Glass owners that might be nearby.   Tweet out to the hashtag #GoogleGlass that you want to try a pair and where you are located. Attend a technology workshop and see if one of the attendees or presenters have a pair you can use.  Remember to maintain welcoming body language so you can get a chance at that Google Glass!   If all else fails and you can't design a confident approach, be like Nike and "Just Do It!" if you see someone nearby who has a pair, approach them excitedly and ask to try on their Glass.  If they say no or they're in a hurry, be respectful and friendly, and walk away. If you can't find anyone to borrow a pair from, don't despair; just keep your eyes open for a good opportunity in the future. With Google planning to develop Glass more, chances are good you'll come across an owner sooner or later.   If none of the options above work, return to part one and investigate just buying your own pair.  Be sure to project your utmost confidence when you exclaim, "OK, Glass" while nodding your head slightly to the ceiling to active it.  For a simple example, think about the "'Sup?!" head nod that was popular in the '90s.   For more practice check out this detailed list of various head nods that you could try to up your "coolness" look. Be sure to choose the type of nod that best fits your personality.  You can always choose to forgo any air of confidence and go for the crazy cross eyed look that many people have when first using glass. This looks a little bit like you are having a seizure while trying to talk to an invisible friend. It's not the coolest approach but you can rely on the fact that you are wearing Google Glass to up your coolness factor.  For an extra coolness rating read up on simple Google Glass commands ahead of time. Then you can project stellar confidence when using them once you get a chance to try them on!  , That way, you can prove your coolness to others.  If you are lucky enough to get Google Glass to activate with your chosen head nod style, be sure to take a picture with Google Glass and send it to a friend for proof that you were wearing them and activated them on your own.  See if maybe it is worth the money after all!  

read about and understand the basics of google glass.  visit the #googleglass and #googleglassgram hashtags in twitter so you can see what other glass users are doing with glass.  ,  invest in your own if possible.  brainstorm potential approach tactics.  hunt for your target.  approach the owner if you find one.  keep your cool.  remember that google glass demands coolness when you are wearing them.  practice ahead of time by following some nods.  enjoy the moment!,  be prepared with commands.  have someone take a photo of you.  get proof from within glass itself.  read part one again. 

 The sorts of problems you might face can include:   Time - lack of Ego clashes Professional rivalry (if both of you are working in the same company or field) Jealousy and suspicion Not respecting each others individual space and identity Resistance from the family.; , Small things matter a lot in a relationship, and 'care' and 'love' matter a great deal. Make your beloved feel special. Saying the magical words all the time does not really prove that you care or love. It is the small things that you do in times of need that makes him/her feel that you are the one who is going to be there forever.   Girls love security, compassion and want someone who would be able to protect them and stand up for them in need. On the other hand, boys want a partner who is a reflection of their self, would understand them, stand by them and care for him and the family. The love that you feel needs to be shown as this is a very crucial factor in turning a relationship into a marriage.  Don't smother one another but show that you are able to thrive on a balance of time spent together and time spent apart.   Maintain each other's independence as well as being a couple.  Mental compatibility plays an important role in turning an ongoing relation into a marriage.   Know each other's likes and dislikes. Keep your professional and personal lives separate.  Don't take the message to create space to the other extreme and never have time for one another. Everything in moderation.   Try to adjust to each other's needs for space and togetherness.    Respect each other's beliefs and thoughts. Don't try to change your partner according to your values. Respect each other's family values. Maintain each other's individual identities.  

face the problems that can beset your relationship as it grows.  care about the small things.  understand each other's individual needs and the importance of space.  share each others' problems.  devote enough time to one another.  avoid being dominating. 

 Torrents are a way to share files between computers. You can download all kinds of programs and media using torrents. Downloading Sims 3 if you do not own it is illegal, and this method should only be followed if your discs have been lost or damaged.   The most popular torrent clients are uTorrent, Vuze, and BitTorrent.  In order to download torrents, you will need to find a torrent tracker. Public trackers will have most popular games, so you shouldn't have difficulties Googling one. Simply enter "sims 3 torrent" into the Google search.   When you are looking at a torrent tracker page, you will see a Seeders (S) and Leechers (L) column. The more seeders there are, the stronger your connection will be and the faster you will get the file. If there are significantly more leechers than seeders, the file may take a while to download. Read the comments for the torrent. This will help you determine if it contains any viruses, as torrents are a popular way to spread them.  After you find the torrent you want, click the download link to load it in your torrent client. After it connects to other people, the download will begin. Depending on the speed of your connection and the strength of the torrent, the download could take a significant amount of time.   The Sims 3 download is about 5 GB.  Games downloaded through torrents often install slightly differently than games purchased legitimately. Read the README file that should accompany most torrents for exact instructions for installing the game and applying the crack.   The crack will allow you to play the game without entering your CD key. This is useful if you've forgotten or lost your key, but is illegal if you do not own the game. Many games will come in ISO format, which is a disc image. It will need to either be mounted or burned in order to use it.  

download a torrent client.  find the torrent for the sims 3.  wait for the torrent to download.  install the game. 

 Even if the internet is your chosen method of contact, you may know this person from real life. They might be someone from your school or office, a neighbor, a friend of a friend. Whoever they are, getting to know them in real life can give you a rough idea of whether they are your type and what they like to do.   Take advantage of your common acquaintances. For example, if you know some of their friends, hang out with them more often when they're in their company. Getting to know their friends will help you realize what kind of people your potential date likes having around. If you barely know your date or any of their friends, even the most casual approach would do. For example, you can exchange a couple of jokes with your neighbor as you pass by their house to get a sense of what they're like.; , Once you've established even a very shallow level of connection, you can take a step forward and request their friendship on a social network you both use, like Facebook. Because you've already made acquaintance with this person in real life, you won't look like a weirdo invading their private life. Social-network users tend to accept any request as long as they have a loose connection with the person.   You can use Skype or other instant messaging services instead. However, remember that social networks are by far the best way to go, because they are designed to help people socialize. Instead, messaging applications are meant to help people communicate: this will give away your long-term goal, which is approaching this person with a specific request. You can go ahead and friend someone on a messaging application if you feel confident enough. As you add them to your contact list, they'll probably understand what your intentions are, so make sure you're okay with it. If you've met your potential date on a dating website, it's better to ask their permission before sending a friend request. For example, you can message them on the dating website and ask "Are you on Facebook"? If they say they are, take it as a "go ahead, you can friend me".  Once your friendship request has been accepted, you have access to a huge amount of useful information. Is this person already in a relationship? What do they enjoy doing in their spare time? What music do they listen to? What is their family like? Do you have common friends you didn't know of? This information will help you come up with a strategy to approach your potential date. Begin thinking of stuff you can do together. Or, you can start a conversation by mentioning a common friend. Picture yourself as a detective piecing up clues that can help you find a solution to the problem. Doing some background research will also help you not waste time with someone who might be too different from you. If you see that the cute guy in your French class only likes football when you hate sports and want to spend the rest of your life on the couch, you should ask yourself whether it's not even worth bothering. This is especially useful if your potential date lives in another town and you don't have a chance to hang out with them in person. Checking the conversation and posts on their Facebook page will be like spending time with them and their friends in the virtual world.  Do it shortly after your friend request has been accepted. If you wait too long, your potential date might think you've stalked them online. They will expect to have a casual chat with you once you've become friends on a social network.   Don't overthink how to start this. Just write "Hi! What's up? I'm glad I found you online!", or "Hi! Remember we met last week at Dave's party?" If you think they can't place you, remind them of how they know you (for example, which office you work in).  Unlike social networks, which work as a public space where friends and strangers exchange ideas, an e-mail address is considered private information, like a house address. You wouldn't want anyone knocking at your door if you haven't told them where you live, so don't write an e-mail unless you've asked this person their address beforehand.You shouldn't use the e-mail even if you have a way to retrieve this person's address (for example, through a common friend or website). Getting their address though a third source will also be perceived as an invasion of their privacy and highly decrease your chance to succeed.  As you do your best to build an exchange based on what you have in common, no matter how little, make sure you come off as a positive person who is just looking for a casual chat.   Don't overwhelm your potential date with emoticons or excessive internet slang (like LOL): this can be read as a sign of insecurity. There's no need to underline the fact you've said something funny with a hundred laughing faces. If the conversation ends up being about something bleak, like the tons of washing you have to do, cheer it up with some humor and jokes. For example, "You won't believe how much washing I have to do over the weekend. I wish my butler wasn't on leave." Don't overburden the person with too much information. You don't want to do all the talking at this stage.  Whatever you say, make sure you're not performing someone else's role. You want your potential date to get a sense of who you are and understand whether they'd like to know you better. If you're not a funny person, don't try to be; if you're the life of the party, acting serious may not be in your nature.   Keep in mind that sounding "at your best" shouldn't turn into "sounding phony". Convey the sides of your personality you want the other person to know about without overdoing it, and don't fake any you don't have. For example, if you're funny, make a light joke. If you're insightful, make a deep but quick remark about something. Overacting can happen especially for online dating. This can make dating feel like a job interview where you have to advertise your skills. However, remember that online dating is about matching people: the more you're yourself, the more you'll be matched with someone who is like you and you have a better chance with.  It's easy to idealize someone when they're little more than a picture and profile page. However, this person exists in real life, and they're probably way more complex than what the screen gives away.   As the conversation goes on, try to think of what this person is really like, rather than the image they're giving of themselves. Compare the idea you had of this person before the conversation (for example, "she's so cool") with what you can sense from your virtual chat (for example, "she's trying very hard to look cool, so she probably isn't", or "she's actually as cool as I expected").Pay extra attention to this aspect when talking to someone you met through an online dating website. They might pretend to be someone they're not just to make an impression; it happens more than you think.  There's no point in turning the casual chat into a two-hour online date. Your goal is to ask your potential date out to do most of the talking and get to know them in person. This conversation is only an introduction to that special request.   If you make yourself too available in the virtual world, the other person might lose an interest in meeting you in real life.  Once you've warmed up and feel it's not an awkward thing to do, drop a casual request. If you feel it's still too early to ask for a date but you've spent longer than expected on the chat, or had several online conversations, a phone number is the safe next step to take to get closer to this person.For example, you can use an excuse. Say "I have to go back to work now, but I really enjoyed talking to you. Do you have a phone number so that we can continue our chat later?"  , Use the research you've done before the conversation to suggest an activity you might enjoy doing together. For example, if you both like foreign films, find one playing next to you and invite them. Present your suggestion as a way to continue the very interesting chat you're having elsewhere.For example, you can say "I really like talking to you. Why don't we continue our chat at the Mexican restaurant near school next weekend?" Although this is the hardest part, think of your request as a step that will relieve the tension in the conversation. It will give both the chance to do something together where you can actually get to know each other for what you really are., If your request was not within the conversation, but a message on Skype or WhatsApp following a few previous conversations, don't expect this person to reply straight away. They may want to take their time to think this through, which doesn't mean they don't like you.   Making pressure to get a reply won't work to your advantage. Unlike real-life conversations, online chats and messages give a person more time to plan a response or strategy. This is why you probably chose them for your approach, and you should give this person the same level of liberty you've taken for yourself. If it's taking too long for someone to reply (for example, a few days), or they're putting you off on a regular basis, they're probably not interested. Accept this without becoming insistent or expecting them to say "no" loud and clear., If the answer is "no", whatever form it takes, life goes on as before. No need to despair or get pushy. There are many other people you'll meet in the future who will take a real interest in you!Most importantly, remember to not take it personally or think you should have sounded different. You are supposed to be yourself online, not play a role. And if this person wasn't into you, it wouldn't have lasted anyway. 

hang out with the person you like or their friends.  friend them on a social network.  find out more about your potential date's relationship status and interests.  start an online conversation.  e-mail your potential date only if they've personally given you their address.  keep the conversation light and upbeat.  act natural.  remember that people behave differently online than they do in person.  keep online exchanges brief.  ask for their phone number.  ask them out on a date.  give them time to respond.  be prepared for rejection. 

 Your contract is your legal agreement which you must abide by. If you fail to uphold your end of the bargain, then the other party can sue you in court and get money damages.Accordingly, you must follow your obligations in the lease agreement.   Before you can do anything, you should find your copy of the lease. Make sure it is the most recent. If you have had a long-term relationship with the tenant or facility, then you might have multiple contracts.; , These provisions will explain how either party can end the lease before the expiration date and the circumstances in which they can terminate the lease. In a long-term contract, there are probably several situations in which either side can end the relationship:The sporting facility was destroyed by natural disasters. If a fire or tornado destroyed the facility, then the tenant is usually given the right to terminate the contract. The facility is condemned by the government. In this situation, the tenant can terminate the contract. One side pays “liquidated damages.” These damages are also called an “early termination fee.” You can usually end a long-term contract early by paying a lump-sum of money to the other side. Either side “defaults” on its obligations. Both landlords and tenants have obligations, which are called “covenants” or “agreements” in the lease. A tenant, for example, agrees to pay rent on a regular schedule. If either party fails to uphold its obligations, then the other party can usually terminate after a certain amount of time.  Not all sporting facility contracts are long-term. For example, you might have rented out an auditorium in order to host a two-day expo. However, if your plans change, then you might need to cancel the event. A short-term contract should have a cancellation provision.   Cancellation provisions can be pretty strict. For example, the contract might state that you have no right to a refund if you don’t cancel early enough., You should meet with an attorney to discuss your options for ending the contract before the expiration date. Your goal should be to end the contract without inviting a lawsuit. Your lawyer can help you find ways to do that.   If you own a sports team or a facility, then you should have a lawyer as general counsel. Call him or her and schedule a meeting. The lawyer can read the contract and come up with a strategy for making a clean break from the contract. If you don’t have a lawyer, then get referrals from other teams or facility owners in your area. They might have tried to end a sporting facility contract recently and can give you the name of their lawyer.Call the lawyer up and explain your problem. You can then schedule a longer consultation.  You might not want to pay liquidated damages to end the contract early. Instead, your ideal resolution might be to end the contract without having to pay any money. In this situation, you will have to find a promise the other side has not fulfilled, which is called a “breach.” Go through the contract cover to cover and identify every promise the other side has made.   For example, the stadium owner probably promises to fix hazards and not to interfere with the tenant’s enjoyment of the property. Failure to fulfill these obligations qualifies as a “breach” of the contract, which can justify termination. The tenant also makes many promises, such as promising to make rent on schedule and to use the facility for only authorized purposes. If the tenant fails to fulfill these obligations, then it has also breached the contract., Before you can end the contract, you need solid evidence that you have a reason for doing so. This means getting evidence that the other side isn’t fulfilling its obligations under the lease agreement. Gather relevant evidence:   Hold onto communications with the other side. For example, you might have sent notices that rent is due. Keep copies of these notices, as well as anything the tenant sent in return. Take photographs. The landlord might have refused to fix a hazard. You should take photographs of the hazard to serve as proof. Save newspaper clippings. The tenant might have used the facility for an unauthorized purpose. Hold onto any newspaper clippings which discuss the event.  You need to put the other side on notice of how it is not fulfilling its contractual obligations. You can do this by sending a breach of contract notice. Format the notice like a standard business letter.   Be sure to include the date near the top of the letter. The date is important.If your contract states that the other side has 30 days to fix a problem, then the date on your letter starts the clock.  Quote provisions from the lease agreement that the other side has not fulfilled. For example, if the tenant has not paid rent, then quote the rent payment provision.   List every breach you can find. Start with the most serious violation and then move down to less serious ones., Here is where things can be difficult. You may want to get out of the contract immediately. However, the lease probably states that the party in breach has a chance to “cure” or fix the violation.Your contract might not let you terminate the lease until 30 days have passed and the other side has made no effort to cure.You should talk with your lawyer about how you want to handle this. If you agreed to give the other side a chance to cure, you are legally bound to that agreement. The other side might quickly fix the problem so that the contract can continue in force. A good way to think about the breach of contract notice is that it is an opening move in the negotiation process. You can state, “Please contact me to discuss how to resolve these issues.”  , Your lease probably states where you should send the notice. Make sure to send it to the correct address and use the method identified in the lease for delivery.If you fail to use the agreed delivery method, then the other side could claim that it hasn’t received proper notice and therefore doesn’t need to fix the problems.   If you mail the letter, then send it certified mail, return receipt requested. Always hold onto a copy of all communications with the other side.  Negotiating a settlement would allow you to avoid going to trial, which will be more expensive than negotiations.A settlement also provides closure. You could end the contract and then move on. You should only negotiate if you are willing to compromise to reach a resolution.   You shouldn’t negotiate if you are unwilling to compromise. Negotiations will only be successful if you approach them with an open mind and in good faith. If you really don’t want to negotiate, then you should either pay liquidated damages to end the contract early or wait to be sued and defend yourself at trial.  You need a goal before going into negotiations. For example, if you are the tenant, then your goal might be to get out of the lease and not have to pay anything. This can be your ideal resolution.   To figure out how aggressive you can be during negotiations, you should consider your best alternative to a negotiated agreement. Depending on your evidence, for example, your best alternative could be to pay liquidated damages (if your evidence is weak) or win a lawsuit (if your evidence is strong). The attractiveness of your best alternative can help you decide how aggressive to be in negotiations. You also need to know the absolute minimum you are willing to settle for. For example, you might be willing to settle by paying 33% of what remains on your sports facility contract. This is called your “walkaway” point.If the other side can’t meet it, then you stop negotiating.  Negotiations will probably take place at a lawyer’s office. You should let your attorney handle most of the discussions, but be sure to offer your input. Your lawyer can’t accept a settlement offer without your approval, so stay engaged.Don’t expect to finish negotiations all in one meeting. You should continue to meet as long as you feel that you are making progress.  If you reach an agreement, your lawyers will draft a settlement agreement for each party to sign. The settlement agreement is a new contract between the two parties. If either of you violate it, then you could be sued.   For example, the tenant might agree to pay some money to the landlord. If the tenant refuses, the landlord can go into court with the settlement agreement and sue. If both parties agree to end the contract, then you will sign a “mutual rescission agreement.” This agreement will formally end your relationship., If negotiations fail, then you can simply stop performing under the contract. For example, a tenant could move out and stop paying rent. You would then wait for the landlord to sue you for breach of contract. Your lawyer will help you build your defense for the lawsuit.   Lawsuits can be drawn-out and time-consuming. In particular, lawsuits involve a fact-finding phase called “discovery.” In discovery, you and the other side can request documents from each other and ask each other questions under oath.The discovery phase can often last up to a year. At the trial, each side will present evidence that justifies its actions. If you are trying to end the contract, then you will try to prove that the other side breached the contract first. In effect, you will try to prove that what you stated in your breach of contract notice is true. If you lose at trial, you generally have the ability to bring an appeal.  

find your sporting facility contract.  read the termination provisions in a long-term lease.  find the cancellation provision in a short-term contract.  consult with a lawyer.  identify a breach of the sporting facility contract.  gather proof of the breach.  format the breach of contract notice.  identify the other side’s breach of the lease.  tell the other side how to fix the problem.  mail the notice to the correct address.  analyze whether negotiation is ideal.  talk about your negotiations strategy with your lawyer.  meet to negotiate with the other side.  draft a settlement agreement.  wait to be sued. 

 Depending on the type of biological control that you use, you may need to get a permit from your local department of wildlife or agriculture. Some species that can control lake weeds are considered invasive in particular areas, and you may not be allowed to introduce them. Always learn what your local laws are before introducing a new animal or fish into your lake., Mute swans can be released onto small lakes. As they feed on both submerged plants and algae, they may be ideal to control vegetation. Keep in mind that swans require extra care, husbandry, and protection from predators., Also known as the white amur, grass carp feed on the submersed plants in your lake. They are usually introduced into a lake to control vegetation. Keep in mind that grass carp will eat almost any submerged vegetation, not just invasive species or weeds.  Grass carp will not help much with duckweed or watermeal. It is recommended that you stock 15 to 30 fish per acre of lake. Get carp that are at least ten or twelve inches long.Grass carp can be invasive. Check your local laws to make sure that you are allowed to use them as a biological control before you release them into your lake.  If you want to target a specific weed, you may look into using insects as form of biological control. You will need to find insects that are host-specific; this means you pick a species of insects that will only eat the specific weed that you want to remove. You can research your particular weed to see if there is an insect species that may help. You might also reach out to your local department of wildlife or agriculture, Noxious Weed Control Board, or an ecologist.Do not release non-native insects until you have verified that they will only eat the plant in question and that they will have no other impact on your local ecosystem.  

check your local laws.  introduce swans to the lake.  release grass carp into the lake.  research which insects may be helpful.

 The shaft of a boot refers to the portion of the boot that rises above your foot and over your calf.   When you only see a measurement for “boot shaft,” it is safe to assume that the measurement refers to the height of the shaft and not the circumference.; , Place one end of a tape measure at the middle of the boot arch, directly above the boot sole. Extend the tape measure vertically along the outside of the boot until you reach the very top of the shaft. This length is your boot shaft height.Note that in the United States, boot shaft sizes are described in inches even when the shaft extends beyond a foot in height. When a manufacturer lists the shaft height of a boot, the heel height is not usually included in that measurement. There is still some risk that some shops will include heel height as part of the shaft height, though, which can throw this measurement off completely. When buying a pair of boots you cannot measure yourself, try to verify whether or not heel height is left out of the shaft measurement.  If you are not able to measure the boot, you can estimate how tall a boot shaft might be simply by noting the style of boot.   For a size 8.5 women's boot:Ankle boot shafts range between 3 and 8 inches (7.6 and 20.3 cm). Mid-calf boot shafts range between 8.25 and 13.25 inches (21 and 33.7 cm). Knee-high boot shafts can be 13.5 inches (34.3 cm) or taller.   Boot shaft estimations can vary depending on the size of the boot. A size smaller than 8.5 will have a slightly shorter shaft, while a larger size will have a slightly larger shaft. The change in shaft size is usually about equal to the change in foot length when you compare your size against an 8.5 sized boot.  Typically, heel height is not included as part of the boot shaft height. Since this separate measurement does play a part in the overall height of the boot, though, it can still be worth knowing.   Measure the heel height by extending a tape measure from the bottom of the heel to the point at which it meets the sole of the boot. Place the tape measure against the center side of the heel as you measure. Common heel heights based on heel type are:  Flat heels, with an average height between 0 and 0.75 inches (0 and 1.9 cm). Low heels, with an average height between 1 and 1.75 inches (2.5 and 4.4 cm). Mid heels, with an average height between 2 and 2.75 inches (5 and 7 cm). High heels, with an average height at 3 inches (7.6 cm) or above.    

identify the boot shaft.  measure from the arch to the top of the shaft.  know a few common measurements.  also consider heel height. 

 The beads should all be of a similar size but they can be varied shapes. Choose crystal, pearl, plain, cylinder, faceted and round, to provide pretty variety. They must have threading holes in them, and the hole must be large enough to accept a pipe cleaner being pushed through.; , To begin with, you'll need to develop the pattern for the beads you're using. This pattern will go along each stem and looks best when it is reflect symmetrically on each of the snowflake's stems. Hence, making a template makes it easy for you to follow for every snowflake stem per snowflake decoration being made.   For example, you could make a pattern that goes: One round crystal bead, one pearl bead, one cylinder bead, one round bead, repeat. Or, any other variation that pleases you. The important thing is to mix up pearl, crystal and plain to give the impression of "glittering". Consider using a few larger beads around the center of the snowflake, allowing you to show off some very special beads and create the impression of a typical snowflake with a larger center which descends into smaller tips.  That way, the design can be referred to again and again and if it's accidentally bumped, it'll stay in place.    Align the pipe cleaners in a row on a flat surface. Twist the pipe cleaners around the middle two to three times to join them together. Pull the untwisted lengths apart. Spread them out by their tips to form a 6-pointed star or snowflake shape, with all the sections evenly placed apart from each other.  Following the order you've chosen for the beads (see Part 1 above), begin to thread the beads onto the snowflake. If you're using larger beads around the center, obviously these are the ones to start with. Push the beads all the way to the twisted join in the middle, right up the stem. , This will prevent the last bead (and any other beads) from slipping off. The furriness of the pipe cleaner will also assist in keeping the beads snugly in place. Allow the glue to dry fully.  Use the invisible thread or monofilament and cut as long a hanging length as needed for your tree, window or other hanging location. Tie one end to one tip of the snowflake and knot tightly. Cut off any excess from the knot. Tie the other end in a loop for hanging over a cup hook, tree branch or pinning into wood, etc.  A whole tree covered in these looks stunning. They also make nice gifts, especially if you include a "handmade by me" gift note.  

choose the beads.  arrange the beads you're using on a bead board or similar sorting item.  keep one line of the design stuck down on double-sided tape.  form a snowflake shape from the three pipe cleaners.  thread the beads on.  repeat for each stem of the snowflake being created.  ,  to finish each end, dab the glue on to form a solid stopper.  place a hanger on the completed snowflake decoration.  repeat as many times as you need snowflake ornaments. 

 The design doesn't have to be overly complicated; when working with negative and positive space, simplicity often works best.; , The background is the negative space, and the subject is the positive space. By colouring just one, you'll create stark contrast between the two, and change the effect of your piece.  Observe how the switched colors can change the overall impression of the drawing; to get the full effect, you can make two identical images with different colouring choices and display them together.  

draw a simple outline drawing with a pencil, pen or even in a computer art package.  decide if you want to colour the background or the subject.  colour your drawing. 

 As soon as you become aware that your friend is mad at you, you need to figure out what you said or did that caused him to get upset.You may already know, but if you do not, take time to reflect on your recent actions around and words to him. What did you say or do that might have upset him? If you cannot determine what made him angry with you, you will have to ask him. You cannot sincerely apologize for something that you did not know was wrong or upsetting.; , You could have done any number of things to upset your guy friend. An important step in giving a sincere apology is admitting to yourself that you made a mistake.   It can be a challenge to do this, because many people do not like admitting that they are wrong or that they did something wrong. However, this is a key component to giving a genuine apology and repairing your friendship.  Presumably, you know your guy friend pretty well. Another key aspect of apologizing to him involves knowing why this particular issue upset him.   Did you offend his values or beliefs? Did you hurt his feelings? Did you lie to him? Did you offend his family or another close friend? Did you physically hurt him?  , Generally speaking, in-person apologies are much preferred. However, if an in-person apology is not possible, the next best options are writing a personal letter or giving him a phone call.   Most people strongly recommend against sending an apology in a text message, because it seems insincere. You are sending the message to your friend that you do not have or do not want to take the time to apologize in person and that you do not value his friendship.  If you chose to apologize in-person, ask your guy friend if he will meet up with you to talk the next day. Otherwise, plan to write him a letter or wait a day before calling him.   It is best to give both of you time to calm down and take a step back from the situation. In some cases, apologizing immediately comes off as insincere  and selfish. However, you want to avoid waiting too long, because that will cause resentment to build.In the meantime, prepare your apology to your guy friend.  It is important to go into the apology prepared with what you will say. Typically, boys and men do not appreciate a lot “fluff;” rather, it is better to get right to the point.   “I need to apologize for what I did.” “I'm sorry for what I said the other day.” “I owe you an apology for the way I acted.” “I want to apologize to you about how I treated you.”  , Often, these simply come across as excuses for your behavior.If you really feel the need to give a reason for your actions, it is best to stick to reasons that put the blame on you. For example, “I said those mean things about you because I felt pressured to fit in with that crowd.” Avoid saying statements like, “Well, I know I shouldn't have said those things, but you brought it on yourself.”  , However, when you are apologizing, it is best to accept responsibility for your actions.   “I recognize that I was in the wrong.” “I know that what I did was rude, and you didn't deserve to be treated like that.” “I'm aware that I made a mistake.” “I made a mistake, and I fully accept that truth.”  , When you hurt a friend's feelings or somehow upset him, sometimes he loses trust in you. One way to rebuild that trust is to show him that you value the friendship and want to repair it.   “I'll buy you a replacement, since I ruined yours.” “I don't like that they tried to make me bully someone to be friends with them, so I'm going to stay away from them. I already have great friends, like you.” “I'll apologize to your family, as well. That was a really horrible thing of me to say.” “I will always be honest with you from now on. Your friendship means a lot to me.”  , Once you have drafted everything you want to say to him in your apology, carry it out.   Follow through with meeting him in person to apologize, or be sure to give him a call. If you chose to write him a letter, then leave it somewhere he will find it or mail it to him. Remember to not make excuses while you talk with him. Remain calm while giving your apology. Crying will likely make him feel guilty, when you are the one at fault, and getting angry will turn the conversation into an argument. Allow him to interrupt if he becomes upset or wants to say something, and do not react negatively if you do not like what he says. This shows him that you are serious and respect his friendship., In some cases, he might not be willing to accept your apology. It is important to accept this yourself.   Do not get mad at him, and do not yell at him. It is his right to accept or reject your apology, and if you really offended or hurt him, he might not want to do that. If your mistake has cost you your friendship, you need to take responsibility for that. Avoid begging for his forgiveness or asking him what you can do to make it up to him. Rather, take the initiative to regain his trust by doing those things on your own.  In your apology, you likely told him a way that you will make it up to him. Show him you were serious by following through with those promises.   Do whatever it takes to make it up to him without complaint. Complaining about it will only negate your apology and possibly put the guilt or blame on him. It is, quite possibly, even more important to follow through if he rejected your apology, because this is a big way that you will try to regain his trust.  Once the apology and the disagreement are over, it is best to let the whole situation fall into the past.   Do not bring it up over and over again, regardless of whether he accepted or rejected your apology. If he accepted it, then bringing it up will likely become annoying and cause a new issue. If he rejected it, then bothering him about it frequently will likely only push him further away.  

identify what happened to upset your guy friend.  recognize that you made a mistake.  understand why your mistake upset your friend.  decide how you will apologize to him.  make plans to apologize to your friend after he has had time to cool off.  plan out what you will say to him.  avoid giving reasons for why you did the action that upset your friend.  take full responsibility for your actions.in some cases, you and your friend might both be to blame for the disagreement.  explain how you will make it up to him.  apologize to your guy friend.  accept it if your guy friend rejects your apology.  show your guy friend that you mean your apology.  let the situation become history. 

 An electronic fitness tracker (usually in the form of a watch that you wear on your wrist) can be an excellent way to track your heart rate.

 A great way to begin building accountability at work is seeking feedback from the people you work with. Depending on what your job entails, specifically regarding your position in a hierarchy, you can seek feedback from those above you, those on your level, and those under you.Your job may already have specific performance standards in place which are reviewed periodically by supervisors, but you can show your boss that accountability is important to you by actively seeking extra feedback about your performance. You might seek feedback regarding a specific project or assignment you recently finished, or you might want get a general idea for how you are doing.; , It’s also good to seek feedback from the people you work with day to day, even when they have no power or authority over you. You need to know whether the people you work with can count on you or not.   Be sure to ask questions that are specific to get the feedback you desire. For example, you might say something like, "I worked really hard on that presentation, but I'd love some feedback on where I could improve. Do you have any input?"  , As a manager, or any upper level position, you don’t want to make all the decisions on your own and never ask how people feel you are leading. Approach subordinates in the right way so you don’t seem like you lack authority. Just be genuine and tell those below you that you want to know how they think you are doing at your job.   Try creating an anonymous survey that you can distribute to your employees. This may provide you with more honest feedback because they will be less likely to worry about the comments they make backfiring on them.  Asking your boss, peers, and subordinates for feedback on your performance is useless if you don’t take the feedback into consideration and find ways to implement it. Maybe you can’t do exactly what the critique entails, but you can use it as a springboard for making changes.  You may spend a lot of time working with a team, and the results are the culmination of everyone’s effort. In some settings, it may be possible to hide or be a little dishonest about the work you accomplished. Being accountable means fully owning up to whatever comes of your work.This is hardest when you have made a mistake or have not quite made the best of an opportunity you have been given. It may feel natural to shift the blame or make excuses that focus on outside forces, but being upfront and honest about your work is an important aspect of accountability. Owning up to shortcomings will show the people you work with and for that you are not trying to hide anything. When you do mess up, and you have to be honest with someone about the mistake, it is always good to have an idea or plan for how to remedy the situation. Being honest and owning the mistake is the first step, but there is most likely still something that needs to happen. Having a solution to the problem ready when you admit the mistake will help ease the tension and show that you are not giving up.  If you work in an office and you usually have your door open, try shutting it for a couple days. An open door invites people to stop and talk, even if it isn’t about work. Closing the door more often will give you the privacy to focus more on work and less on interacting with people., In a given day of work, you might have five or more things that need to get done. However, not all of the tasks have the same level of priority. Get in the practice of working on the most important things first and putting off the things that can wait., For less important tasks, force yourself to limit how long you spend on them. Don’t spend a whole hour clearing out spam email if someone is waiting for an email response from you. Knock out an important task that you know will take a while, and then balance it with a short, lower priority task. Alternating in this way can boost your efficiency.  At the end of the day, or periodically throughout the day, write down what you do and how long you spend doing it. You may be surprised where your time actually goes. It’s probably best not to show your boss this log, but it will help you see what is draining your time and you can work on reducing those time-wasters. 

seek feedback from your boss.  ask your peers how you are doing.  ask your subordinates how you can improve.  implement the feedback you receive.  be honest about the results of your work.  make time for solo work.  prioritize your tasks.  set specific time limits.  keep a time log of how you spend each day for a week.

 You need to be confident in your knowledge of and love for your partner in order to build a relationship that you can both believe in. Learn how to understand your partner, how to interpret what she says and pick out her emotional states. You should be able to tell when something's bothering her, and know what makes her feel better.  Ask each other questions. Ask about what your partner likes and dislikes, what she wants to do in the next year or five years, where she's been, who her friends are -- anything can spark a story and get a great conversation going. Turn this into a game by keeping track of how many questions you ask, and try to reach 1000 first.        Play games to get to know each other. To play Two Truths and a Lie, tell your partner two true things and one false thing about yourself, and have her guess which is the lie. Or make a quiz about yourself and send it to her. Have her do the same, and compete to get the most answers right.       Use multiple methods of communication. Talking on the phone is great for certain kinds of conversations. Email encourages more thoughtful discussions of weightier topics, while texting is great for a quick, light-hearted chat. Use more than one method of communication to get to know all sides of your partner.      ; , Discuss topics like what you want to get out of the relationship and where you see it going. Commit to the trust and communication that sustain a long-distance relationship. Understand the difficulties you will face and talk about them with your partner, but at the end of the day, if the relationship is going to work, you both need to fully dedicate yourselves to it, without hesitation.  Encourage your partner to trust you by always proving yourself worthy of her trust. Follow through on your promises, even the small ones like calling her at a specific time or responding to a message. If you ever find that you can't follow through on a promise, have a very good reason why, explain this to her, and ask for -- don't demand -- her forgiveness.  It's hard to believe in a relationship when you never talk to your partner, and it's hard to build a relationship when you don't know what's going on in your partner's life. Make sure you talk often so that you can participate in her life, and you can feel her presence in yours. Regular communication is the key to sustaining any relationship, but this is especially true for long-distance ones.  Honest and open communication is just as important as talking often. If something is worrying you, your partner should be the first to know. If she's feeling upset or frustrated, she should be comfortable opening up to you. If you are consistently open with your partner, she will learn to trust what you say and will feel more comfortable in the relationship. Be completely honest with your partner and trust that she will with you.  This will allow you to better understand your partner's daily life, and being friendly with the people in her life can help both of you feel more involved with each other. Her friends will also appreciate the chance to get to know the person taking up so much of her time and energy. This increased involvement with your partner will help you build trust in your relationship.  Although you may want to spend every moment of every day talking with her, recognize that she needs time and space to live her own life. Don't pressure her to give you more of her time and energy than she's comfortable with. Trust that she will come to you when she needs to, and allow her the space to be her own person within your relationship.   Finding the right balance between personal space and regular communication is perhaps the hardest part of a long-term relationship -- and the balance is different for every couple. Experiment and check in with each other regularly to see what works and what doesn't. Work together to find a balance that lets you both be as happy and as healthy as possible.  Discuss how you both feel about how your relationship is going. Talk about whether you feel happy, comfortable, and confident in the relationship, and what each of you could do to make it even better. If one of you feels dissatisfied for any reason, discuss the problem and work together to figure out a solution that you're both comfortable with. Recommit to your partner and the relationship, taking into account whatever changes, if any, you've discussed.   Regular check-ins give you a way to make changes to the relationship or even end with mutual understanding and without unnecessary pain, it if and when that becomes necessary. Though it may seem tedious, pessimistic, or even silly, long-distance relationships are a lot of work and this is a good way to make sure it's still working for both of you.  Your partner will likely do or say something that might confuse or alarm you. She might not return a call, or she might make a snide or offensive comment when talking to you. Don't jump to conclusions about her intentions when this happens -- assuming that she's hiding something or deliberately antagonizing you is a great way to insult her and damage your relationship. Instead, assume that there's a perfectly valid, reasonable explanation for whatever she did, and ask to her about it the next time you talk. Always assuming good intentions will foster trust and good feeling, and is crucial in sustaining a long-distance relationship.  This cannot be stressed enough. A long-distance relationship, even more so than any other relationship, is predicated on mutual trust, and accusing your partner of cheating, or even of wanting to cheat, destroys that trust on both sides of the relationship. Never assume that your partner has been unfaithful, and never confront him or her about it. If you are open with each other and committed to your relationship, she will confess any infidelity to you, and then you can deal with it in a healthy and positive way. If you accuse him or her, you introduce suspicion into both sides of the relationship, ultimately and irreparably damaging it.  As with any relationship, it's inevitable that you will at some point get annoyed or angry at each other. When this happens, address the conflict calmly. Discuss your disagreement. Make an effort to understand her side, and explain to him or her how you feel. Work together to come up with a solution, and make sure you're both happy with the resolution. Regard disagreements as an opportunity to build up your relationship, rather than something that could tear it apart.  Understand that a long-distance relationship is difficult for both of you and requires a lot of work and effort, when there are many other things you could be doing with that time and energy. If your partner is worth the sacrifice, you should be happy to make it. But don't let the relationship consume your life. You need time to devote to work, school, family, and your social life apart from your relationship. If it feels like you aren't able to give enough time to your other friends and activities, it may be time to work with your partner to reevaluate your relationship.  If the only thing you talk about is what you did that day, you're bound to get bored pretty fast, and this can quickly take the heat out of your relationship. Expand your conversations by asking questions, teaching your partner about something new you're learning, discussing books and movies you've enjoyed, or playing a game together.  Go on virtual dates. Watch a movie together online, play a MMORPG or other online game together, or eat the same meal while on the phone together. This can simulate the shared experience that you get from dating in-person, and this will help you build your conversations.       Take an online class together. This will stimulate conversation and challenge yourselves intellectually, which can add new energy to the relationship.       Go back to the beginning of your relationship, where you were just getting to know each other. Ask the same kinds of questions, and focus on learning new things about your partner. There will always be things about her that you don't know, and this can be a great way to renew your interest in the relationship.  Even if you can't see each other often, always have a place and date set for the next visit. This will give you both something to look forward to. It can guide your relationship and help you move forward together without necessarily entailing definite long-term plans. Make the most out of your visits, even if they are rare, and always be thinking about the next one.  

get to know your partner well.  commit to the relationship.  be reliable.  talk to your partner often.  be open with your partner.  get to know your partner's friends and family.  give your partner space.  check in with your partner regularly.  assume good intentions.  never accuse your partner of being unfaithful.  address disagreements calmly and rationally.  think about the sacrifice you're both making.  expand your conversations to keep them from getting boring.  plan your next visit. 

 Wet a cotton cloth with rubbing alcohol. Alternately, dip the cloth in a solution of ten parts denatured alcohol, eight parts water (distilled or deionized) and one part non-detergent household ammonia. Wipe the wet cloth over stains, grease or dirt build-up.         Perform this step on stubborn stains before proceeding to soak the item in soap and water. Ammonia can cause a chemical reaction to surfaces with unstable glazing. If in doubt, don’t use ammonia. Make sure to wear gloves!  , Dampen a cloth with acetone, De-Solv-it spray, or Goo Gone. Rub the moistened cloth on any areas with glue or sticker marks. Follow this up by buffing with a soft cloth.         Make sure to wear gloves. Don’t try this technique on any areas where your pottery has been repaired.  Put a bit of metal polish, such as Noxon, on a rag. Rub the moistened rag on the markings. Apply significant pressure as you rub. Buff the pottery clean with a dry part of the rag.         Alternately, try using “Barkeeper’s Friend” with warm water and a sponge, or use a pencil eraser.  Soak your pottery in white vinegar for at least a day or two. Rub the mineral buildup daily using a butter knife to gently break up buildup. Wash the pottery with soap and warm water once you’ve achieved clean pottery. Soak the pottery in tap water to get rid of the vinegar odor.         Try this for lime, calcium or rust stains.  Wet clean rags with 40% hydrogen peroxide. Wrap your pottery with the rags. Place the wrapped pottery in a sealed bag. Re-soak the rags every few days.         The process is complete when the crazing has lightened to your satisfaction.

 This trick is very simple, and relies on your charisma performing this trick. You’ll need a sugar cube, glass of water, and a pencil. Have your materials ready in front of you before performing the trick.   This trick works best on smaller children who won’t suspect what you’re doing.  Ask your audience for a number between 1 and 10. Once they give you a number, write the number into the sugar cube. Trace over the number several times with your pencil to make sure the number is bold., Pick up the sugar cube so that the side with the number is facing your thumb. Apply pressure so that the pencil mark transfers onto your thumb. Then, drop the sugar cube into the glass of water.   You will need to apply a lot of pressure, so push your thumb into the cube with force.  This is the most important part of the trick. Grab their hand with your thumb that you printed the number onto. Hold their hand so that your thumb is on their inner palm. Hold their hand for a few moments and say some magic words.   Say magic words to pass the time while you transfer the pencil onto their palm. Tell them to keep their palm over the glass of water for ten seconds.  Now tell them to show everyone their hand. They should have a faint image of the number on their inner palm. You should practice these steps with a trusted friend or family member before taking it out to the public.   This works best on little kids who won’t expect the allusion. 

prepare the supplies.  ask them for a number.  drop the number in the water with strategy.  move their hand over the water.  reveal the magic number. 

 The first step to predicting the future through dreams to is to remember them. Prophetic dreams, also called “precognitive dreams,” do not occur much, if at all, so you will have to be vigilant when it comes to remembering and reading your dreams. With effort, you can get better at holding onto the dreams, images, and symbols after waking.When you wake, hold the dream in your mind’s eye. This is when the dream is freshest and before your mind might unwittingly add to it. Try to recall the whole dream, include places, colors, emotions, and images. Each detail of the dream matters.Try to figure what where you were, what you were doing, who else appeared in your dream, and what was the interaction between you and others.Focus on these images rather than a narrative. Dreams are often just a series of images and not connected in a coherent way, and our mind later orders them.; , Putting down the dream in writing will help you to reinforce it in your memory. Start a notebook dedicated to your dreams, using it to record images and sequence whenever possible, improving your recall.Place the dream journal near your bed. That way, you can grab it immediately after waking up and record what you experienced. Having your dreams in a notebook will also be useful when you start your analysis. You will be able to compare dreams with those in the past, contrast symbols, and also have a handy reference.  In reading dreams, you’ll need to focus on several factors. One of these is context and setting. Pay attention to where dreams occur, what it is like, and whether or not the setting is familiar to you.   Did your dream occur somewhere that you have been before, for example? Or perhaps it was a strange location or even your mind’s invention? These details could point to meaning. Be aware of the dream’s time-frame. For example, while some dreams take place at an indeterminate time, others are vaguely in the future or have a clear date. Note any associations that you have with a dream’s context, as well. Were you at your late grandparents’ farm? Maybe you were at church. Write these details down, too.  Note the people, animals, or other non-human beings that appear to you in dreams and consider your relationship to them. The figures who appear in our dreams can sometimes carry meaning or represent other parts of our psyche, that is, parts of the mind that might want to give you a message.   Record who these figures are and what they do in your dream, making sure to analyze how they interact with you. Be as specific as possible. People in your dreams may not represent anything out of the ordinary. For instance, if you dream about an ex-boyfriend, he might simply represent your ex-boyfriend. Sometimes, however, figures appear in dreams that carry messages. Figures with whom you have a less direct personal relationship can especially be these harbingers of news – or even of the future., Dreams often have an emotional overtone or feeling to them, recording and analyzing which may give you insight into its possible meaning for the future. Focus on how you felt during the dream.When you take down your impressions for each dream, pause on the emotions and try to puzzle them out. Did you feel anxious – why? Did you feel fearful or hopeful? Again, why?  , If you want to predict the future through your dreams, you’ll need to inform yourself about dreams as such and their meaning. For one thing, your daily life and emotions have a lot do to with what you dream. They can contain fragments of our activities and thoughts as well as anxieties, hopes, and fears. If you dream about flying or coming to class naked, for example, you are probably dreaming about suppressed fears rather than the future.   You might try reading up on dream symbology to help in your self-analysis. The idea that dreams reflect the subconscious and can “symbolize” things in our minds was pioneered by psychologists like Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, for example. Pick up a copy of Freud’s “The Interpretation of Dreams,” if you feel up to it. Carl Jung even thought that some images in dreams access a “collective unconscious” that cuts across all places and times. You’ll need to bone up on these ideas if you want to identify precognitive dreams., Some people have extended the work of thinkers like Freud and Jung and put together “dictionaries” of dream symbols. You can find these on the internet, with a lot of detail for symbols like water, doors, fences, dogs, cats, and other things.   To use one of these resources, go back to your dream journal, find important images, and then search for them. Try to be exhaustive and specific for, as you will see, the dictionaries often give very specific meanings. The idea behind a dream dictionary is that images or symbols have definite meanings, which you can then plug into your dream. For example, you may encounter future trouble with your sexuality if you had a foreboding dream about a mongoose.If you dream that you are trapped inside of a coffin with a mongoose, the dream might mean two things: you will have trouble with your sexuality, and that it is a situation you should address., Once you have a good record of your dreams, more knowledge about dream theories, and access to dictionaries of symbols, try hard to parse your dreams. Put together all of your resources – are there hidden messages in some?   By categorizing the things that you dream about the most, as well as people, figures, and places, you should start to have a fairly detailed map of your dreams. Slowly start to work through your dream journal to see the possible meaning of symbols. Write these symbols down or keep charts, if it helps you to stay organized. Ask yourself: do any elements of your dreams have a possible reading for future events? Some precognitive dreams might be easier to spot than others. For example, you may be aware during a dream that you are receiving a prophecy. Alternately, you may meet with a courier – this is a straightforward symbol that you are getting a message. , Dreams are highly personal and, in fact, scientists still don’t quite know why we dream. If you are seriously interested in dream interpretation, you’ll be happy to know that they may well have some meaning for your life. However, you probably won’t be able to use them to predict the future.   Some scientists think that dreams are a result of the brain firing at random. Some think that animals, humans included, evolved dreaming as a defense mechanism, while others believe that we dream in order to process information at the end of the day.Still, other people strongly believe that dreams can be something more. Perhaps they aren’t precognitive, but is it possible that a dream could be a message from someone or something? We really don’t know.  Analyzing your dreams may well help you to better understand yourself and your subconscious. You may find fears, hopes, and aspirations that you weren’t aware of before. However, whether you can take a specific lesson from a dream is not so clear.   Dreams and symbols will vary from person to person. While some might be universal, as Jung thought, many more probably aren’t. Given how unproven dream interpretation is, you should be careful about using it to guide your life or as the basis for major decisions., Many dream resources pretend to have all the answers. They will assign detailed, specific meanings for all sorts of symbols. Does dream interpretation really work like this? In fact, it is probably a lot more complex. Don’t trust everything that you read.   You know yourself best, and many times can identify the meaning or association of a symbol better than a dream dictionary. Trust your own judgement. If you want to get to the meaning behind your dreams, you might also try seeing a psychoanalyst. She might not be able to tell your future, but perhaps she can shine some light onto your subconscious.  

try to recall your dreams.  keep a dream journal.  pay attention to context.  pay attention to dream figures.  pay attention to emotions.  learn more about dreams and their general meaning.  consult dream dictionaries.  try to tell precognitive dreams from others.  recognize the limits of dream science.  recognize the limits of dream interpretation.  be wary of “one-size fits all” interpretations.

 An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  Buy quality clothing. You often get what you pay for. The bargain T-shirt you bought at your local discount Mega-Mart is not usually designed to last very long. However, purchase price is no guarantee of quality--even an expensive boutique may be basing its price on its trendiness rather than for an eye on sturdiness. Unfortunately, price often has little or nothing to do with how well-constructed a garment is. Certain brands have a reputation for quality, (such as in the USA), Land's End, L.L. Bean and Duluth Trading Company. Wash the clothing according to the instructions on the label. It is also important to read these labels prior to purchasing a garment, so you are sure that you are happy to do the type of washing or dry cleaning it requires. If not, do not buy it. Online reviews are often a good guide to how others have found the quality of the clothes. If a lot of people comment on flimsiness, pilling, and so on, that's a warning. Close zippers and clasps when machine washing clothing. Keep a set or two of older clothing around for messy or strenuous activities, such as gardening. Wear an apron or smock if you are doing something messy, such as cooking or a hobby such as painting.; , The specifics depend on what stain you are trying to remove and what fabric you're removing it from, but it's generally best to treat the stain as soon as you can.  Find your stain removal answer quickly in wikiHow's Stain Removal category.  You will need the button or a passable replacement and a needle and thread. The process only takes a few minutes, and it is one of the simplest and most common things to fix. You can even do it in front of the TV if you have to!  When you are given button and thread on the purchase of a new garment, get into the habit of keeping these in one single place for easy retrieval when needed. A small jar in the laundry room is a common tactic.   Repair seams that have torn or come undone. If a hole develops along a seam, you can usually just sew it closed again. The repair will be invisible and straightforward., If a garment has a large hole, you may have to apply a patch.  A great patch is decorative, so it becomes a feature rather than a flaw! Generally any place that has craft or sewing supplies will offer a selection of decorative patches. You can use patches made of similar or the same material. (Such as using denim fabric to replaced worn-out knees on a pair of jeans.) Iron-on patches exist, but have a tendency to come off. Sew-on patches (or iron-on patches that are sewn down) tend to last longer.  It is relatively simple to hem pants and skirts, and it will allow you to adjust the length of a garment.  One of the most common ways to fix a damaged pair of jeans are to create shorts, or "cut-offs". Another common use is to make pants a little shorter to give them a new appearance if the bottom edge is worn.  Darning is the process of rebuilding a worn fabric using a needle and thread or yarn in a process similar to weaving. It may take a bit more skill than the other techniques listed here, but it is still a good option for mending small holes and reinforcing worn spots.  Socks and thick denier tights made from wool, cotton, or cashmere can be made to last a lot longer with darning.

Sometimes bad things happen to good clothing, and it is not a simple fix. This is when a good professional can be really useful. He or she may be able come up with creative solutions, too. For instance, the ugly rip accidentally put in your prom dress could end up saved by creating a new hem line., There are a few circumstances in which a garment really cannot be fixed. These are:  The garment is threadbare and/or very fragile. Threadbare is when the fabric is worn very thin through use. Generally, it is only a matter of time before holes appear. At this point, the fabric may be completely unable to be sewn. The garment has hazardous materials on it. If your favorite shirt is covered in anti-freeze, it may not be able to be safely laundered. Permanent stains. You may be able to put a butterfly-shaped patch on that permanent marker stain. Perhaps you can attempt to make your bleach-stained jeans into a retro 80's piece.

 People read for a wide variety of reasons. Before you pick up a book, consider what you want to get out of reading. Some people like reading books that teach them new skills, from computer programming languages to skills for hunting or camping. Other people enjoy narratives, whether fictional or biographical, to transport them to other times, worlds, or situations. Think first about what you ultimately want to get out of reading.You are much more likely to learn to love reading if you connect with something that seems purposeful to you. If reading is just an exercise or something you feel you “should” like, it’s not likely to have a meaningful impact.; , Once you know whether you want to learn, be entertained, or something else entirely, you can narrow down types of books based on your answer. For instance, knowing you want an entertaining story alone doesn’t narrow between poetry, literature, popular fiction, memoir, and other types of writing, all of which could provide an entertaining narrative.   Try doing an internet search for popular books in the area that you’ve chosen. This can give you a list of suggestions where you might start. Consult with your local librarian. Librarians are usually delighted to make reading recommendations. Once you know what you’re “looking for” from your reading, ask your librarian if s/he knows of any books that might suit. Talk with the employees at your local bookstore. Most people who work at bookstores love reading and love books. They can be a great source of recommendations. Chatting with people who are passionate about reading might even spark a little fire of your own!  , You can narrow down reading choices even more once you’ve picked a general type of writing by considering the genre you want. If you’ve decided on popular fiction, for instance, you can choose between horror, science fiction, historical, fantasy, romance, mystery, or more realist books that take a less whimsical approach to their characters and settings.   As another example, if you decide to want to read nonfiction history books, then consider the time period and subjects that most interest you. A book about D-Day in Normandy during World War II will obviously be a very different reading experience than a book about the politics of the Roman senate around the time of Julius Caesar.  Even within a particular genre, a particular writer’s style might not work for you due to his/her particular voice. This can be due to when the book was written, the tone, the point of view, or a number of other reasons. If you don’t like a book in the genre you think you should most enjoy, try to narrow down the reason why.   For instance, if you decide you want to read horror novels, older novels such as Frankenstein or Dracula are going to read very differently than Stephen King or Clive Barker novels.  You may feel very passionately about social issues or something else. Seek out books that connect to the issues about which you are passionate or that frame the issue in a wider context.Remember that you can read more than books, too. Look at print and online magazines, blogs, and other places to find other reading material.  People sometimes feel obligated to finish a book even when they don’t like it. You’ll develop an aversion to reading rather than a love of it if you try to slog through a 300-page novel that you don’t like. Many books can start slow as they develop the setting and people/characters involved, but if a book hasn’t hooked you within 50-75 pages, then there’s nothing wrong with moving to another one.  Reading isn’t a competition. It’s a deeply personal, highly subjective activity. There’s no reason why you should feel guilty for not loving that award-winning novel everyone’s talking about. Nor should you feel embarrassed if you truly love something that others may consider “lowbrow,” like comics or romance novels. Read what you love, and don’t compare yourself to anyone else.  

consider why you want to read.  identify what you want to read.  consider the genre you think you’ll most enjoy.  sample the genre to find writers who click with you.  make connections between reading and other interests.  put down books you don’t like.  remember that reading is deeply personal. 

 Suede has a soft grain that is best cleaned with a special brush, which you can purchase with a suede cleaning kit. If your shoes have a care label, use whatever the manufacturer suggests. Suede is also very sensitive to water, so basic dirt and scuffs are best dealt with when the shoes are dry.       ; , Use the suede cleaning brush to lightly brush away dust or dirt that has accumulated on your shoes. Don't go back and forth: brush repeatedly towards the same direction. Once you get off this layer of grime, your shoes will already look newer.  When you scuff your shoes, the suede's grain can get pressed down in one direction. Lift the grain by brushing scuffed areas vigorously back and forth. Again this is best done with a suede brush.          For scuffs that are too matted down to respond to the brush, try scraping the area with a knife to lift the nap.  Scuffs and marks that won't brush out can often be removed by rubbing with a pencil eraser or a piece of crepe rubber (the crinkled rubber that many shoe soles are made from). You can also by a special suede eraser designed for just this task. Apply a moderate amount of pressure and increase as tougher marks require.  Once they are clean (or when you first get them), spray a coat of suede protector spray on your shoes. This will help prevent further stains and marks. Follow the manufacturer's directions.         

get a suede brush and make sure your shoes are dry.  brush gently to remove dirt.  brush vigorously to remove scuff marks.  use an eraser for stubborn marks.  protect your suede. 

 This article assumes that you already own the game, and know the basic game play.; , This is found by pressing Tab. In this mode, you can discover lots of new angles, zoom in more, and discover more areas of the game. The camera controls are Q, W, E, A, S, Z, and X. This is extremely helpful, since you cannot see objects become highlighted when moused over, and the angles are much more creative then the basic camera. You can exit Cameraman by simply pressing Tab again.  Make a list of main characters, extras, settings, the number of seasons you intend to create, episode titles, soundtrack, descriptions, etc.  Make one family for your main characters, then your extras. Make them look different. Don't have a cast of all goths, punks, preps, jocks, nerds, etc. (unless the storyline has to do with a bunch of similar people).  Then move your families in. Move the extras in first, give them a phone, and then move your Mains into the next lot. Then build the set. Play the family for a bit, then wait for your neighbors to come over to greet you. At least one of your extras will stop by.   Turn on testingcheats (see the Tips section below) and make one of the main characters greet them. Hold down Shift and click on the extra (we call this Shift+clicking) click on Make Selectable. Raise both relationships to at least 25 by performing friendly actions or by going to the Relationships panel of either Sim and dragging the relationship bar to the right. When it comes time to record your scene, Shift+click the extra again and choose Make Unselectable, and then make one of your main characters say goodbye to everyone. Get a Sim to pick up the phone and call the same extra and choose Invite Household, choosing every extra you need. They will come over, and now you can make them all selectable.    Videos look best on Medium, High, and High uncompressed quality, and when the size is Large. Be warned: this can slow down your game when filming.  If you have a computer with Windows Me, XP or Vista, it comes with a basic editor called Windows Movie Maker. If you have Windows 7, 8.1 or 10, you can download the Windows Essentials which will give you an updated version of Windows Movie Maker for those versions of Windows. On Mac, you will have a program called iMovie. For picture editing, you can get The GIMP, which is a free image editor similar to Adobe Photoshop.  Use songs that you think people would like, and songs that will capture attention of viewers.  Try to vary voice actors or voices, so viewers can distinguish between characters.  The feeling you get when you lose all your hard work is awful, and nobody likes to have to start from scratch. Make sure that you turn off all cheats and that no Sim is on the phone when you save, or else you might corrupt your file. (Yes, you can corrupt your game by saving with Sims on the phone!)  , Make sure your description is appealing so that it attracts lots of other viewers. Remember that many people online will say bad things in the comments. Just ignore them. On YouTube, you can delete their comments and report the troll to YouTube.  

purchase the sims 2.  explore cameraman view.  plan out your series.  create your cat.  make 2 empty lots (the biggest size works best for sets), one for your mains, the next for your extras.  begin filming!,  download video and picture editing software from the web.  if you are using subtitles for the video, have a fun, nice soundtrack to go with it.  if you are doing a voice over video, pick voice actors with a personality and voice that fits your characters.  make sure you save often, while you are playing the game, and when you're making your movie.  when you are done with your episode or movie, upload it to a video sharing site such as youtube, vimeo or dailymotion and give a link to your friends. 

 People who struggle with excessive hoarding save excessive items in a disorganized manner, often creating a dangerous living environment. People who hoard are often unable to discard any items, even if they have no monetary value. They save these items out of sentimentality or due to fear that they may need the item in the future.Hoarders often create rooms in their homes that can no longer be used as they are intended due to an accumulation of clutter. Hoarders often collect newspapers, magazines, brochures, and other documents that contain information so that they can read and digest the information at a later date, but many do not get around to actually reading the papers. Hoarders attach strong emotions to objects and feel that possessions offer them a sense of comfort or security. They may feel as though letting go of a possession is losing a part of themselves.; , The reasons behind hoarding vary from person to person, but hoarders consistently show an emotional or psychological connection to the items. They also exhibit a resistance to thinking or talking about the extent of the clutter., If you do not live with the hoarder, be sure to stop by to check on and socialize with him when you can. You should use your visits to determine whether conditions are improving or worsening. You may need to evaluate whether the hoarder has reached a point of being a danger to himself.  Many hoarders may admit to being “pack rats” or wanting to keep things, but they do not understand concerns about health or safety. They may not see their behavior as problematic, and often do not realize the impact that their behaviors have on others. , You should communicate your concerns for the hoarder’s health and safety, but try not to sound judgmental.Try focusing on the health risks, including mold, dust, and cleanliness. You can also focus on environmental safety, pointing out fire hazards and blocked exits.   Try not to spend too much time focusing on the clutter or objects themselves, as this will likely cause the hoarder to become defensive. For example, you might say “I care about you, and I am concerned for your safety. The apartment has become quite dusty and moldy, and because of the large piles everywhere, I don’t think you could get out quickly and safely in an emergency.”  , Organizing or throwing away items without the hoarder’s permission can give him serious anxiety.Instead, assure him that no one is going to enter his home and throw away his things. Offer to help sort through items or seek input from a professional organizer. Ultimately, the hoarder needs to maintain control of the decision making about what to do with items.   Try to use the language the hoarder uses to refer to the clutter. If the hoarder call the items his collection or his things, mirror the language he uses to seem more non-confrontational.  You can gather information and try to help the hoarder by finding out more about how and why he has saved and organized the items in his possession. Try to enforce the hoarder’s feeling of control; remember, you’re trying to help, not tell him what to do.   Some examples of questions to ask include: “I notice there are a lot of books in the hallway. Why did you decide to put them there?” “I’m concerned these could be a tripping hazard in an emergency. Do you have somewhere else we could put them?” “Do you have any thoughts about how we could make this area safer?”  , Productive goals that will help the hoarder will focus on improving the quality of life and the functionality of the living space. Be sure to make the goals measurable.   Do not focus the goals on negatives (get rid of all of this junk). Do not set vague goals like “get the house clean and organized.” A better goal would be “clear the hallway and make all exit doors easily accessible.” Start with the bigger concerns about health and safety, then move on to smaller goals that will improve quality of life.  It is important to be gentle and patient when working with a hoarder. Remember that hoarding is an emotional issue, and simply cleaning for a hoarder does not solve a long-term problem. You also risk violating the trust of the hoarder and losing any ground you may have gained with him.   Do not nag, force, or punish someone who is struggling with hoarding. Do not argue or yell at a person who is hoarding. Instead, try to team up with him to work towards a goal together., Whenever the hoarder makes an effort to improve an area, praise him for his progress. You may notice a small area that has been de-cluttered or be able to see a patch of wall that wasn’t visible before. No matter how small the improvement is, it should elicit praise and positivity from you.  While it can be difficult to externally motivate someone, you may be able to find a way for the hoarder to become motivated to improve. For example, you might suggest that he can host a party or a social gathering. This may encourage him to improve his living area before other people come over.  A person who struggles with hoarding may not have the skills to organize and sort items themselves. If he is open to help, offer to help him organize and sort through items. You may want to gather storage containers, shelving units, boxes, and labels before you start.   Start by labeling boxes or bags with “keep,” “trash,” and “donate.” You probably need to make a space to pile items to think about or come back to. Group similar items together. Seeing a large quantity of a single thing may help the hoarder make peace with reducing the number of a specific item. For example, if he has 100 boxes of tissue, he may be willing to reduce the number of boxes to 50. This is a small step, but it will help. Categorize “want” and “don’t want.” You can start the “don’t want” pile with something that is an easier decision, like food items that have expired or dead plants. Discuss where things that are to be kept will go. This may be a specific room in the house or a storage unit.  Two key indications of hoarding are social or occupational impairment and an unsafe living environment. Left unchecked, hoarding can lead to an increasingly unsafe environment, health concerns, financial consequences, and strained relationships.Specific hazards that can result from hoarding include:  blocked exits creating fire hazards or building code violations increased health risk for environmental irritants such as mold and dust as well health code violations decreased hygienic habits due to inability to perform hygienic tasks such as bathing increased isolation and avoidance of socializing strained family relationships, child neglect, and separation or divorce    , The process of cleaning and organizing a huge accumulation of items will take a significant amount of time. This is not a problem that can be fixed in one day. It will take a long period of small, persistent efforts to organize a hoarder’s home.  

recognize hoarding behaviors.  understand underlying issues that lead to hoarding.  check on the hoarder frequently.  identify the problem.  state your concerns in a non-judgmental manner.  ask for permission to help.  ask questions about the collected items.  help the hoarder establish goals.  avoid causing distress.  praise improvements.  find a motivation to improve.  develop a plan.  know the consequences of extended hoarding.  give it time. 

 You can buy fleece in a variety of colors, patterns and thicknesses. Choose your fleece according to needed warmth and personal style, using whatever patterns and colors you want.   You can choose accessories such as buttons, sequins or gems to add later if you'd like.; , Most adult heads are approximately 21 to 23 inches (53.3 to 58.4 cm) around. Fleece has some stretch to it, so you should be able to use a 23-inch (58.4-cm) hat pattern for most people.  You want the stretch of the fabric to run across the width of your head, so that it will fit tightly. Check which direction the fabric stretches, too. What direction does it naturally pull towards?   This is also going to show you where the back side of the fleece is -- if you stretch the fleece between two hands, the fabric will naturally curl towards the backside (the side touching your head) of the fleece., You'll need a pattern to help you cut the right shapes and sizes out of your fabric. Search for "fleece beanie pattern" online and check out the shapes that you like. There are often subtle variations between hats, and this is your chance to choose the exact design you want.   Make sure your print it "to size." Do not print it to "fit page," as the actual size of the pattern is crucial! Print at 100% or "actual size." They often provide a 1-inch square on the design that you can check with a ruler. Most fleece beanie patterns differ slightly in their construction. They will have 4 side panels and a bottom band. Some patterns will allow you to work from one piece, while others will separate the fleece into up to five pieces.  The following measurements provide more than enough fleece to make your hat from. Cut a rectangle of fleece that is approximately 23 inches (58.4 cm) wide by 12 inches (30.5 cm) tall. Reduce the measurements to 19 inches (48.3 cm) wide or 21 inches (53.3 cm) wide for a toddler or smaller adult, respectively.   When in doubt, leave a 1/2 inch of excess -- you can always cut it later, but it can make construction easier.  Across the width means folding it like a sandwich, not like a hotdog bun. (14.6 cm by 30.5 cm). You should have a long, doubled up rectangle of fabric.  Make sure that the point of the beanie aligns with the top of the longer side (30.5-cm). There will be a long horizontal line through the pattern, usually labeled "stretch." This line needs to be lined up with the natural stretch of the fabric, found earlier.  Repeat on another stretch of fabric, preferably close to the first cut, so that you have 4 total domed pieces.   Make sure the pattern doesn't move on the fabric as you cut. Pinning it down with sewing needles is a good way to keep everything straight. Use at least two pins, if so.  If you want a solid colored beanie, cur out four more domes from the same fleece. Simply repeat the process above with a new fabric for a reversible hat.   By now, you should have at least eight pieces of fabric in the dome-like beanie shape.  Some patterns simply attach the domed pieces into a beanie, but that classic "lip" of a beanie is easy to add. This will be a rectangular piece of pattern, which you cut right at the fold in your fleece. This leads to one piece of fabric that is twice as long as your pattern, but folded in half so that it appears the same size. You will need two of these.   Remember to cut half in one pattern, half in the other pattern, if you're making a reversible hat.  When finished cutting, you should have a total of 10 pieces of fabric:   8 pieces of dome shaped fabric.  4 in one color, 4 in another.   2 long pieces for the trim.  1 in one color, 1 in another.  You will want to sew on the side that will be the inside of your hat. Remember that you can stretch the fabric to find what side is the back if it is not obvious. The side the fabric curls towards, when stretched, is the back.  You want the good sides facing each other. Follow the curve with your sewing machine (1/4 inch seam allowance) to attach the two pieces, almost like a book. Use a straight stitch.   Make sure the overlap goes wrong-side-out, on the side that will soon be the inside of your hat. You will need to feed your fabric through the machine in a curved motion so that it follows the dome shape.  When you get to the last side, pin the sides together and sew from the bottom of the hat to the top of the last dart tip. You should end up with four sewed together pieces.  Take two of your book-like domes and place them together, good sides touching. Then pin them at the top, matching along the center seam. Try to make sure the seams both face the opposite way to prevent getting bulky. Do this with all four books, so you end up with two sets of matching fabrics pinned together.  This will finally attach each of the four pieces of matching fabric into a "mini-beanie." Simply sew along the entire long edge of the dome, using the same 1/4 inch seam allowance, and a straight stitch. Repeat with the other set of fabric, leaving your two small beanies.  Measure and fold a 3-inch (7.3-cm) hem at the bottom of your hat. You will now make the band at the bottom of your hat.  Touch the shorter sides together, matching them up perfectly, then sew the two short ends together so you end up with a fabric ring. Repeat with the other hem piece.  Wrap the ring of fabric around your hat, lining up the seam of the ring with one of the hat's seams. Pin it here and on the opposite side. Then use as many pins as you need to match up the edges, lining them up so you can sew them cleanly.   You want the good side of the hat fabric to be touching the good side of the hem fabric. Remember to stretch to check if need be.  You may need to remove the sewing table extension, making it easier to sew in a circle. Use the same 1/4 inch straight seam, and slowly sew all the way around the bottom edge of the hat and ring to attach them.   Repeat with the opposite hat and hem as well. For a little extra fun, mix up the fabrics -- use the hem from one fleece with the hat from the other.  There is one place on each hat where the seam of the hat and hem are lined up. Press these seams together, then flip one hat over the other one so that they are nested in each other, like stacked plastic cups.  This is your opening to allow the hat to flip successfully. Pin and sew the two hats together just like you sewed the hem onto the bottom of the hat. This time, however, you need to leave about 2" of the edge unsewed, allowing you to pull it out easily.  You'll end up with a weird, bean-shaped fabric oval. Reach into the opening with your fingers and gently pull the fabric back through.  Push half of the oval into the other half, leaving you with your finished beanie! Stitch together the little opening you made to finish the edge and prevent it from unraveling.  

buy 1 yard (0.9 m) of the fleece of your choice at a local craft store.  measure the circumference of your head.  feel the way your fleece stretches before you set it on your table to mark and cut.  download, print, and cut out a pattern for your hat online.  cut a long piece of fabric from the cloth to work with.  fold the fabric in half across the width, making sure to align the ends.  place the printed template on top of the piece of folded fabric.  use sharp fabric scissors to cut through both layers of fleece, following the outline of your pattern.  cut four more domes out, using a different fabric if you want a reversible hat.  cut out any sets of trim, if included in the pattern, using the folded fabric to make a doubled up, folded piece.  make sure you have all of your pieces.  turn the fleece so that the back side of the fabric is facing out.  stack a two pieces of fabric on top of each other and sew them together along half of the curve.  repeat on the second, third and fourth domed tips to make darts.  pin matching sets of fabric together at the top.  sew the entire curved edge of your pined pieces, making two complete hats.  keep the wrong side facing out.  fold the long hem or trim pieces width-wise, good side touching good side, and sew them into large rings.  match up the seam of your hem with the seam of your hat pieces, then pin them.  sew all the way around the edges to attach the hem to the hat.  match up the two smaller "hats" and line them up by the longest seam.  pin the two hats in place along the bottom edge and sew them, leaving a 2" space un-sewed.  pull the fabric through your opening.  tuck half of the beanie into the other, leaving you with a beautiful beanie. 

 The ideal Cavalier owner is reasonably active and looking for a dog with a rock-solid gentle temperament to make a good companion for a family. If you are looking for a guard dog, then the Cavalier is definitely not for you, as it is likely to welcome a thief with a lick and a waggy tail. Also, if you wish to go running or hiking with a Cavalier, they are likely to tire and you are better suited to a larger dog. However, if you need a dog that will play heartily and enjoys a good walk but without needing excessive amounts of exercise, then a Cavalier is a good choice.; , Generally, the Cavalier is a small dog with a long coat. The Cavalier belongs to the toy group of dogs and weighs around 5.4 - 8.0 kg. They have a moderately long coat that is soft and silky.   The colors recognized by the US Kennel Club are Blenheim (chestnut markings on a white background), tricolor (black, tan and white), ruby (tan), and black and tan., In practical terms, when choosing a puppy find a breeder who can show that their dogs are free of disease both now and in previous generations. This can be tricky to do, as there is no certified system, but a responsible breeder will be able to prove their dogs have had regular vet checks and no problems were found at annual vaccinations.   Unfortunately there is currently no screening tests that are practical for breeders in order to ensure their breeding stock are clear of many problems common to Cavaliers. The only option for some diseases is for breeders to screen their breeding stock with an MRI scan, but this is costly and thus not normal practice.With regards to heart disease, the symptoms usually develop in middle age onwards, and so it can be difficult to guarantee a parent is free from heart disease early in its life (when it is likely to have pups)., Be aware how important socialization of the puppy is, when it comes to the Cavalier growing into a confident well-adjusted adult dog. The breeder should make efforts for as many different people as possible to meet the puppies from around 3 - 4 weeks of age, so the young dogs are used to people of different heights, appearances, and tones of voice.   The puppies should not be exclusively reared in a kennel, as this isolates them from the normal sights, sounds, and activities of a domestic house, and they will find it more difficult to adjust to family life.  Even if a breeder claims the dog is healthy, have the dog tested for yourself. The Cavalier's only downside is its health. Unfortunately, the breed is over represented when it comes to serious health issues such as heart disease, syringomyelia, and Chiari-like malformation.Thus, a truly adorable family pet could die prematurely through heart disease, or suffer terrible pain during their lifetime from syringomyelia & Chiari-like malformation. The genetic problems associated with Cavaliers include:   Syringomyelia and Chiari like malformation: Fluid accumulates in and around the spinal cord, and the brain case is too small for the brain, putting it under pressure. Signs include yelping in pain, scratching at the neck, trying to catch imaginary flies, and depression. Mitral valve disease: The heart valve in the left side of the heart fails to close properly, leading to an inefficient circulation. As heart disease leads to heart failure, the dogs may cough, become breathless, lack energy, be unable to exercise, and collapse. Luxating patellas: This are wobbly kneecaps, which can move from side to side and cause the dog to hop on the affected leg.  It is absolutely essential to avoid buying a puppy from a puppy farm. Not only because of the unethical way the puppies are bred and looked after, but because there is no control over the health of the parent dogs, so you are highly likely to be buying a pup brewing up health problems later in life.   Never, ever buy a puppy from a puppy mill. A cardinal sign of a puppy mill is the breeder makes an excuse as to why the mother dog is not available to view. This is because in reality the mother dogs is probably hundreds of miles away, waiting to be bred to produce yet more puppies. In the meantime, her litter are taken away far too young and transported large distances to places for sale. This trade is unethical and immoral, and should not be encouraged by buying these puppies and creating a demand.  Your dog will need vaccinating against various canine infectious diseases. Exactly which diseases depends on which infections are prevalent in your area, so your veterinarian should advise you about which vaccinations are needed. The vet will select those diseases with are common in the area (core) and those less common (non-core) and discuss which are most appropriate for your dog.   The vaccinations your dog might get include distemper, parvovirus, canine adenovirus, leptospirosis, infectious canine hepatitis, parainfluenza virus and Lyme disease. In addition, a vaccination against rabies is obligatory in many states and you will be breaking the law not to comply. Different vaccines are given at different ages. Typically the rabies vaccine is given as a single dose after 12 weeks of age, repeated every 1 to 3 years (depending on the manufacturer) or if given earlier (some brands can be given from 4 weeks of age,) a second dose must be given at or after 12 weeks of age.Other vaccinations are given in three doses 3 - 4 weeks apart, with the final dose always falling around 16 weeks of age.This is so the puppy receives protection from the vaccine at a young age, but not so early that it doesn't get the effect of antibodies derived from the mother. By 16 weeks of age, these maternal antibodies have waned and so once vaccinated the pup will be protected for approximately a year. At one-year-old the puppy will get the first booster injection. Your Cavalier should receive yearly booster injections according to the protocol advised by your vet.  Deworming medications come in a wide variety of forms, including tablets, oral liquids or granules, and spot-on products. Each product has a slightly different spectrum of activity, so your vet is the best resource to discuss what's best for your pet. A basic worming regime is against roundworms (monthly) with a quarterly broad spectrum wormer against whipworms and tapeworms.   Treatment against heartworm is also advisable, either as a six-monthly injection, or a monthly spot-on treatment at home. Fleas are unpleasant and can cause skin allergies and infections if left untreated. If your Cavalier spends a lot of time outdoors, another common parasite you should have it treated for are ticks, which also carry unpleasant diseases such as Lyme's disease or tick borne fever. Prevention is better than cure, so this involves using a product effective against fleas and ticks, such as fipronil (Frontline or Effipro) or the Seresto collar.  Neutering or spaying should be discussed with your veterinarian. It is usual to operate on females from 4 - 6 months of age, and males around 6 -10 months of age, however, this varies depending on the individual vet clinic. The obvious advantage of neutering is that it prevents unscheduled breeding. It can also protect the female dog against mammary cancer, if surgery if performed before the bitch's second heat.   If your Cavalier does develop health problems, such as syringomyelia or a heart murmur, then you must absolutely not breed from the dog. Breeding a dog with hereditary diseases risks passing the problem down to future generations.  Dogs should not be fed too much grain or filler. Look at the label on the food container and make sure a named meat is the first and second ingredient on the bag.   If you are unsure what food to feed your dog, consult with your veterinarian for suggestions. When you adopt a dog or puppy you should transition it off of the food it has been eating if you want to change its diet. Find out what it has been eating, buy a small supply of that food, and then gradually mix in the new food you want to feed it. This transition should take over a week before you are only feeding the new food.  Use the amount recommended on the package as a starting point, but regularly weigh your Cavalier to make sure they are not gaining too much weight. Some Cavaliers can be quite greedy, so be aware you can't use how hungry they appear as a gauge of how much to feed them.   Be aware that your dog may be prone to beg for food and treats. Use treats sparingly, as they can add a lot of calories to your dog's diet if given in excess.  Wait for at least 90 minutes after feeding before exercise. If you exercise a dog too soon after feeding there is a risk of the dog's stomach flipping over and becoming twisted, which is a life-threatening condition called bloat., You should never limit your dog's access to water or leave only dirty water out for your dog. Dehydration can occur quickly, especially in warm weather.  Take care of your dog's teeth by getting into the habit of regular tooth brushing. Use a special dog toothbrush or a finger mitt. Wet the brush with water and gently rub it on the outer surfaces of the teeth. Once the dog is happy with this you can introduce a blob of dog toothpaste onto the brush.   These pastes are tasty to dogs, don't need rinsing, and are free from substances harmful to dogs if swallowed, such as fluoride.  Comb the dog through daily, and brush out at least once a week.Cavaliers have a soft, silky coat that can become knotted, especially when the dog is outdoors and gets leaves tangled in its fur. Regular brushing will keep the tangles under control, so they don't become matted.   It's best check your dog over after each walk. Look for grass awns or burrs that may be lodged in fur around the ears or paws, in addition tangles and debris.  Become familiar with your dog's body so you have a good idea of what a healthy body shape is for it. A dog in good body condition should have a waist line when viewed from above or the side, and you should be able to feel its ribs easily, but without the ribs standing out through the skin.   If you inspect your dog's body regularly, for example when you brush it, then you will be able to spot changes more easily.  Cavaliers are gentle good-natured dogs, but, as with all canines, they enjoy the sense of security associated a capable owner who demonstrates they are in charge. Training sessions should be reward-based and clicker training lends itself ideally to this.   The principle behind clicker training is that the dog associates the click-clack of the clicker with a reward. When the dog shows a desired behavior (such as "sit") the click-clack marks the exact moment being rewarded, which helps the dog understand what behavior earns a reward. Then a cue word "Sit" is added to the click-clack, and eventually the clicker noise dropped in favor of the command. Good basic commands to teach are Sit, Stay, and Come. This equips you with good control of the dog because you can stop them and recall them to you, whatever the circumstances, hence keeping the dog safe.  Your Cavalier will love the one-to-one time with you, so training generally strengthens the bond between you. Try to schedule two, 10 - 15 minutes sessions a day.  Cuddle it, snuggle it, and pet it every day. What a Cavalier wants most from life is to be loved and adored. Make sure you don't disappoint your dog by ignoring it. The love you give you will get back ten fold from your Cavalier.  

consider your needs from a dog.  decide whether the physical attributes of a cavalier are desirable to you.  choose a breeder that has a track record of healthy and ethical breeding.  make sure a potential breeder socialized its puppies.  have any potential dogs screened for disease or hereditary problems.  avoid bad breeders and puppy mills.  get your cavalier vaccinated.  get your dog treated for worms and parasites.  have your dog desexed.  give your cavalier a good quality food.  feed your dog the right amount of food.  never exercise your dog immediately after eating.  make sure your cavalier has plenty of fresh water available at all times.  brush your cavalier's teeth.  brush your dog regularly.  assess your dog's body while you brush it.  train your cavalier.  spend time training your dog every day.  lavish your cavalier with love. 

 After enough time has passed and you feel that you both got some perspective, you should start giving your ex the opportunity to see you having a great time. Starting going to the parties where he goes, or run into him with a friend at his favorite coffee shop or bar. Don't be too obvious about it, but let him see you with your other friends and remember how much fun it is to hang out with you.   If you know you'll see him, look your best without being too obvious that you're dressing up for him.  When you do run into him, greet him with a smile and a surprised look -- you were so busy having fun that you didn't even think about the possibility of him being around.  This doesn't work for everyone, but if you think that having your ex see you with another guy, or just flirting with a group of guys, will make him want to be around you even more than go for it. This doesn't mean you should get another boyfriend just to make him jealous. Just let him see you flirting, tossing your hair back, or even getting on the dance floor with another guy or two.   Don't go too far with this one. If he thinks you're actually dating someone else, he may back off. Or who knows -- that might make him want you even more.  Without being too obvious, post some photos of you having a great time with your friends, you at the beach, or even you hanging out with a few guys. This will make your ex remember how great you look and feel sad that he doesn't hang out with you anymore. Don't post anything too often -- just once or twice a week to remind him of how amazing you are.   Pick a time when you know he's likely to be online -- if you know his schedule, you'll have a sense of when he's most likely to look at your pics.  Start making your relationship a bit more friendly. Move on from the casual hello to a short conversation, and then even stick around and chat with him for ten or even twenty minutes. Make sure you always say goodbye first, though, and don't make him linger longer than he wants to. This will make him even more sad to see you go. Then, wait for him to ask you to grab a coffee, or be bold and ask him for a drink.   Don't give him any sign that you want to date him again. Just be really amazing and friendly, and he'll want to be with you again.  As you start hanging out maybe once, or twice a week, let him see that whatever quality he didn't like about you or your relationship is no longer there. If he thought you never listened to him, give him a chance to talk more. If he thought you were too clingy, let him see how independent you've become.   Don't be too obvious about it. Don't say, "Don't you see how I'm no longer jealous when you talk to other girls?" Instead, just don't look jealous when he talks to other girls, and he'll figure out the rest.  If your ex wants to get back with you, you'll know. How did you know that he wanted you the first time? It's likely that he'll be sending similar signals your way. If he flirts with you, tells you that you look nice, lightly touches you, or just always asks what you're up to or if you're seeing anyone else, then yeah, he probably wants you back.   Look at his body language. Does he make eye contact, try to stand close to you, and does his face light up with you walk in the room? If so, then he may want you back. If he just wants to keep you in the Friend Zone, then he won't act affectionate or loving towards you. Check out his Facebook or try to find out if he's seeing someone from mutual friends without being too obvious about it. He may be seeing someone else and is just talking to you to be nice or because he wants to be friends.  If your ex starts to flirt with you and picks up on the fact that you want him again, he may just ask you out again if he's feeling it too. Or if you think he's liking hanging out with you again, you can just be bold and tell him how you feel, and then start dating him again if he feels the same way.   This time, take it easy. Don't see him more than a few times a week. Work on building a solid foundation instead of jumping right in where you left off. Unless one problem in the relationship was your independence; you should be more independent than last time. Don't build your social schedule around your boyfriend's, and spend more time with friends or just doing your own thing.  

let your ex see you having a great time without him.  make him jealous (optional).  make him jealous on social media.  start hanging out with him a bit.  let him see how you've changed.  read the signs.  slowly start to date again. 

 Do you know for sure that the guy doesn’t like you back? Try giving him subtle cues that you like him. If he’s giving you mixed signals in return, don’t take it personally. Middle school age can be confusing for everyone.The guy may be shy. Even if he acts confident around certain girls, it may be because he feels comfortable around them as friends. For example, wait for the right moment, than give him a compliment like, “You’re a great listener.” Try sending him a text with a cute nickname that lets him know you’re thinking about him and his interests. Say something like “Hey hun. How did your baseball game go?”; , It’s possible that this guy doesn’t even know that you like him. If you’re not sure whether he knows, you may want to tell him that you like being around him. Use the term “like,” not “love.”Try saying, “I like studying with you.” If you want to be even more direct, try saying,”I like being around you.”  , Whether he is in your group of friends or is your best friend: if you really think you will be able to outgrow and move past crushing on this guy, you could always try to stay friends. This will be even easier to do if you work through your crush just between you and the guy, without getting mutual friends involved. That way if he doesn’t like you back, you can continue hanging out without it feeling as awkward.If you don’t feel that you can remain friends, you can tell him the truth, but don’t be angry or act like he did something wrong. Try saying, “It’s just difficult for me to hang out with you because I had a crush on you, you know? It’s not because of you – you’re a great guy.” If you don’t want to tell him directly that it’s too painful to remain friends, you can ease yourself out of his life gradually by making yourself less available. For example, you may be too busy with studying, after-school activities or family obligations to meet up.  If your crush doesn’t seem to want to talk or is acting like he feels uncomfortable, it is best to distance yourself. You may also want to back off if it feels too difficult for you to be friends. It may be hard to do if you share the same class(es), but try to avoid your crush during social times like lunch and recess.Stop visiting your crush’s social media pages. Unfollow them or change your settings so that you don’t see their posts., It’s painful, but you have to respect his feelings. You don’t want to make him uncomfortable – even friends shouldn’t do that to each other. If you do things to try and make him like you back, then you aren’t being yourself. People should like you for who you already are.Don’t change your look or the way you act to get someone else’s attention. Guys who like you will notice you on their own.  When you have to be around this guy, keep a cool head. Instead of focusing on him and what he’s doing, tell yourself positive affirmations about yourself in your head. Ignore him. Think about how much you are improving, be positive, and choose not to suffer.   For example, think to yourself, “I feel confident and secure. I accept and love myself.”  , Don’t keep trying to text or talk to the guy. A crush shouldn’t take you away from doing other life activities.If you are spending a ton of time thinking about your crush and you can’t stop yourself, you should talk to a parent or guidance counselor to get help dealing with those feelings. 

drop hints.  tell him.  stay friends.  distance yourself.  don’t try to make him like you.  act cool.  don’t obsess over it. 

 There is no clear scientific data that shows eye exercises improve your eyesight. So before you attempt eye exercises, it's a good idea to get a professional eye exam done by your optometrist. Your optometrist can then tell you if you have any existing eye problems or issues. Before you try eye exercises, you should ask your optometrist if these exercises would benefit your particular set of eyes.Keep in mind that eye exercises will not cure or solve eye issues like myopia (nearsightedness), presbyopia (an inability to change focus from far to near), or astigmatism (blurred vision due to the shape of your cornea).Most optometrists are skeptical of eye exercises that claim they can help you "throw away your glasses."There is no harm in trying these eye exercises if you do not have any eye conditions that will be aggravated by prolonged use of your eyes. But if you have serious eye conditions like cataracts, blindness in one or both eyes, or a recovering cornea injury, avoid doing these exercises.; , Doing this will reduce stimuli to your eyes and brain. Closing your eyes and applying light pressure to them will spread the tear film in your eyes evenly and relax them.         Sit comfortably in a chair. Rub your hands together until they feel warm. Close your eyes and cover them lightly with your cupped palms. Avoid applying pressure to your eyeballs. Your nose should not be covered to ensure you have enough ventilation during the palming. Make sure no light can enter your eyes though gaps between your fingers or the edges of your palms and nose. The light will stimulate, rather than relax your eyes, and deter the process of relaxation. Imagine deep blackness and focus on it. Take deep breaths slowly and evenly while thinking of a calming scene, like an empty beach, a clear lake, or a still mountain. Once you see nothing but blackness, remove your palms from your eyes. Repeat the palming for three minutes or more.  This will help to improve blood circulation around your eyes and face, and prepare your eyes for exercise.         Apply a hot and cold compress: Soak a towel in warm water, and a towel in cold water. Place the warm towel on your face, making sure it drapes over your eyebrows, closed eyelids, and cheeks. After three minutes, remove the warm towel and place the cold towel on your face. Alternate between the two towels as desired, making sure to end with a cold compress. Alternating temperatures on your face will cause vasoconstriction and vasodilation, physiological changes that will stimulate your face and the skin around your eyes. Do a full face massage: Soak a towel in warm water. Rub your neck, forehead and cheeks with the towel. Then, use your fingertips to gently massage your forehead and closed eyes. Do an eyelid massage: Wash your hands well. Then, close your eyes and massage them with circular movements of your fingers for one to two minutes. Make sure you press very lightly on your eyes as you massage them. Light pressure will help to stimulate your eyes.  This exercise will strengthen the muscles in your eyes and help you maintain your current vision level.Sit in a chair or stand in front of a blank wall. Place your thumb about 10 inches in front of your face and focus on it. You can also focus on an object that is five to 10 feet away for 10–15 seconds. Then, focus on an object that is 10–20 feet in front of you without moving your head. Focus on the object for 10–15 seconds. After 10–15 seconds, refocus on your thumb. Practice this five times.  This is a good eye focusing exercise, as you have to constantly adjust how well you can focus on an object from certain distances.         Sit in a comfortable position. Stretch out your arm with your thumb in the hitchhiking position (thumbs up). Focus on your thumb. Then, bring the thumb closer to you, focusing until your thumb is about 3 inches in front of your face. Move your thumb away again until your arm is fully outstretched. Repeat this exercise three more times, once a week. You can also practice this exercise by holding a pencil in front of you at arm’s length. Then, move your arm slowly to your nose. Follow the pencil with your eyes until you can’t focus on it any longer.  This is a great exercise to practice controlling the physical movement of your eyes.         Imagine a giant figure eight on the floor, about 10 feet in front of you. Trace the figure eight with your eyes, slowly. Trace it one way for a few minutes and then trace it the other way for a few minutes.  These movements can help to strengthen your eyes and your hand-eye coordination.         Do bar swings. Bar swings help to test your brain's ability to focus on an object with your eyes and maintain your balance and coordination. Stand in front of a fence, barred window, or something else with evenly spaced vertical lines. Focus on a distant object on the other side of the bars. Relax your body and transfer your weight from one foot to the other. Keep your breathing steady and relaxed. Don't forget to blink while performing this exercise. Continue for two to three minutes. Do round swings. This exercise helps to strengthen your peripheral vision. Focus on an object in the distance that is close to the ground. Sway as instructed for Bar Swings. Keeping your gaze on the same object, use your peripheral vision to observe your surroundings as you sway. Continue for two to three minutes.  Moving your eyes in different directions is a good way to exercise your eyes.         Stand or sit upright. Look straight ahead. Without moving your head, look to the left. Focus on what you see. Then look right. Move your eyes side to side five times. Repeat this three times. Without moving your head, look down. Focus on what you see. Then, look up. Focus on what you see. Repeat this three times. Without moving your head, look straight ahead. Then, look down and to the left. Focus on what you see. Then, move your eyes diagonally and look up and to the right. Focus on what you see. Repeat this exercise five times. Then, look straight ahead and do the same exercise looking down and to the right and then looking up and to the left. Repeat this cycle three times.  Always finish up either with palming to relax your eyes after your intense exercise session.         You can also end your eye workout by simply closing your eyes and keeping them shut in a dark, quiet room for several minutes. Let them cool down and rest.  

talk to your optometrist about eye exercises.  palm your eyes.  massage your eyes.  strengthen your eyes’ near and far focusing.  practice zooming with your eyes.  make a figure eight with your eyes.  practice rhythmic eye movements.  do directional eye exercises.  end your exercises with palming. 

 Thyroid surgery, called a thyroidectomy, is a good option if you cannot tolerate antithyroid drugs or radioactive iodine therapy. Though done in rare cases, it can be a viable option for some with high TSH levels. During the thyroidectomy, the doctor will remove most of your thyroid gland.You will be under general anesthetic during the surgery. You will need to stay in the hospital for about two days to complete the surgery.  Risks include damage to your vocal cords and to your parathyroid glands. These four small glands at the back of your thyroid gland help to control the amount of calcium in your blood.Your doctor should outline all the possible risks before you agree to the surgery.  After the thyroid surgery, you will need to recover at home for several weeks. You will need to take thyroid hormone replacement therapy for the rest of your life so you do not develop hypothyroidism.If your parathyroid glands were removed during the surgery, you will also need to take medication to maintain normal blood-calcium levels.  

speak to your doctor about thyroid surgery.  acknowledge the possible risks of the surgery.  allow yourself time to recovery after the surgery. 

 You want to show the interviewer your appreciation for their time and how happy you were to be considered. Immediately after, show proper etiquette by sending a note -- and simultaneously showing your interest and keeping your name in the pool. You'll look professional and polite on top of the qualities you showed at the interview.In certain cases, a phone call may be acceptable. If you received the interview on a name-to-name basis, you may be able to call to show your appreciation.  If you know anyone within the company that you can trust, ask them to put in a good word.Get information on how the hiring process is going and what you could do to amp up your position.   Networking should never stop. Always be on the lookout for opportunities to better yourself and your networking base.  

follow up with a thank you note.  utilize your resources. 

 Hold down the left mouse button while your cursor is over a tree trunk. This will break the tree into wooden logs. The logs will automatically enter your inventory as long as you stand close to the tree. Repeat this several times.   It does not matter whether you get oak wood, spruce wood, or any other type of wood.; , The default key for this is E. You should see a 2 x 2 grid next to your character picture. This is your crafting area.  Planks will appear in the results box to the right of the crafting area. Drag the planks to your inventory. You've now turned the wood into planks.  Place one of the planks you just made on the lower row of the crafting area. Place a second plank directly above it. Now you've made a bundle of sticks, which you should drag into your inventory from the results box.  Fill the entire 2 x 2 grid with planks to make a crafting table. Drag this to your quick slot bar at the base of your screen. Close your inventory and place the table on the ground. (To place a block, select it in your quick slot bar and right-click the ground.)   Remember not to confuse planks and wood. Only planks will work for this recipe.  Right-click the table to open an expanded crafting interface. From here you can make recipes that require a 3 x 3 grid.  The sword recipe only fills a single column of the 3 x 3 grid. All ingredients must be in the same column, but it does not matter which column you choose:   A plank on top A plank in the middle (directly below the first one) A stick at the base (directly below the planks)  , Drag the sword to a quick slot and select it to equip it. Now left-clicking will use the sword instead of your hand. This is much more effective at killing enemies or animals, but be careful. A wooden sword is still pretty weak. Skip down to the section below on better swords if you want an upgrade.  You can break apart trees with your bare hands in Minecraft. In Pocket Edition, just hold your finger down over the tree and keep it there until it's turned into wood. On consoles, use the right trigger button.  Crafting is simple in these editions of Minecraft. The crafting menu has a list of available recipes, and you click the one you want. As long as you have the right ingredients, they will turn into the desired item. Here's how to get started:In Pocket Edition, tap the icon with three dots and select Craft. On Xbox, press X. On Playstation, press Square. On Xperia Play, press Select.  The crafting table gives you access to many more craftable items, including swords. Here's how to make one:   With Wood in your inventory, craft Planks. With four Planks in your inventory, craft a Crafting Table. Select the Crafting Table in your quick bar and tap the ground to put it down. (Left trigger in console editions.)  , This is another multi-step process:   With Wood in your inventory, make Planks. With two Planks in your inventory, make Sticks. With one Stick and two Planks in your inventory, make a Wooden Sword from the Tools crafting section., When you have a sword selected in your quick slot, tapping the screen or pressing the left trigger will swing your sword. This will hurt enemies and animals much more than your bare hands.   Try jumping as you swing your sword. If you hit the target while you're falling (but not on the way up), you'll do a critical hit for 50% more damage.Keep reading if you want to upgrade to a more damaging and durable sword.  You'll need a pickaxe to gather the stone or metals for a better sword. Here's a brief summary of how to find these, from most to least common:   Stone is widely available in mountainsides and just beneath the surface. Mine it with a wooden pickaxe. Iron (stone with beige flecks) is fairly common just beneath the surface, and requires a stone pickaxe to mine. Gold and diamond ore are very rare and only found deep under the earth.  Combine two cobblestone and a stick to make a stone sword. This deals 6 damage and lasts for 132 hits before breaking. (In comparison, the wooden sword does 5 damage and lasts for 60 hits.)As with all swords, the computer recipe fills only one column, with the stick at the bottom.  Iron is a great dependable material you'll be relying on for a long time. Once you have iron ingots (see below), you can make an iron sword that does 7 damage for 251 hits.   After mining the ore, you'll need to smelt the iron ore into ingots using a furnace.  Despite its rarity, gold is not very good for tools. If you smelt the gold ingots and make them into a sword, it will deal the same damage as a wooden sword but only last for 33 hits.There is one advantage to golden swords: they have the best chance at a high level enchantment. Many players still don't like to enchant them since they're such temporary tools.  Now you've really made it in the world. Diamonds are the best material for tools and weapons, and do not require smelting. A diamond sword does eight damage and lasts for 1,562 hits., Place two damaged swords of the same type anywhere in the crafting area. The result will be a sword with more durability than both of them put together. You cannot increase the durability past the sword's normal maximum this way.A "damaged" sword is any sword that has been used at least once. You should see a small bar next to the item icon showing you how much durability is left.

 Before making a purchase, scrutinize the label. This can help you identify the pink tax. You may think certain products are marked up fairly, because they contain different ingredients or come in greater amounts. However, you may find many women's products are similar to men's products but needlessly marked up.Bring your smart phone or a calculator when you shop. Calculate the cost per unit for items like shampoos and lotions. You can do this by dividing the cost of a product versus the number of units. For example, a brand of women's shaving cream is $4.50 for a 14 ounce bottle. The cost per unit is about 32 cents. For a bottle of men's shaving cream, it's $4 for a 16 ounce bottle, making the cost per unit 25 cents. The men's shaving cream is cheaper in terms of both total cost and cost per unit. Consult the label again. Sometimes, a brand of shaving cream may have special ingredients for a specific skin type (i.e., sensitive skin, dry skin, etc.) which may explain the higher cost. In this case, it may be worth the extra price. However, if the products in question are more or less the same, opt for the men's shaving cream instead to avoid the pink tax.; , Brand name products are more likely to be marked up unnecessarily, and you may find the pink tax is particularly high for things like name brand shampoos. Compare the labels of name brand shampoos with cheaper, generic brands. When possible, opt for the generic brand of shampoo over the cheaper variety., The pink tax does not just apply to items you buy in the store. Services for women are often inexplicably more expensive. Appointments to hair salons are generally higher priced than appointments to barbershops, even if you're just getting a trim.If you have short hair, you can usually get it cut at a barbershop. Some barbershops also do long hair, however, so check with the shop. For things like coloring and styling, you may still need a salon. However, you should be able to get a basic trim at a barbershop.  The best way to identify and avoid pink taxes is to shop around. Each time you are in a store, look at the pricing of multiple products. Try to determine which products give you what you need for a reasonable price.Look at multiple items in the same store to see which brands mark up women's products. Strive to buy brands that charge similar prices for men's versus women's products. You can also go from store to store and compare prices. You may find prices slightly lower in one store versus another for basic product you use each day. While it may seem silly to go from one store to another for only a 50 cent different, think about all the money you'll save throughout the year for items you must replace multiple times a month, like facial cream, conditioners, and body washes.  Women's clothing generally require less fabric than men's clothing. However, it's often priced up anyway. If you're handy with sewing, you can buy products like men's jeans and tailor them to your body type. You can also ask a friend to take in a dress if you know someone handy at sewing.Professional tailoring is unlikely to save you much money, however. If you don't know how to sew, and do not know someone who does, it may be more cost effective to simply pay slightly more for clothes.  Besides a certain fragrance, there is little difference between men's deodorant and women's deodorant. Yet, men's deodorant is generally around 20 cents cheaper per ounce. To avoid the pink tax, go for men's deodorant when possible. This will save you money over time.If you dislike the scent of men's deodorant, go for unscented varieties.  There is very little difference between men's razors and women's razors other than the color. A razor targeted at men will work the same as a women's razor, and it comes at a much lower price. When buying razors, always opt for men's razors., Oftentimes, the only difference with toiletries (i.e., face creams, soaps, lotions, adult diapers, etc.) is something small, like the fragrance or the color of the bottle. If you're going to be washing out these products anyway, do you really need to pay extra for a smell? Does the color of the bottle really make a difference? When there does not seem to be a big difference between the products, opt for men's products., Many toy stores sell girl toys for more because of the color or design. In most toy stores or department stores, you can easily spot the girl's aisle because it's decorated in shades like pink and purple. To save money, avoid this aisle and get boy's toys of the same variety.For example, Legos and Duplos made in shades of pink and purple instead of the standard primary colors and marketed for "girls" are often sold at higher prices per unit than the standard toy, but they function the same way. Instead of paying extra for a pink or purple scooter, just pay for a boy's scooter in a different color.  Some items are marketed towards women and marked up because of superficial differences. Women's pens, for example, are often marked up simply because they are pink. Be wary of products like this. If a product, like a phone or a pen, is marked up because it's a women's product, chances are the only different is something superficial like the color., Healthcare products are often priced differently depending on gender. While it may be frustrating that certain women's products are priced more, it may sometimes be worth it to pay the extra cost. Dosages and ingredients are often based on physical differences between men and women. Something like diet supplements, for example, may have a different formula for men and women., Women's clothing is often more expensive, but may be made from different fabrics and cut differently. Some women's clothing requires less fabric, but certain items may be cut in a way that requires more fabric. If you truly like the cut of a particular clothing item, like a t-shirt, you may be better off opting to pay a bit more instead of buying men's products.You can save by buying clothing you don't really wear or show off, like socks and pajamas, in male styles. This can save you some money, allowing you to spend a little extra on a t-shirt or pair of jeans with a flattering cut.  Many times, women's shampoos cost extra due to the scent. If you love the smell of your shampoo, keep in mind you wash it out. The smell of the conditioner is really what stays in. Consider buying the conditioner for the extra cost to get the scent you love, but buying men's shampoo to save some money. 

read labels carefully.  skip name brand products.  visit a barbershop instead of a salon.  shop around.  have men's clothing tailored.  go for men's deodorant.  try men's razors.  think about men's toiletries.  stay away from gendered toys.  watch out for gimmicks.  pay the extra cost for certain healthcare products.  think about the cut of clothing before buying men's products.  try paying more for conditioner and less for shampoo. 

 In any group environment, there are factors that encourage cohesion and indicate member status.A major indication of a weeaboo in your midst is the use of broken and incomplete Japanese in casual conversation, often in emphatic or overly dramatic ways. Using Japanese ungrammatically can be culturally insensitive, hinder communication, and create difficulty should you choose to learn the language in the future.Some expressions appropriated by the weeaboo community include:    Kawaii (かわいい) English statement + desu (です)  Variation: English + Japanese adjective + desu (です). For example: "I passed that exam so you know I'm kakkoii desu."   Suffixes like -kun (－くん) and -chan (－ちゃん)  Baka (ばか)  Sugoi (すごい)  Chibi (ちび)  Ne! (ね); , There are many positives to joining a group or subculture, but in-group bias isn't one.The automatic assumption that Japanese products are superior to others can be self isolatingand/or a mild form of delusion.Self-inquiry is a good way of diffusing weeaboo tendencies. If you can't identify the reason why something is better, chances are your preference is a matter of taste. Some questions to ask yourself:   Why do I like this Japanese product? What is different between the Japanese product and a similar, non-Japanese product? What makes the Japanese product better than a similar, non-Japanese product?  , Dress code and other social conventions telegraph group membership to others.There are socially appropriate places for you express your interest by wearing the same costume as your favorite character, like at an anime convention. Choosing daily clothing styled after anime characters is, in many cases, the hallmark of a weeaboo.   A single accessory or article of clothing from your costume can add flair to your daily outfit without appearing socially inaccessible to others.  You can meet new friends and boost your creative capacity through role-playing specific characters and fantastical scenarios,but don't let this come at the cost of your own development. Pretending to be something you are not, even if you are emulating something you admire, can lead to a mismatch between your outer self and inner feelings and cause potentially extreme consequences.Accept that your personality changes as a function of growth, as do preferences and beliefs. Even if you consider yourself a die-hard fan, respecting the potential for future change influences more moderate (and less weeaboo-like) behavior. Occasionally put aside instant gratification, including anime, manga, costume making, and online activities. Reevaluate personal goals and your place in your community.Are you happy with where you're at? Ignoring these in favor of Japanese cultural pursuits is considered evidence of a weeaboo.  

do not use weeaboo jargon.  do not abnormally prioritize things that are japanese.  do not alienate yourself through your choice in clothing.  do not neglect your authentic self.

 The simplest item to use would be a plastic identification card, license, credit card, or library card. These plastic cards are usually about 1 mm thick from front to back.A plastic card is probably the easiest item to use. Other items that are approximately 1 millimeter in length or width tend to be more difficult to work with, but may include a grain of salt or sand, 10 sheets of notebook paper stapled together, the thickness of one sheet of heavy printer paper, the thickness of a fingernail, the thickness of a grain or rice, and the thickness of a U.S. dime.  Lay the edge or line you plan on measuring down on a sheet of white or light colored paper. Try to keep the entire edge on the paper.   If desired, you can use a pencil to trace along the outside of the edge. This allows you to remove the object being measured and work only with a flat line, which can make measuring such small lengths easier. Doing so is only optional, however. The paper needs to be light in color. If it isn't, you might have difficulty seeing your marks.  Use a pencil to carefully mark a perpendicular line off one side of the edge you are measuring. This will become your starting edge.  Place the narrow 1-mm edge of your plastic card down on the paper, placing it directly next to your starting edge line. Draw another small mark with your pencil on the opposite side of the card.   Keep the mark as close to the outer edge of your card as possible. Note that you can use this procedure for any other estimation tool. It is not exclusive to plastic identification cards.  Shift the card so that it lies to the outside of your newly created mark, then draw another mark on the opposite side of the card again. Continue moving the card down the line in small increments like this, marking each one, until you reach the very end of the edge you are measuring.   Keep the card perpendicular to the line being measured the entire time you measure out the marks. Make sure that the ending edge of the line is also marked.  Remove the edge being measured and the card you are using the measure it. Count the gaps in between each line you marked. The number of gaps will give you your estimated number of millimeters.   Only count the gaps. Do not count the lines, since there will be one too many.  

find an item roughly 1 millimeter long.  place the object to be measured on a blank sheet of paper.  mark the starting edge.  place your measuring item at the starting edge.  move the measuring item down the full length.  count the gaps. 

 This should be the easy part, as people are always saying they want to 1v1 people to prove they are good at a game. Making an emblem or a clan tag that says 1v1? is an easy way to find players.; , This may be called Private Match depending on what Call of Duty you are playing. Edit the custom classes and restrict everything except the bolt action sniper rifles and perks. Turn the health to 30% and the kill cam off.   Some people like having a throwing knife or tomahawk in their class, as using it is considered equivalent to sniping and opponent. If you want to be able to trickshot last, you are going to need to leave some weapons on for trickshotting, or set up the preset classes to be able to trickshot.  The smallest maps in the game are used for 1v1ing, the list includes   Modern Warfare - Shipment World At War - Makin Modern Warfare 2 - Rust Black Ops - Nuketown Modern Warfare 3 - Dome Black Ops II - Nuketown 2025 Ghosts - Octane Advanced Warfare - Solar Black Ops III - Nuketown  , Most of the maps mentioned have a way of killing the enemy repeatedly as soon as they spawn. When you get the location and timing of when to shoot down, beating your opponent should be a breeze.  Have a piece of paper or an emblem that has your Win/Loss Ratio; it's no fun to play competitively if you don't have a way of knowing how good you are doing.  

find an opponent.  go into custom game.  choose your map.  spawntrap your enemy.  keep track of your record. 

 Curly hair can be prone to split-ends and dryness. But some home remedies can bring back your shine, reduce frizz, and make curly hair easier to manage. They can be less expensive than store-bought products, and fun to make.   Try a homemade rinse of eggs. Beat the eggs with curd and almond oil together before applying. Apple cider vinegar will reduce frizz as well as improving shine. Turn it into a rinse. Putting avocado into curly hair makes it easier to style. Mash one avocado with some yogurt to smear into your hair. Make sure to rinse it out, and shampoo. Try carbonated water to reduce the frizz, especially if you air dry your hair a lot, since air drying does expose hair to humidity. , Curly hair has more protein in it than straight hair. That means it needs more moisture too. You have to give it the moisture it's craving if you want it to look healthy and have bounce.   Leave-in conditioners are also effective for curly hair because it can become very dry. Once a week, lather on the deep-conditioning mask to give curly hair the moisture it needs. Don't use a mask too often or it will weigh down hair. , Sulfate-free shampoo works better on curly hair. Choosing a shampoo with the right chemical composition for curly hair matters. All hair follicles were not created equal.Regular shampoos have salt and detergent in them that are bad for curls. Shampoos with aloe or wheat protein are good choices. There are many shampoos that are designed specifically for curly hair. , Hairspray and some gels have a lot of alcohol, which doesn't work for curly hair. The alcohol can give hair a dull look and weigh it down, so pick your products carefully.   Choose gels that are water soluble instead. , You don't have to rinse out all of the conditioner. If you leave a little bit of the conditioner in your hair, it will look healthier. , Curly hair can be tamed with a variety of products, ranging from mousse to creams. These products sometimes make straight hair look limp, but they can make your curls seem more defined. Some estimates say people with curly hair often use as many as three products a day. Try to find one product that has multiple purposes.  

use home remedies.  use a deep-conditioning mask.  wash hair with the right shampoo.  avoid products with alcohol in them.  leave in some of your conditioner.  use styling products. 

 Whenever you plan to be active, it's important to be prepared and to be safe. An essential part of this is making sure you carry your medications with you.   Everyone with COPD will have some sort of emergency medication provided to them. Whether it's an inhaler or an oral medication, these can help relieve symptoms almost immediately.Have your emergency medications and an action plan with you at all times. Keep some in your car, at home, in your purse or briefcase and gym bag. You should be able to have access to these at all times. Don't leave home without them and definitely do not engage in any sort of activity without having them handy.  Your action plan should detail what you should do in a variety of situations. Knowing exactly what your symptoms are is an essential part of your action plan.Although you may know other people with COPD, everyone's disease plays out differently. Be certain you know exactly what your symptoms are and what you should do when you experience them. Symptoms to be aware of include: wheezing, difficulty breathing, chest tightness, coughing. If you experience these symptoms while being active, stop all activity and treat symptoms as directed by your physician.  Exercising with a friend is not only a fun way to be active, but can also help you feel a little safer and more comfortable while you exercise.   Those with COPD may feel nervous, scared or anxious about being active — even with daily or lifestyle activities. A flare up could cause symptoms which can be scary. To help reduce your anxiety and stress about this, consider asking a friend, family member or co-worker to exercise with you. Inform them of your condition and give them your action plan so they can help assist you if you experience a flare up of symptoms.  Since COPD affects your lungs, if you breathe in certain irritants, they can cause a flare up of your symptoms and make breathing very difficult.   When you're exercising, the increase in your heart rate and breathing pace can make you more susceptible to certain lung irritants. Irritants can include: dust, chemicals, pollution, fumes or cigarette smoke.Do not exercise or be active if you know there are any of these irritants near you. Stay indoors or choose another location to stay active.  Many times, people with COPD end up needing oxygen to help them breathe more easily. You will need to work closely with your doctor to discuss which oxygen tank fits your needs and how to be active when using it.   Although oxygen tanks can be cumbersome, that doesn't mean you cannot be active. Some are large and will make exercise or activity difficult; however, other tanks are just about 5 pounds, which makes them much more convenient.Consider choosing a larger tank to have when you're at home and also a smaller portable one for when you want to exercise or go out for the day. Make your oxygen more portable for you as well. Even if you have a larger tank, get a rolling cart, backpack or purse-like case for your oxygen. This makes it much easier to take along with you. Also be mindful of the tubing. Use a shorter tube when you're going to be out and about. Those longer tubes can get in the way and get caught on objects.  

carry emergency medications with you.  know your symptoms.  exercise with a friend.  avoid lung irritants.  find ways to be active with an oxygen tank. 

   Oak is probably the most popular quarter sawn timber. The ray flecks that oak reveals when it is quarter sawn are spectacular. Maple is another wood that displays an attractive appearance when it is quarter sawn.; , A 12-inch (30 cm) log will give you only a 4- to 5-inch (10 to 12.5 cm) sawn board at the widest.    The bark should be straight so the medullary rays are running straight to the middle of the tree from the outside. These rays are the ribbons that extend vertically through the tree perpendicular to the growth rings and which appear shiny. The rays at the end of the log should appear to be in a spoke-like pattern from the center. The longer and thicker they are, the more chance you have of hitting them when you saw. ,   Split out the pith (the soft spongy part located in the center of the log). If possible, remove the sapwood, which is the outer, lighter-colored wood. This is the part of the tree where water and sap flows. It contains moisture and will shrink when it dries. It also is more susceptible to fungus. ,, When you quarter saw, the saw actually splits the medullary ray. A quarter sawn board shows the annual rings mostly at right angles to the surface of the board, whereas a plain sawn board has rings aligned to the surface.  

select a type of wood that is suitable for quarter sawing.  determine what size log is needed to yield the right size of boards.  look at the characteristics of the log to tell if it is going to produce good quarter sawn lumber.  cut the log into quarters.  ,  remove the portions of the log that are not good for woodworking.  run one side of each quarter over a jointer to get it flat and smooth.  ,  place each quartered section on the saw carriage, which holds the log while it is being sawn, so that the annual rings of growth are between 75 and 90 degrees to the face of the resulting boards.  ,  saw the quarters so that the rays are perpendicular to the face of the board.

 A lot of the time squinting is caused by the amount of light we are taking in. If you are able, adjust the brightness settings of available light sources. For example, change the type of bulb in your office or home to a lower wattage.   It may be difficult to change the lighting in your office so it is best to consult your immediate supervisor or the Human Resources Department before attempting to make any changes yourself. If you are squinting when reading an electronic device, check the settings if it is possible to adjust the brightness settings. For example, televisions and mobile phones can easily be adjusted within the settings menu.  The most common reason for squinting is due to the brightness of the sunshine. If you are squinting outside on a bright sunny day, a pair of quality sunglasses may solve or reduce the problem. Research what brands offer as some brands focus on fashion while others on function.   Make sure the glasses block at least 99% of ultraviolet (UV) rays. Budget how much you are willing to spend on sunglasses as some can reach upwards of $500. If you are liable to lose them, think about choosing a pair of sunglasses that fit within your means. If you are more active, choose a pair of sunglasses that won’t fly off your face easily. You can also purchase accessories to keep them in place or to turn your everyday glasses into sunglasses by simply clipping onto the frame.  The brim of a hat or visor provides temporary shade by cutting the amount of light entering into your eyes. Choose a hat or visor that’s comfortable and suits your style. A baggy hat may fly off when windy; in contrast, a hat that is too small may cut off circulation and cause you discomfort.   Many hats can be adjusted or come in different sizes. Make sure you choose one right for your head shape. Some athletic hats are made of breathable material that wicks sweat away from the body, which may be a wise choice for humid climates or if you are prone to sweating a lot.  Many individuals who play sports outdoors or under bright stadium lights use eye black to reduce glare. Apply black strips or black grease underneath each eye to help reduce squinting. Be careful when using grease and make sure not to let it stain clothes or furniture as it may be hard to clean.Football players and baseball players famously apply this under their eyes so watch a game or research pictures for the correct way to apply eye black.  

adjust the light of the room.  wear sunglasses.  wear a hat or visor.  use eye black.

 If you are interested in becoming a monk, your first step is to visit a monastery. For the most part, monasteries are open to visits from potential devotees. Some will allow you to stay for a few days at a time. On these visits, you will learn about the daily routine at the monastery, as well as what is expected of the monks.Some monasteries offer guesthouse accommodations to outsiders who agree to follow certain rules, such as observing curfews and periods of silence. You may want to consider a monastic retreat, in which you will take part in the daily routine of the monastery.  After you have visited a monastery and decided that you’d like to devote yourself to this life, you can express your interest in becoming a novice, and move into the monastery. This is practice, sometimes called an “observership,” is your first step toward becoming a Christian monk. As a novice, you will be taught every aspect of the monkhood. Meanwhile, the monks will observe you to decide if your personality is suitable for monastic life.Depending on the order, there may be more than one level of novicehood. This process can take up to one year, again depending on the order.  After you have passed your novicehood, you may be asked to become a postulate, or intended monk. At this stage, you may be given more responsibility at the monastery. Likewise, the expectations set for you will be higher. This stage provides a deeper experience by which you will decide that this vocation is right for you, as well as to prove yourself to the other monks., As a postulate, you will be asked to take “temporary vows,” committing you to the lifestyle and beliefs of monastic life, for as long as you remain within the monastery. These vows will vary depending on the specific order, however they will almost certainly involve a deep devotion to God, a celibate disposition, and the rejection of material belongings., After your time as a postulate, you will eventually be invited to join the monastery for good. You will be ordained as a Christian monk, and you will take permanent monastic vows. 

visit a monastery.  become a novice.  become a postulate.  take temporary vows.  make your final commitment to monastic life. 

 Older gas ovens have a drawer at the bottom of the oven that contains the broiling unit. This compartment is commonly called the “broiler drawer.” If your oven doesn’t have a broiler drawer, the broiler is inside the main oven compartment. In this case, the broiling unit in will be attached to the top of the oven interior.; , Most recipes ask you to place the rack 3-4 inches (7.5 to 10 centimeters) away from the broiler. To do so, move the oven rack to one of the top two rack positions. Use a ruler to measure the distance from the rack to the top of the oven. If you’re oven has a broiler drawer, you will not be able to adjust the shelf height.  If you have a gas oven, the broil setting will be the last setting on the temperature dial. Depending on the model, an electric oven can have a “broil” button or a broil option on the temperature dial. To turn on the broiler, simply press the “broil” button or turn dial all the way to the word “broil.” Some newer electric ovens have several broiling settings. If the recipe doesn’t specify a temperature, use the highest setting., Close the broiler drawer or oven door. Let the oven preheat for at least five minutes before cooking any food.Some meat recipes will call for longer preheating times to help sear the surface of the meat.  Avoid putting glass or Pyrex dishes under your broiler. These materials may crack or explode when exposed to the high temperatures in a broiler.Instead, use sturdy metal or cast iron pans.For example:   Cast iron pans are usually preheated with the broiler. These pans are great for searing meat. Metal baking sheets can be lined with foil and used to broil toast or vegetables. Slotted broiling pans have an extra tray underneath that circulates heat and catches draining fat. These trays can be used for any kind of food.  This method only applies to gas ovens. Once the broiler is on, look inside the oven to find the flames. When you place food in the oven, try to center it directly underneath these flames.Electric ovens use heated coils instead of flames to broil food. These coils are usually evenly distributed along the top of the oven.  Leaving the oven door or broiler drawer slightly open will allow air and heat to circulate evenly. However, not all oven units will operate with an open door. Check your oven’s manufacturer manual to find out.If you have small children in your home, leave the oven door or broiler drawer closed to avoid any accidents.  Broilers use high temperatures to quickly sear food. Therefore, most recipes only ask you to broil food for 5-10 minutes. If you leave the food in too long, it could burn or even catch on fire.This is especially true for dry foods such as toast. If your food catches on fire:   Turn off the broiler. Leave the oven door or drawer closed. If the door is open, close it. This will cut off the oxygen supply to the fire. Let the fire burn out on its own. Open a window to ventilate any smoke. Keep an eye on your oven. If the fire gets bigger or the flames start coming out of your oven, evacuate your home and call your local emergency hotline., First, place a cast iron skillet in the broiler. Preheat the oven and the skillet for 15-20 minutes. Next, place a seasoned steak in the hot cast-iron skillet. Broil the steak for three to five minutes per side. After the steak is cooked, let it rest for at least five minutes before serving it.Season the steak by brushing it with olive oil and sprinkling on a layer of salt and pepper. Let the steak come to room temperature on your counter before cooking it., Cut a loaf of French bread into large pieces about 1-2 inches (2.5-5 centimeters) thick. Next, spread a liberal amount of seasoned butter onto each slice. Place the bread on a foil-wrapped baking sheet and broil it for 5 minutes. Keep a close eye on the bread to make sure it doesn’t burn. Create a savory seasoned butter by combining:   5 tablespoons of softened butter 2 teaspoons of extra virgin olive oil 3 cloves of crushed garlic 1 teaspoon of dried oregano salt and pepper to taste, This method of cooking softens vegetables while giving them a smoky, charred flavor. First, toss thinly chopped vegetables in olive oil and sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Next, place them on a foil lined baking sheet and broil them for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring them every five minutes.This method works for many vegetables, including:   Carrots Bell peppers Onions Zucchini Potatoes  , Use your broiler to add a golden baked finish to the top of your casseroles. First, cook your favorite casserole in the oven. Once it’s almost done cooking, place it under the broiler. Broil the casserole for three to five minutes before removing it to cool.Let the casserole cool for five to ten minutes before eating it.  

find the broiler.  arrange the oven rack.  turn on the broiler.  preheat the oven.  use the right pans.  align your food underneath the flame.  leave the door cracked.  monitor your food closely.  broil a steak.  toast garlic bread.  grill sliced veggies.  finish casseroles in the broiler. 

 Then open the monitor and go to CAM 2B (West Hall Corner) and flip the monitor up and down until you see a poster of a close-up of Golden Freddy's face.   Note that this method does not work on Android devices.; , You'll see Golden Freddy sitting in front of you.  If you want him to kill you, just leave him there for a few seconds, but opening the monitor is the only way (besides completing a night) for him to disappear.  

start a night.  close the monitor when you see the poster.  flip up the monitor. 

 You will need twenty plastic party cups altogether. Classic red party cups are most often used. Arrange ten cups in pyramid form on each end of the table. The row closest to you has four cups, and the last row that is closest to the middle of the table has only one cup. A regulation beer pong table is seven to eight feet in length and two feet wide, though you can use any type of table that is fairly long.The cups are usually 16 or 18 ounce cups. Red party cups can be purchased at most supermarkets and package stores.; , You will need to partially fill the cups with beer, or any other liquid that you want to use. Water can be used for a non-alcoholic game. Typically, two 12oz beers should be enough to fill ten cups. More or less can be used depending on how much you want to drink. The cups need to be filled with beer because each cup that is scored on is supposed to be consumed and then set aside.Fill the cups about a ¼ of the way full. Set up a cup filled only with water on the side of the table to clean off balls that fall on the floor or get dirty.  A game can be played with one player, or two players on each team. Don’t have any more than two players on each team. If playing with two players on each team, each team plays with two balls instead of one., Determine who gets first shot by doing an eye-to-eye challenge. One opponent from each team looks the other player in the eyes and throw the balls towards each other’s cups. The balls are shot until one player sinks the ball in the opponent’s cup, and the other player misses. If playing in teams, switch partners until one partner succeeds in making the cup. The team that wins the eye-to-eye challenge gets the first throw in the game.Do not remove the cup if it is scored on. Just remove the ball, wash it, and begin playing the game.  Take turns throwing the ping pong ball into each other’s cups. Drink the contents of the cup and remove it each time a ball makes it into the cup. Continue doing this until all of the cups are gone. The winner is the first to eliminate all of the other team’s cups.The game is automatically won if members of the same team sink the ball into the same cup of the opposing team. The winning team typically gets to stay on the table and take on a new team for the next game.  A common is rule is that elbows must stay behind the edge of the table when making a shot. In some games, the wrist is included in this rule. The shot does not count if it was made with elbows beyond the outer edge of the table. If the shot is made with elbows over the table, then the ball must be returned and the shot needs to be made again.This rule can be broken for shorter players, or players with poor throwing skills if it is agreed upon by everyone playing.  A re-rack, or reformation of cups, is allowed twice per game. Re-racking can happen when 6,4,3, or 2 cups are left. You can ask for formations like a square, or a triangle. The last cup left in the game is always available to be moved and centered, however, even if the two re-racks have already been used.If you are doing really well, try to save your re-racks for later in the game. For example: Rather than using them on six and four cups and have them scattered try to save your re-racks for four and three (or even two) cups so, at the end of the game, the cups are closer to each other. You can also ask to fix the cups at any point during them game. This is not the same as re-racking. Asking to fix the cups only allows for cups to be tightened up, or returned to position if they have been moved.  If you bounce a ball on the table and it lands in a cup, you can ask for another cup to be removed along with the cup the ball was sunk in. It is your choice which additional cup is removed. Note that if you do choose to bounce the ball, the other team has the right to swat it out of the way and vice versa. Players can not protest a ball that has been swatted out of the way during an attempted bounce shot.It is best to wait to attempt bounce shot when your opponent is down to their last cups. Try to make a bounce shot when the other team appears to be distracted.  “On fire” can’t be called out unless “heating up” was called out first. Once “on fire” has been called out the player can continue making shots until he or she misses.Make sure the other team is aware of you calling out “heating up” and “on fire.”  , You are allowed once per game to call out a cup that is not touching any other cup. You can call out this cup by saying “island” or “solo.” If the ball is sunk in the called out cup, then the player can ask for an additional cup to be pulled out along with the other cup. If the player calls out a specific, isolated cup and hits another, then the cup that was accidentally hit must remain on the table.A lonely cup is not one that slid slightly away from the other cups due to wetness. It is isolated because other cups around it has been removed.  A death cup is a cup that has been removed from the rack, or formation, and is currently in the player’s hand. This cup is eligible to be shot at by the opposing team. If the ball is made into the death cup, the game is automatically over. Three cups can be removed for a death cup that is still on the table and not in the player’s hand.Drink the cup as fast as possible to avoid shots being made at it. Wait for the other team to be distracted when trying to make a death cup.  Once a team has won, the losing team has a shot at rebuttal. To do this, each player of the losing team makes a shot at the opposing team’s remaining cups until someone misses. If cups still remain, the game is over. If all of the cups have been hit, then the game goes into overtime. Overtime consists of each team making a pyramid out of three cups and shooting until no cups remain on the losing team’s side.No re-racks are allowed during overtime, but cups can be fixed.  Always wet the ball before shooting. This will increase its accuracy and will help it glide through the air more smoothly. A dry ball will go a shorter distance and can be harder to aim.   Clean it in the water cup before every shot.  Form is key when preparing to shoot. Whichever hand you shoot with, that foot is in front. The opposite foot is set up further back for support. Make your elbows will not go over the edge of the table, and practice your aim before you shoot.  When you release the ball, there are three main types of shots. There is an arc shot, where the ball is released higher and drops into a cup. A fastball shot is when a quick, direct shot is made at the cup. And there is a bounce shot, which is bounced on the table before dropping in the cup.Fastballs shots are sometimes not allowed because they can get out of hand.  Always keep your eye on the table to avoid a sneaky shot being aimed at you. You can use the others teams moment of distraction to your advantage. One technique is to pretend like you are not paying attention. While the other team is shooting, you can look away or start talking to someone on the sidelines.  If a ball is spinning on the rim of the cup and hasn’t dropped in yet, you can blow or take the ball out with your finger. The rule typically calls for girls to blow on the ball and for guys to take it out with their finger. As long as the ball doesn’t hit the beer, it will not count as a shot if it comes out.For girls, when the ball is spinning around, you are allowed to blow into the cup to force the ball out. Put your face near the cup and blow on the ball as hard as you can. For guys, while it’s spinning, reach in with your finger and try to get under the ball. You have to be fast. Put your finger under the ball and pull out it quickly.  

arrange ten cups on a long table.  fill the cups with beer.  pick teams.  decide who goes first.  take turns throwing the ping pong balls.  keep elbows behind the edges of the table.  re-rack twice per game.  bounce the ball.  call out “heating up.” a player that makes two shots in a row calls out “heating up.” call out “on fire” when three shots have been made in a row.  shoot for the lonely cup.  shooting for the death cup.  asking for a rebuttal.  prepare the ball.  get in correct stance.  practice your shots.  be alert at all times.  blow on or spin the ball. 

 That's code for grabbing your cutting board, knife and veggies. /images/thumb/a/aa/Make-Cream-Spinach-Step-5-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Make-Cream-Spinach-Step-5-preview-Version-2.jpg /images/thumb/a/aa/Make-Cream-Spinach-Step-5-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Make-Cream-Spinach-Step-5-preview-Version-2.jpg          Cut the onion in half. Make vertical slices very close together. Then, rotate it and cut it the other way to dice it. Mince your garlic finely. Once you think it's small enough, do it a teeny bit more.  Put in 1 stick of butter over medium-low heat. If your stove runs a bit colder, put it on medium. /images/thumb/9/94/Make-Cream-Spinach-Step-6-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Make-Cream-Spinach-Step-6-preview-Version-2.jpg /images/thumb/9/94/Make-Cream-Spinach-Step-6-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Make-Cream-Spinach-Step-6-preview-Version-2.jpg          Once the butter is melted, add in 8 tablespoons (90 g) of flour. Immediately start whisking and cook for five minutes. It should turn golden brown. Add garlic and onions to your roux. Stir together to combine and cook for another minute. Slowly add in 2 cups (475 ml) of milk. Whisk constantly. Cook it for 5 more minutes, stirring occasionally. It should start to thicken.  If you have another pair of hands at your disposal, make him or her whisk the cream sauce while you do the spinach. /images/thumb/e/e5/Make-Cream-Spinach-Step-7-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Make-Cream-Spinach-Step-7-preview-Version-2.jpg /images/thumb/e/e5/Make-Cream-Spinach-Step-7-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Make-Cream-Spinach-Step-7-preview-Version-2.jpg          Put 3 tablespoons of butter into a pot and let it melt. Throw in as much of the spinach as you can. As it heats, it will shrivel and shrink and you'll be able to add more. This may take a few additions. Stir it well, flipping it to cook it evenly. You want to stop cooking the spinach when it’s completely wilted but not mushy and overcooked. Grab a leaf from the pan and give 'er a taste test. It should be cooked and wilted, but still have a tiny bit of crunch to it.  By now it should be thick like gravy. /images/thumb/9/94/Make-Cream-Spinach-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Make-Cream-Spinach-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg /images/thumb/9/94/Make-Cream-Spinach-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Make-Cream-Spinach-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg          Spoon the spinach into the cream. Stir it gently to entirely incorporate the greens into the creaminess. Try it before you deem it too creamy or to vegetable-y. Also, if you want to spice it up, add some cayenne. Then serve!  , /images/thumb/a/ac/Make-Cream-Spinach-Step-9-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Make-Cream-Spinach-Step-9-preview-Version-2.jpg /images/thumb/a/ac/Make-Cream-Spinach-Step-9-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Make-Cream-Spinach-Step-9-preview-Version-2.jpg

 When you love someone, immediately you want to introduce them to your friends. When you do introduce them, ask your friends for their honest opinions about your love interest. Your friends might be able to be more objective than you and help you identify whether you seem in love or merely infatuated.   It’s important before embarking on a new relationship to have at least some approval from your friends. Your friends know you and care about you, and it’s a red flag if everyone but you is skeptical of your new love.; , As with your friends, your family can help you discern whether your crush is a good fit for you and whether what you’re experiencing is love. Love builds you up and is long-lasting. Lust or a passing crush fades, and your family can help you tell the difference.   Ask your parents, grandparents, or aunts and uncles how they knew that they found the right person. Their unique stories might help you get a better understanding of whether your own situation is love or something else.  When being around this person makes you want to be the best person you can be, it is a sign of love.   For example, if this person makes you want to better yourself by working out or taking up a mutual hobby that interests both of you, it’s a sign that you love them. Wanting to improve yourself for someone often means that you love them. Note that this is not the same as loving someone who is trying to change you into someone you’re not. It’s healthy to want to better yourself to be the best possible partner for someone you love. It’s a red flag if someone you love is trying to force you to change instead of loving you for you.  When you accidentally hurt someone you love, you will apologize and mean it. If you don’t really love the person, your apology might feel half-hearted. Truly wanting forgiveness and meaning it when you apologize is a sign that this person means a lot to you and you’re in love., Once you’re past the initial “crush” phase, if you find that you can be yourself around this person, that’s a good sign that you’re in love. When you can let down your guard and that person still accepts you as you are, you can be confident that you’re in love.If you feel comfortable enough to leave your makeup at home or wear pajamas for a movie night, for example, that’s a sign that you’re comfortable being yourself in the relationship and secure with your love.  

ask your friends for feedback.  be sure your family likes them.  be a better person because of them.  apologize and mean it.  be yourself around them. 

 Create files for personal work, schoolwork/homework/projects/assignments and especially for presentations that you must give during meetings, speeches, ceremonies etc. This way you will find what you need when you need it, and quickly too.; , Once again, make it obvious which files are to be used for any meeting that you attend. Always have a folder that you know off-by-heart to go to for presentation files. No mess, no fuss, no panic. , Get out of the habit of simply loading information on to your memory stick and letting it go stale there. Sort regularly and remove the unneeded to free up space. Put things in their proper place for fast retrieval. And every now and then, wipe it clean when everything on it has stale dated.  

create folders in the same manner as you would on a computer.  create folders for each subject or area of work.  it's up to you but you can select to organise your files by name.  ,  keep this up as a habit. 

, It's that simple! Few examples:  The 4th number in the Fibonacci Sequence is the sum of the 3rd and 2nd numbers. i.e. 3 = 2 + 1       The 7th number in the Fibonacci Sequence is the sum of the 6th and 5th numbers. i.e. 13 = 8 + 5       The 11th number in the Fibonacci Sequence is the sum of the 10th and 9th numbers. i.e. 89 = 55 + 34        , For example, consider generating first 6 terms of the Fibonacci Sequence. The steps are as follows:  Write the first two terms -> 1, 1       Generate the 3rd term by adding the 2nd and 1st terms i.e. 3rd term = 1 + 1 = 2       Generate the 4th term by adding the 3rd and 2nd terms i.e. 4th term = 2 + 1 = 3       Generate the 5th term by adding the 4th and 3rd terms i.e. 5th term = 3 + 2 = 5       Generate the 6th term by adding the 5th and 4th terms i.e. 6th term = 5 + 3 = 8        

note that the first two numbers in the fibonacci sequence are same: 1 and 1.;  ,  any other number in the fibonacci sequence is the sum of the two immediately preceding numbers.  in a different situation, say you need to write a particular number of terms in the fibonacci sequence. 

 Azaleas are popularly grown in the Southeastern US, since they do well with mild winters and long summers. Azaleas are hardy plants that don't need much in the way of accommodations. Different types of azaleas have slightly different needs, so pay attention to what type you pick out to ensure you'll be satisfied with the results.   Azaleas are available in two main classes: native azaleas, which grow like vines and don't need pruning, and Asian azaleas, which grow as shrubs. Asian azaleas are available in two varieties, both of which are evergreen:   Kurume hybrids. These are bright red and keep well-contained in one area. They can be planted in containers, raised beds or directly in the ground, and won't get larger than 3 or 4 feet (0.9 or 1.2 m) tall. They don't require much maintenance.  Southern Indian hybrids, on the other hand, grow very tall and large. They come in many colors, notably hot pink and white, and can easily grow tall enough to cover a window or door. If you have a lot of space, this might be a good choice for you, but you'll have to prune from time to time.   The Azalea Society or your local nursery can make recommendations on the type of azalea to plant in your area. There are hybrid descriptions and examples online or in local garden and landscaping shops. Stick with one type of azalea, or incorporate several different colors and species into the garden for variety.; , Find a place in the garden or yard with some shade - "dappled shade," as many azalea enthusiasts term it. This particular mix of shade and sunlight is perfect for azaleas. If you plant them in full sunlight, they won't grow as well. According to the Azalea Society of America, azaleas bloom well when planted under shady trees.   There are deciduous azalea varieties that do well with full sun, so check into these if you don't have much shade available.  Azaleas need soil that drains very well, rather than retaining water after a rain. To determine whether the soil drains well where you want to plant your azalea, dig a hole before it rains, then check back afterward. If the hole is filled with standing water, the soil doesn't drain well; it's likely highly composed of clay. If the water is gone, the soil should be fine for azaleas.   If the soil doesn't drain well, you can mix it with compost or other organic matter in order to loosen it up. Till it to a depth of several feet to break it up, then mix in the other well-draining matter. Another option is to plant your azalea in a pot or a raised bed, where you can control the soil drainage more easily., Azaleas prefer a slightly acidic soil, such as a pH 5.5 or pH 6. If a soil test reveals an alkaline soil, mix some sulfur into the dirt before planting to balance it.  Use a garden shovel to dig a hole in the dirt deep enough to cover the root and bottom of the plant. Dig a few inches wider than the ball of the root, and set the azalea upright in the hole so that the top of the root ball is slightly above the surface of the ground. Drop soil into the hole around the plant. Spread it around and under the azalea, and lightly pat it into place with your fingertips.   Wet the azalea before planting. Dip the root ball in a bucket of water, or use a hose to lightly dampen it, before setting the azalea into the ground.If you are planting more than one azalea, make sure the holes are space several feet apart.  Water the plant and the soil slowly and thoroughly. Water again the day after planting. The plants must be watered at least once per week, unless they are in direct sunlight, in which case they must be watered more frequently. Take care not to let the azalea dry out, or it will wither.  Use pine bark, pine needles, sawdust or wood chips between the bushes. This will keep the soil moist and the temperature of the dirt even. Mulch will also help keep out weeds.  If your soil is rich and acid, you won't need to fertilize often. If you do choose to fertilize, do it in spring, right after the azalea blooms. Use an acid forming fertilizer like cottonseed meal, or choose a special azalea fertilizer.   Improper fertilizing can cause the plant to bloom at the wrong time, so be sure to fertilize only if required.  Pruning azalea plants early will allow the plant's energy to be directed toward producing new growth. Assess your azalea to find dead branches and other spots that need trimming. Use a pair of hand clippers to thin the azaleas. Clip out any dead branches.   Don't go overboard with this early-season pruning. Each healthy branch you cut away is a branch that could have produced beautiful spring flowers. If you want to drastically change the shape of your azalea, wait until later in the summer.  Now is the time to reshape your azalea shrub if you wish. Cut long, stray shoots next to woody branches to retain the azalea's natural form. Trim back areas that seem too crowded to promote air flow and improve the look of the bush. Be sure you make careful cuts - don't use hedge clippers to trim the bush willy nilly.   Don't prune too late in the year. Prune no later than 3 weeks after the blooms have gone - otherwise, you'll be cutting away next year's flower growth.  If you have an azalea that has grown to large proportions and you're ready to cut it back, you can safely cut it to within a foot of the ground and it will grow back bushy and beautiful. Do it after the blooms of spring have faded, so the plant has time to reestablish itself before the next phase of growth.  

pick the right azalea for your garden.  choose a shady planting spot.  make sure the soil drains well.  determine the soil's acidity.  dig a hole and plant the azalea.  water the azalea plant.  mulch the area around azalea plants after the blooms fade.  fertilize the azalea if required.  trim away dead branches in the spring.  do a light pruning after the blooms fade.  do a drastic pruning when necessary. 

 Understanding vocabulary and grammar rules will prove vital to learning English, and will require you to emphasize memorization practices when first starting out.

If you have a friend who is also learning English, make of point of studying together. Even if they are more advanced, you can learn a lot from a peer who already went through experiences and struggles that you’re having.   Languages can be challenging to learn. Having the comradery of a friend to join you in the learning process can help even if you don’t formally work on coursework or materials together. Simply maintaining a basic conversation with a friend is one of the best ways to study a new language. If you’re in a class together, check each other’s homework.

Having quick access to someone who may be able to answer questions will speed up your studying and make it more enjoyable. Sooner than later, they’ll have questions for you too!  , English arguably has the most words of any language, which means that there are often multiple words that give almost the same meaning. Even if a word is a synonym for another word, that does not mean the two words are interchangeable. Subtle differences in word meanings can make a big difference when you use the words.   For example, the words emaciated and thin have similar meanings, but you would not use them interchangeably. Emaciated indicates that someone looks so thin that she seems unhealthy, while slim implies that one looks thin, yet still attractive and healthy.Check the definition of synonyms before you decide to use them. This will help you to deepen your understanding of the English language while expanding your vocabulary as well.  Inconsistent ways of spelling certain sounds can make learning English a bit frustrating. When you’re having trouble with a certain word, look at how it's spelled in other forms. This may even frustrate you further for a moment – but it will remind you that there are plenty of exceptions to English spelling rules, and you need to recognize this to master English.   For example, some words feature silent letters, such as "knife" and "honor.”There are also rules for vowel order in some cases, such as “i” before “e” most of the time- (but not always!) and replace the “y” and add “ies” for plural words.  Verbs can also be challenging when you are trying to learn English. There are many verbs in the English language that have similar meanings, but the meaning of a sentence can be quite different depending on the one you choose.For example, “May I?” and “Can I?” have different (yet similar) meanings. “May” indicates that you are politely asking permission to do something, while “can” indicates that you are inquiring about whether or not something is possible. Make sure that you familiarize yourself with common verbs to avoid making these types of mistakes.  In spoken English, many words are not pronounced the same way even if they are spelled the same way. This means that you may end up making some mistakes with pronunciation now and then.   For example, the words “bough,” “tough,” and “cough” all end in the same four letters, but each word is pronounced differently. 

develop your vocabulary and grammar with flashcards.  label items in your home with sticky notes.  try duolingo.  get materials from the guardian teacher network.  study for a focused amount of time every day.  study with a friend.  watch for synonyms.  memorize odd spelling.  identify subtle differences in verbs.  remember that spelling can be misleading. 

 A walk is often a great way to rid the mind of stressors and provide a relaxing time to reflect. Being out in open air can often refresh people and it gives them exercise which can create endorphins (which help boost your mood). If your girlfriend is feeling down, go on a walk with her and allow her to vent if she needs to, or talk about things that will help distract her., Nothing can lighten a heavy mood more than laughter. Crack some jokes around your girlfriend that you know she would laugh at. If she's feeling especially down, she may have a hard time laughing, so just keep on trying until you get her to crack a smile. Don't make light of whatever she is experiencing, but throw in some humor that is completely unrelated to her circumstances.Sometimes the bad jokes are the best jokes to make someone cheer up. Tell your girlfriend a "dad joke" or something really corny. She may laugh out of the fact that he joke is so bad or pitiful.  Sometimes when people are upset, they just need some time to be lazy and veg out. If you and your girlfriend have some extended time together, ask her if she wants to watch her favorite show. Grab some popcorn, snacks, and candy and spend hours in front of the tv.   Sometimes this is a good approach to cheer someone up for the time being, but it doesn't always help in the end. After you have indulged in hours of tv, consider doing something that will refresh and revitalize you. Go on a run or take a walk outside for some fresh air and exercise.  This is a great way to distract your girlfriend from any hurt or pain she may be feeling, and it will give her a fun night. Take her to her favorite dance place, whether that's country western dancing, salsa dancing, swing dancing, or dancing in a club. Spend a few hours there and help her let go and just enjoy her night.Even if you're not a very good dancer, your girlfriend will appreciate your effort and will be able to take her mind off things for a little while. If you don't want the sole responsibility of dancing with her, consider inviting some of your mutual friends so that she has a group to dance with.  This may seem like a strange time to take on a new task, but if you girlfriend has been upset about something for a long time, it could be good to introduce something new into her life. Choose a hobby or skill that you both are interested in, and begin learning and perfecting it. Learning something new will be a good way to distract her and provide something fun in her life.   Maybe your girlfriend has always wanted to learn how to play a certain instrument, wants to take up cycling, or is interested in gardening. Be by her side as you two learn this new hobby and support her in it. If she seems uninterested in learning something new, encourage her slowly. Don't force her to pick up a hobby, but slowly show her how good it can be for her. Start learning the new skill or hobby on your own and share your experience with her. This may motivate her to join you.  If your girlfriend is feeling especially stressed about something, or something that has upset her has made her body tense, a massage is a great way to ease her mood. By helping her to relax her body, you may be helping her to relax her mind as well. Ask her first if she wants a massage and then work out any tension in her muscles.As you do this you might consider playing some soft music so that she can fully rest and relax. She may just need to keep her mind off things for a while, so a comforting massage and peaceful music may just be the trick.  Food is always a great way to distract someone or cheer them up. Very few people can resist their favorite dish or dessert, so try taking your girlfriend on a night out to her favorite restaurant. Let her order and eat whatever she wants. She may just need a night to indulge and veg, so be by her side and veg with her.   Some people lose their appetite when they are upset about something. If your girlfriend seems really upset about something, ask her first if she is up for going out. She may just need a night in or time to herself, so do whatever will suit her best.  If your girlfriend doesn't seem up for going out and just needs a night in, prepare her favorite dinner -- and dessert! Surprise her with a delicious meal when she comes home from work or school. If your girlfriend enjoys cooking, ask her if she wants to cook along with you. It may be a good distraction for her., What girl doesn't get cheered up by holding puppies? Find your local pet or puppy store and take her there for an hour or so, so that she can love on some puppies and they can love on her back., Think about the things in your girlfriend's life that she enjoys or mean a lot to her. Maybe she really likes a certain band, or has been wanting a specific piece of jewelry or clothing for a while. Surprise her with a special gift on a day when she's feeling especially gloomy.   You can also take her shopping, so that she can pick out some things herself. Spending a few hours with her at her favorite stores can go a long way, and it will likely help cheer her up, especially if she finds something she likes.  Instead of just going on a short date, plan an entire day with your girlfriend. Try to incorporate some of her favorite things and also some things that will refresh her. Plan a picnic or spend some time at the beach. Go to an amusement park for some exciting rides. Visit some touristy areas in your town.  

go on a walk together.  make her laugh.  watch a marathon of her favorite show with her.  go out dancing.  learn a new skill together.  offer to give her a massage.  take her to her favorite restaurant.  make her dinner.  take her to a puppy store.  buy her a special gift.  plan a special day together. 

 Bring your hot water temperature down to 120 degrees Fahrenheit (48.9 degrees Celsius) if it is set higher than that. Hot water heaters can usually be adjusted with a valve. Setting a limit on the hot water can prevent you, or your children, from being scalded by turning the hot water up too high., Cranking on the faucet and jumping into the shower can result in scalding your skin. Wait a minute or so to allow the temperature to heat up, and adjust it before stepping in.   Remind children not to adjust the taps by themselves, but rather to ask an adult for help. Turning the handle may seem fun to a child as they may be unaware that the water can get too hot and could burn or scald them.Never leave a child unattended in the bathtub. Monitor the child as well as the water to ensure it does not get too hot. , Make sure hot drinks and liquids are not placed on the edge of tables or counters. , This will ensure that no one is scalded by food or drinks that are too hot.   Be especially cautious when serving children. Never heat a baby bottle in the microwave, as it may warm unevenly and develop “hot spots” that could scald a child’s mouth. 

ensure your hot water isn’t too hot.  test the water temperature before getting into the tub or shower.  never carry or pass a hot drink or liquid over a person's head.  test the temperature of food and drinks before serving. 

 Shampoo certainly removes grease, but it can strip away too much of your hair's protective oil, leaving your hair dry and vulnerable to damage. If you hair breaks easily or quickly develops split ends, you may already be shampooing too often. Find a washing schedule that leaves your hair healthy and soft, so you can address the greasiness without destroying your hair.   You might be able to wash daily if you have very fine hair, live in a humid area, or exercise daily to the point of heavy sweating. For most people, washing once every 2–4 days is recommended. You may need to wash even less often if you have extra-curly African hair, or if you've treated your hair with keratin.Your hair will produce oil at the same rate, no matter how often you shampoo.; , Find a shampoo intended for oily or greasy hair. The most effective examples tend to include sulfates, which are infamous in some circles for the damage they can cause to skin and hair.Give it a try, but switch to a sulfate-free product if the shampoo irritates your skin or swings your hair too far in the dry, damaged direction.   If you can't find an effective, safe shampoo, you might be able to replace shampoo entirely with one of the home remedies below. Avoid products that advertise "added shine," which is caused by oily ingredients.  Dry shampoo is a scented powder that sits in your hair and absorbs grease, without rinsing away all your protective oils. Hold the can at least 6 inches (15 cm) away from your hair, and spray lightly onto the roots and mid-shafts in oily areas. Let sit for two minutes, then massage it into your hair with clean hands. Apply whenever your hair feels greasy, about 1–3 times between washes.Too much dry shampoo can cause white buildup. Apply lightly and to oily areas only (typically the layers of hair nearest to your scalp). Dry shampoo is available in powder form as well as sprays. Choose this if you are sensitive to fragrance or aerosols. Baking soda, talcum powder and other powders are also effective for absorbing grease.  Conditioner is designed to make your hair soft and silky, which is a short step from greasy. Only use it immediately after shampooing, when your hair is at its driest, and stick to a dollop the size of a small coin. Rub it into the ends of your hair only, as your roots are slick enough on their own.   To reduce the amount of conditioner even further, lightly apply a spray-on, leave-in conditioner instead.Surprisingly, a co-wash (using conditioner instead of shampoo) does actually remove some oil, though not as much as shampoo.However, co-washing is mainly beneficial for dry hair. Shampoo is a safer bet for someone with grease issues.  Unsurprisingly, hair grease and its gel and mousse cousins won't do you any favors in the fight against oil. Stick to light products only, such as texturizing sprays. If you bust out the mousse for a special occasion, be sure to wash it out at the end of the day.  Clarifying shampoos are extra-powerful products that strip out buildup from hair products. Because these are harsh enough to damage hair, use this once every 2nd to 4th wash.Never use clarifying shampoo on color treated hair, which will likely fade and may be vulnerable to damage.  Many people with dandruff often think the problem is dry skin. Actually, dandruff can be triggered by an overproduction of sebum, or scalp oil.If you have dandruff, treat it with dandruff shampoo according to label instructions.   There are several types of dandruff shampoo. If your dandruff doesn't decrease after a few uses, switch to one with a different active ingredient, or visit your doctor for a prescription-strength treatment.  

decide on a shampoo schedule.  choose your shampoo.  embrace dry shampoo.  apply conditioner with caution.  reduce use of hair products.  resort to clarifying shampoo if necessary.  treat dandruff. 

 Since gun laws vary significantly from state to state, it's important to check the laws of the state in which you live before you buy an antique firearm. If you move to another state, don't assume the laws are the same and you can continue to legally own an antique firearm just because you legally owned it somewhere else.For example, anyone convicted of a felony is prohibited from buying a firearm. However, this prohibition doesn't apply to many antique firearms. The types of guns included, however, depend on state law. Muzzle-loading rifles, shotguns, and pistols that use black powder rather than fixed ammunition generally can be purchased by felons. However, if the weapons are converted so that they can fire fixed ammunition, they may not be allowed. Additionally, many states have additional regulations regarding characteristics such as flintlocks, barrel length, and who may own them.; , Most states exempt antique firearms from the general licensing and ownership requirements to legally own modern firearms. However, each state applies this exception in different ways, and may define "antique firearm" differently.Under federal law, an antique firearm is any firearm produced before 1898. The federal definition also includes replicas, which means the firearm may have been manufactured recently, but if it was manufactured to exactly duplicate a firearm produced before 1898, it is still considered an antique firearm. Most states use the same definition as federal law. However, some states include newer firearms as well. In these states, a firearm is considered an antique if it was manufactured more than 50 years ago and is not still being manufactured. With these relatively newer weapons that are still considered antiques, there may be additional restrictions on their ownership. Typically that depends on the type of ammunition they use.  If you're unsure about how the exception applies, of if you are eligible to purchase or own an antique firearm legally, speaking to someone such as a federal firearms licensee can help you understand the law.The state government agency that regulates firearms typically will be your most reliable source. You can identify this agency by searching on the internet or asking a licensed gun dealer near you. If you don't feel comfortable calling up the state agency, a licensed gun dealer near you usually can give you full information about the laws in your state. You also may be able to find out about your ability to legally own an antique firearm by talking to an attorney, such as a criminal defense attorney. If you've been convicted of a felony, this may be your best resource.  Typically, you don't need a license to buy or own an antique firearm. However, not being licensed limits your ability to use or transport your gun, and you may not be able to sell it to others.A state license generally is a "license to carry," meaning you need the license if, for example, you want to take your antique firearm to a local shooting range and fire it. Some states such as Massachusetts have exempted antique firearms from the license to carry. However, before you rely on this you should check to make sure that your antique firearm falls within the licensing exemption, which may differ from the purchase or possession exemption. When you buy your antique firearm, think about the reason for your purchase and what you anticipate doing with it. If you're a collector who intends to hang it on your wall or display it in a case, and knows you're never going to attempt to fire it, you shouldn't need a license in most states.  If you want to collect antique firearms and plan on buying and selling them on a regular basis, a curios and relics license will allow you to do that more efficiently.A C&R license is a type of federal firearms license (FFL) that allows you to buy and sell antique firearms directly without having to go through a licensed dealer. The license is issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF). You can download a copy of the application from the ATF's website. A C&R license allows you to buy and sell antique firearms, including any firearm that is at least 50 years old or that has historical or collectible significance. Once you get your license, you must keep records of each firearm you buy or sell, including the make, model, serial number, and type of firearm. You also must record the name and address (or FFL number) of the buyer or seller of the weapon.  You can find numerous antique firearms available online, at pawn shops, or in other locations. However, without knowing the dealer's reputation you can't be sure that you're actually getting what you've paid for.If you have a C&R license, you'll have to get details about the person from whom you're buying the firearm for your records. However, apart from that information, you should be able to find out basic information about the reputation of this particular seller before you buy an antique firearm from them. While this isn't necessarily a legal consideration, it can be if someone sells you a firearm claiming that it is an antique, when it really isn't – particularly if you don't have a license to buy or possess modern firearms.  If you're a collector, or if you're concerned about the collectible or historical value of a particular antique firearm, an independent appraisal can let you know what you're getting and how much it's worth.Who you contact for an appraisal depends on the type of firearm you're purchasing. If you're only concerned about the age of the weapon, you want to find an antique firearms expert. Your local gun dealer may be able to point you to someone who specializes in dating antique firearms. If the antique firearm is alleged to have particular historical significance, you will want to have it evaluated by a museum curator or historian who specializes in that particular period of time or type of weaponry.  State and federal laws cover the shipping or transport of firearms from one state to another, and from another country into the United States. Even if your seller is located in the same state as you, your state may have specific legal requirements for transporting the weapon.If you have a C&R license, you don't have to worry about transport restrictions if you're buying and selling within your own state. However, to transport an antique firearm across state lines, you typically must use a federal firearms licensee within the state where the firearm is located. That licensee can then transfer the firearm to you, or to a federal firearms licensee in your state to deliver to you. If you want to import an antique firearm (or ammunition) from another country, this also must be done by a registered firearm dealer. The ATF provides forms which must be completed prior to making an international purchase or sale and transfer. Visit the ATF website to download those documents. If the firearm you wish to transport is more than 100 years old, it is eligible for duty-free transport internationally. However, you must be able to provide proof of age.  When selling one of your antique firearms, you typically must go through a federal firearms licensee to complete the transfer. In some states, you may be allowed to make the sale at a local law enforcement agency.States have different laws regarding private sales between two private individuals. Many states require you to complete the sale using a federal firearms licensee, but some do not. For example, suppose you see an antique firearm on an online auction site that you want to purchase. Your state law controls how the final transfer of the weapon can be made. Generally it can't simply be shipped to you. Instead, you must meet with the seller in person to take possession of the antique firearm. Talk to a gun dealer in your area or contact the state agency that regulates and enforces state gun laws to learn if you must use a federal firearms licensee to complete private transactions.  Each state has specific laws regarding the storage of firearms, whether antique or modern. Some cities have their own gun laws as well, which may further restrict how you can store your antique firearms.In some states, antique firearms are not exempted from state storage laws. However, others carve out an exemption for antiques being displayed for collection purposes, provided they are not loaded. Generally, you should avoid keeping even antique firearms where children can reach them or take them down to play with them. Keep in mind that children are naturally curious, and will want to inspect anything within their reach.  All states have requirements for the safe transportation of a weapon. Even if you move, or are taking your antique firearm out of state yourself, there may be restrictions on how you can transport your weapon across state lines.If you're transporting your antique firearms because you're moving to another state, make sure they're secured properly and safely, and are not loaded while they are being transported. In some instances, particularly if you don't have a license yourself, you may be required to ship your antique firearm to a federal firearms licensee. They will return the weapon to you when you arrive at your destination. When you're traveling between states, more than one state's laws may come into play. If you don't want to go through the hassle of trying to analyze the gun laws of several states, it may be easiest to arrange for your antique firearm to be shipped to a federal firearms licensee so you can pick it up when you arrive at your destination.  If you give or loan your antique firearm to anyone else, you typically must go through a federal firearms licensee – even if it isn't a sell and no money is exchanging hands.This typically will not apply if you have a C&R license – in that case you can complete the transfer yourself. However, if the person to whom you're transferring the firearm is not licensed, you may need to find a federal firearms licensee to receive the firearm for them. For example, suppose you have an antique firearm and you want to give it to your nephew, who has recently started collecting antique firearms. Even though no money is changing hands, you may need to go through a federal firearms licensee if you don't have a license yourself. However, if you do have a license, you should be able to complete the transfer on your own. Contact a gun dealer near you if you are unsure whether you can transfer your antique firearm to someone else. They will let you know what your state law allows.  Many state laws do not allow antique firearms to be stored loaded. Particularly if the gun uses black powder, these weapons are highly volatile and dangerous if they're loaded but not fired.In some states and cities, any ammunition you own must be kept in a separate, locked container from the antique firearm itself. Keep in mind that the idea that collectors typically don't intend to use antique firearms in the same way or for the same purposes people have modern firearms is part of the reason for the exemption from various licensing requirements. States that allow gun owners to keep loaded weapons for self-defense purposes typically do not allow muzzle-loaded weapons that use black powder for ammunition to be kept loaded. You should only "load" a black-powder weapon if you intend to fire it immediately. If your muzzle-loaded weapon has been converted so that it can fire standard bullets, it may not be considered an antique firearm as a result of that modification.  

check your state law.  evaluate the "antique firearms" exception.  contact an expert.  apply for a state license.  consider getting a curios and relics (c&r) license.  buy only from reputable dealers.  get an independent appraisal.  review transport laws.  work with a federal firearms licensee.  store your firearms appropriately.  check legal requirements if you need to move your weapon.  use federal firearms licensees for transfers.  keep your antique firearms unloaded.

 It is imperative that your measurements be as close to accurate as possible. Macarons are a very fiddly dessert that require a lot of precision. You may find it easier to measure your ingredients by weight (digitally if possible), instead of with cups (as is standard in North America). For this recipe, you will need a measuring tool that can calculate grams.  Macarons utilize egg whites, which can be one of the most difficult ingredients to master and use both safely and effectively. Separating egg whites is quite difficult. It is very important that none of the egg yolk is mixed in with the whites; otherwise, the meringue will not whip and the cookie shell will not properly form. Specific tools made to separate egg yolks and whites are often readily available. If it is not possible for you to obtain a specific separating utensil, then read How to separate an egg for instructions on how to properly procure the egg whites from your eggs.; , Line a large baking sheet or tray with greaseproof paper or parchment (baking) paper. If the baking sheets are small, you may need to line two., Pulse until you have created a very fine dust. Sieve through the mixture to remove any large chunks, discarding any remains that haven't passed through the sieve, before returning the mixture back into the food processor., Pour into the food processor, along with the mixture. Blend the mixture and the measured egg whites to create a paste., Heat the mixture until the sugar has dissolved and it forms a syrupy consistency., Whisk until they appear light and fluffy and form soft peaks. Then, whisk in the red food colouring with the mixer, and gradually mix in the syrup in small increments. Continue whisking until the mixture has stiffened and appears shiny. Then transfer it to a clean mixing bowl., It is essential that you fold and not stir it!, Pipe circles around 4cm in diameter onto the baking trays (previously lined with baking paper). Then, lift the baking tray off the surface and knock the bottom against the counter or surface, controlling your motions carefully to prevent it from spilling. (This flattens the macaroons and removes air bubbles from the meringue)., Bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the shells are firm. Leave the oven door slightly ajar. After removing the baked macarons from the oven, allow them to cool on wire baking racks. Once cooled, they can be filled with the strawberry buttercream (see next)., These are outlined above., Use the back of the spoon to push the strawberry pieces through into a mixing bowl., Using a whisk attachment, whisk in the icing sugar and strawberry purée until fully blended., To make each macaron, pipe the buttercream onto the flat surface of a macaron half and sandwich it shut with the flat surface of another macaron half. Continue until all are made., The macarons can be served after making or stored chilled in an airtight container for two to three days. They are best consumed within 12 to 24 hours. 

understand your ingredients.  preheat the oven to 325ºf /170ºc.  place the icing (powdered) sugar and almond meal in a food processor.  measure out 85 grams of the egg whites.  place the sugar and water in a heavy-based saucepan (a saucepan with a thicker base designed to evenly distribute heat).  mix the remaining 90g of egg whites in a mixer with a whisk attachment.  fold the almond mixture into the meringue with a large metal spoon.  spoon the mixture into a piping bag with a 1cm nozzle.  place the macaroons in the preheated oven.  prepare the ingredients.  begin by finely chopping the large strawberries before pressing them through a fine sieve to make a puree.  beat the butter in a mixing bowl with a paddle attachment until it is light and fluffy.  spoon the mixture into a piping bag.  serve. 

 A dry mouth can lead to bad breath and sticky lips. Make sure to drink enough fluids daily to ensure that your lips are smooth and your breath is kissable., More importantly, don't take your partner on a date to a restaurant that serves bad breath-inducing foods. Some common trigger foods are:   Garlic. Onions. Tuna or sardines. Spicy foods. Coffee. Alcohol., While this tip may be a given for most, there are some people who neglect to accept the basic premises of good hygiene. Make sure to brush and floss twice daily to remove any bacteria build up in your mouth. Bacteria causes bad breath. Rinse with mouthwash for an added boost of freshness.  Especially after consuming any food, make sure to pop a mint or chew some gum before kissing someone. If you choose to chew gum, make sure to spit it out before you start kissing. Your partner doesn't want to eat your leftover gum, and gum can also cause you to choke while kissing.  

stay hydrated.  avoid trigger foods and drinks that cause especially bad breath.  brush and floss your teeth twice daily.  have a mint or chew some gum. 

 Simmer the necessary amount of water in a saucepan and transfer the hot water into a large bucket. Add powder or liquid dye and stir until evenly dispersed.   The amount of dye you need will depend on how much lace you want to dye. If you have 1 lb (450 g) of lace, you will one package of powder dye or 1/2 bottle of liquid dye, as well as 3 gallons (12 L) of hot water.If working with powdered dye, dissolve it in 2 cups (500 ml) hot water first before adding it to the large bucket of water. The ideal water temperature for your dye bath is 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius). Make sure that you add the dye to the water before adding the lace. If you add the lace first, you may cause spotting to occur.; , Place your lace into the bucket of diluted dye. Make sure that it is completely submerged.   You might want to use a wooden or plastic mixing spoon to help keep the lace submerged. You could also use your hands as long as you have thick rubber gloves on. It is highly recommended that you wear rubber gloves, a smock or apron, and clothes that you do not mind dirtying while working with dye.  After the first 5 minutes, 1 cup (250 ml) salt to the dye bath or 1 cup (250 ml) white vinegar. Doing so will help intensify and set the color.   Use salt if your lace contains cotton, rayon, ramie, or linen. Use vinegar if your lace contains nylon, silk, or wool.  For the strongest, richest hue, dye the lace for 30 minutes, stirring slowly and gently throughout the process.If you want a more subtle effect, only keep the lace in for 8 to 10 minutes. Lace absorbs dye quickly and does not need to sit in a dye bath for very long. Stirring the lace is highly recommended since doing so helps the fabric dye evenly.  Remove the dyed lace from the dye bath and rinse it under warm water for a couple of minutes. Afterward, rinse it under cool running water until the water runs clear.   Warm water rinses off the surface dye better, but cool water is recommended after you get this surface dye off since it discourages the color from bleeding out.  Hand or machine wash the lace under a gentle cycle. Use mild detergent and warm water for the cleaning part of the cycle, but use cool water for the rinse cycle. Hang dry.   Note that the lace will be a slightly lighter shade when it dries.  

prepare the dye.  dunk the lace in the dye.  add salt or vinegar.  let it sit for up to 30 minutes.  rinse.  wash and dry the lace. 

 Something that's rather shiny and reflective. Cut it to the size you need. Aluminum foil works well for a prop-like mirror.; , Whatever type of glue you use, make sure you can spread it on evenly. Be careful if you're using a hot glue gun -- burning yourself with glue isn't a fun part of a DIY project.  This top layer makes it look a lot more professional and keeps the mirror from getting damaged or torn. The glass on a cheap frame is ideal for this step.  This could be cardstock, cardboard, fabric, or any material that can form a border. Add glitter, ribbons, beads, or any embellishment you have available.   The easiest way is to use a real frame and spruce it up how you like. Find a cheap one and spray paint it, paper mache, or otherwise make it your own.  

get a piece of silver paper, cloth, etc.  glue it to a piece of wood or stiff paper.  get a sheet of glass and put over the paper/cloth.  design an appealing frame. 

 This may or may not be the same as the asking price for the asset. Before making a commitment, you want to know how much you could sell the asset for in today's less than desirable economy and compare that amount to the seller's price. If the 2 figures are somewhat close, further consideration of the acquisition may be worthwhile.; , Depending on the nature of the asset and how the economy is affecting the value of that asset, there is a chance that the market value will either increase or decrease over the next year or so. Look beyond this short-term shift in value, and attempt to determine what the asset will be worth several years from now, taking into consideration all known economic factors. This will give you some idea if the acquisition will ultimately generate profits or will end up posting a loss that could undermine the ability to hang on to your other assets.  If the purchase involves buying a company, determine if some of the holdings of the business could be immediately sold after the acquisition to offset the cost of purchase without harming the core operation and its ability to generate revenue.  Should that company currently owe debts that would be transferred to you in the event that the acquisition take place, make sure that debt would not be enough to cripple your current financial status.  Even if the projected risk is somewhat low, you still want to acquire the asset for the best possible price. Make a counter offer that is slightly below current market value and continue to incrementally raise that amount until a price is reached that both the buyer and seller can agree upon.  

investigate the current market value of the asset under consideration.  project the future movement of that market value.  consider any assets that may be included in the acquisition.  identify any liabilities that may be connected with the acquisition.  negotiate the asking price based on the information you've collected. 

 This helps trigger your memory.  This helps you to begin thinking about it in your own terms and helps you to better conceptualize it., This can hone your technique for writing down only what matters, in terms that make sense to you., These are red flags for later deeper research., This means listening with care and noticing when your mind is wandering or you feel distracted and forcing yourself to return to paying attention., Listen with clarity. Also, do not write at the moment of needing to listen, even writing is distracting when the message needs to go in.  One exception is to teach yourself to continue listening as you write. This is an invaluable skill and also trains your memory and your ability to juggle or multi-task two distinct items at once. , This means everything.  Don't think too hard, just list everything what you have learn in any order or randomly, so you are able to recall with ease all that you have heard. The more that you do this, the better it becomes.  

write down all the keywords that apply to the topic.  write down explanations that are new to you.  expect to be quizzed after the lecture.  add notes that the teacher or lecturer seems to find most important, persuasive or useful.  listen attentively.  do not talk or pass notes.when listening, seek to understand what is being said.  after the discussion or the class, go to the library and list all what you have remembered and learn from the class. 

 How you access the batteries will depend on the device they are powering. In general you will need to open or remove the device's cover to access the battery cradle. Remove any old batteries. Assess these old batteries for cracks and leakage. Any leakage is likely potassium hydroxide, a strong base. If leakage is found proceed with caution and be sure to wear skin and eye protection, as potassium hydroxide is caustic.   You should never try to clean up any battery leakage with the following methods. The following baking soda cleaning method is just for any corrosion around the terminals, not for a leaking battery.  Examine the now empty battery cradle's terminals and the battery for corrosion. Mild corrosion will appear as black spots, more severe corrosion appears as a white, ashy deposit around one or both battery posts or terminals. If you see corrosion follow the steps below to clean.  Use a damp soft cloth or cotton swab to remove any major corrosion deposits. Wear vinyl (dishwashing) gloves while cleaning any battery corrosion.   In some lucky cases the entire battery cradle may be removable from the electronic device. If this is the case you may soak the entire case in water or a diluted baking soda solution. However, in most cases you will have to patiently rub off the corrosion with a cotton swab, while the battery cradle remains in the device. Take care not to touch with bare skin the white crusty buildup, as it is caustic. Be careful not to get any water on your electronics when cleaning.  Make your cleaning agent by combine 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of baking soda with a teaspoon or so of water. Stir to make a paste. Apply the baking soda paste to the battery connections using a cotton swab or small piece of cloth. Once the baking soda is applied, you may see it bubble and foam, as it reacts with the corrosion.   Be careful, although baking soda is generally safe, you should take care not to get it on other electronic components or your self.  When the foaming stops and there are no major deposits left to be scraped out. You need to rinse your connections. To do this, use just a little water applied with a cotton swab. Be very careful not to get any water any electrical components.  Wipe the terminals clean with a dry clean rag.  Add something hydrophobic, such as petroleum jelly or grease to the now cleaned terminals. This will help slow future corrosion.  Put new batteries into the now clean battery cradle, and close up the case or put back on the cover. 

access and assess your batteries.  assess the corrosion.  clean with water.  clean with baking soda.  rinse.  dry.  prevent future corrosion.  put everything back.  done.  

 Frustration and overstimulation can lead to self-injurious behavior (SIB). This behavior can be very scary for parents, but you should know that it is common and preventable.   Researchers also believe that biochemicals play a role. During self-injury, endorphins are released, which inhibit the individual from feeling much pain while making him/her feel happier.  Some parents have noticed that switching to a gluten-free diet helps, as does increasing the intake of vitamin B6 and calcium.   Some of the best sources of vitamin B6 include sunflower seeds, pistachio nuts, fish, poultry, pork, beef, prunes, raisins, bananas, avocados, and spinach. Some of the best sources of calcium include milk, cheese, yogurt, spinach, kale, okra, collards, soybeans, white beans, and calcium-fortified juices and cereals. Always consult a doctor before altering a child's diet.  Some autistic individuals rub their skin excessively to receive stimulation or do some other potentially injurious behavior and wind up hurting themselves. Intervene by encouraging safer forms of stimulation. Massage can work, as can rubbing the skin lightly with a brush, or wearing a thin layer of clothing over the skin (e.g. sweatpants) to prevent damage while scratching.   Remember that many autistic people don't like the idea of hurting themselves. Work with your child to find alternative ways to stim. For example, hitting one's head could be replaced by rapidly shaking the head. Search the internet to see what substitutes autistic adults have found for their SIB. Be consistent. Autistic children need to know that self harm is not appropriate or allowed, that you will always be there to help them handle it. Work with other caregivers and teachers so that everyone uses the same approach.  If your child’s self-injurious behavior seems to result from frustration, do what you can to deal with that. This may mean developing new communication methods, backing off on certain activities, or taking care not to put your child in a situation likely to cause sensory overload.  

know that self-injury is very common among autistic people.  experiment with nutritional intervention.  encourage safe forms of stimulation.  deal with sources of frustration. 

 You can part it down the center of off to the side. This style works best with shoulder to collarbone-length hair.  Separate two thin sections of hair from your temples. Pull the rest of your hair back, then tie or clip it out of the way.  Braid the first section, then tie it off with a clear elastic. Braid the other section, and tie it off as well.When you are done, they will be sort of dangling by your face. If you'd like to, you can temporarily clip them out of the way.  Untie or unclip your hair. Split it down the center into two equal-sized sections, just like making two braids or pigtails.  Do not include the mini braids from the top of your head. Tie each back braid off with a clear elastic.If your hair is very thick, you may need to use a mini hair tie or regular hair tie instead. Be sure to use one that matches your hair color, however.  Take the left back braid. Pull it across the back of your head, towards your right ear. Secure it with bobby pins.         If your hair is very long, you may have to bring the braid back over to the left side of your hair, and secure it with more bobby pins.  Take the right back braid, and pull it across the back of your head, right above the first braid. Secure it with bobby pins. Tuck the end under itself, and secure it with some more bobby pins.         The right braid should hide the end of the left braid. If it doesn't, then tuck and pin the end of the left braid out of sight. Again, if your hair is long, you will need to wrap the right braid back towards the right side of your head.  Unclip the mini braids. Wrap them across the back of your head, right above the back braids. Tuck the ends under themselves, then secure the mini braids with bobby pins.        

part your hair.  section off your hair.  braid the two sections.  split the rest of your hair into two sections.  braid both sections of hair.  pin the left back braid across the back of your head.  repeat for the right back braid.  pin the mini braids above the back braids.

 If you intend to use a paddle holster for a concealed carry weapon, consider choosing a firearm with a short barrel.Most paddle holsters will hold the pistol low and angle it away from your body. As a result, the bottom of the holster and/or firearm has a tendency to peek out from beneath the average shirt or jacket when the holster is used for a long-barreled pistol. If you do not want to use a short-barreled pistol, you might be able to avoid this problem by wearing the holster higher on the waist. Note that you will need to wear the waistband of your pants higher on your waist, as well, for this option to work.; , Before going any further, make sure that the pistol is safe by verifying that the safety is on.   If you intend to carry a loaded pistol, the pistol should be loaded before you insert it into the holster. If you do not wish to carry a loaded pistol, make sure that it is not loaded before you proceed.  Grab the handle of the pistol, then slide the barrel of the pistol into the holster. Continue until the entire gun is securely seated in the body of the holster.   Keep your finger off the trigger and along the side of the gun as you handle it. If your holster has a button latch, fold the latch down and snap it in place to further secure the weapon.  While not always necessary, wearing a belt can help keep the paddle holster more secure.   Wear a belt if your pants feel loose or saggy. Keeping your pants secure around your waist will make the holster more comfortable and safer to use. Even if your pants fit well without a belt, the use of a belt is still recommended. Paddle holsters are held in place with tension. By putting another layer (the belt) in between the side of the holster and the holster clip, you create more tension and keep the holster more secure. Note that most paddle holsters work best with belts that are 2 inches (5 cm) wide or smaller.  Grab the holster by gripping the handle of the gun. Make sure that the firearm is securely seated in the holster before continuing.   As before, you should keep your fingers off the trigger and outside of the trigger guard. The pistol and holster should move as one. If they don't, the firearm may not be seated in the holster securely enough, and this could pose a safety threat if not corrected. When you grab the pistol and holster, make sure that the rigid paddle portion of the holster faces the dominant side of your body. The firearm should face away from your dominant side.  Position the holster at the 3-o'clock position and guide the rigid paddle portion of the holster so that it clips in between your pants and underwear.The paddle must be in between your pants and underwear. It should not be hooked loosely around the belt. Use the 3-o'clock position if you are right-handed or the 9-o'clock position if you are left-handed. If this position feels uncomfortable or unnatural to you, you can easily adjust it later. Many paddle holsters are designed to work with the angle of your body based on this position, however, making it the best one to start with.  Push the positioned paddle completely beneath the waistband of your pant.Continue pushing the paddle downward as far as it will go. If your paddle holster has a security clip or hook along the underside of the paddle, it may hear or feel it click into place once the paddle slides past the seam of your waistband. This security clip will help prevent the holster from sliding out when you go to retrieve your gun., Since the paddle is not locked into any specific position, you can slide the holster around your waist until it settles into a comfortable, natural point along the curve of your body.Generally, you will need to position the holster somewhere between your side and mid-back. Regardless of where you keep the holster, keep in mind that you must be able to grab the gun and remove it from the holster in a single, fluid motion. Otherwise, the holster is not serving its designated purpose.  When you need to draw your pistol, grab the handle of the gun with your dominant hand and lift it straight up. Once the barrel has cleared the holster, grip the firearm with both hands and aim as needed.   If the holster has a button latch, you will need to unsnap the latch before removing the gun. The tension and lip on the clip of the paddle should hold the holster in place as you remove the gun, especially if you lift the gun straight up. Keep your fingers away from the trigger until you are ready to shoot. Make sure that the gun is properly and safely aimed before placing your finger on the trigger and firing the gun.  As an out-of-the-waistband holster, you will need to wear a long, loose top capable of covering the pistol and holster to conceal it. The top can be a shirt or jacket, but either way, it must be long enough to hide the entire holster from sight.Paddle holsters are notoriously bulky due to the way they angle out from the body, so you will probably notice a bulge if your top is too tight. For that reason, it is strongly recommended that you wear loose clothes over the paddle holster, instead.  To remove the holster, grab the handle of the gun and use it to tilt the paddle toward your body and away from the side of your pants. With the paddle tilted, lift the weapon up and out.   If you do not tilt the paddle in this manner, it might get stuck on the waistband of your belt when you try to remove it. The pistol could accidentally come out if you carelessly allow the holster to get stuck.  

consider using a small pistol.  check the pistol.  slide the pistol into the holster.  consider wearing a belt.  grip the handle of the gun.  position the holster.  push the paddle underneath the waistband.  adjust the position as necessary.  draw the pistol as needed.  wear loose clothes to conceal the pistol.  know how to remove the holster. 

 You will want to purchase large zucchini, so that your rounds are large enough to hold toppings. Chop each slice about 1/4 inch thick, and lay out on a pan., Lift each round and lightly spray both the front and back. This is important so that it doesn’t stick to your pan. Then, sprinkle all of them with salt and pepper., Both methods work, so just use whichever one is easiest for you. They should be prepared at a medium-high heat. Set your timer to two minutes, and then flip all of your rounds. Broil or grill them for another two minutes on the other side., Once they’ve been broiled or grilled, place them all on a large, lined baking sheet. Now, it’s time to top your pizza bites. Because they’re so little, it’s easiest to stick with the traditional pizza toppings to achieve the “pizza bite” taste. Add a bit of tomato sauce, cheese, and even tiny pieces of pepperoni, if you like., Once you’ve carefully topped all of your slices, it’s time to pop them in the oven for just a couple more minutes. Keep an eye on it the whole time, because you can ruin your beautiful pizza bites easily at this step. Remove your pan once the cheese has melted, and sprinkle a little bit of Italian seasoning on each bite. Serve these low carb pizza bites as an appetizer or a party treat, and you’re sure to get compliments!  

chop your zucchini into rounds.  spray zucchini rounds with nonstick cooking spray.  broil or grill the zucchini rounds.  top your zucchini slices.  broil your topped zucchini bites for one to three more minutes.

   Raise means "lift" and is a transitive verb, meaning it needs a subject and an object (i.e. subject + “raise” + object). Ex. “They voted to raise taxes.” Ex. “Raise the roof!”  ,   Rise means "move upward." It is an intransitive verb and only needs a subject. Ex. “His blood pressure rose.” Ex. “Taxes rose 2% last year.” (Of course, they were raised by someone, but since that isn’t mentioned in this sentence, “rise” is the correct verb to use.)  

use “raise” as instructed.  use "rise” as instructed. 

 It is fairly normal for your ears to itch. The hundreds of little hairs on and in your ear can be tickled easily. If your ear itches constantly and scratching/rubbing doesn’t satiate your problem, you might have a fungal infection. This is the primary way that fungal ear infections present themselves., You’ll almost always experience ear pain in one ear — not both, because the fungal infection is local. Sometimes, sufferers describe this as “pressure” or “fullness.” The pain can be mild or severe. Pain usually intensifies the more you touch your ear., Fungal ear discharge is usually thick and can be clear, white, yellow, and sometimes bloody/foul-smelling. Do not confuse this with normal waxy build up. Take a Q-Tip and swab your ear (being careful not to insert the tip into your ear canal). There will be a normal level of waxy buildup, but if either the amount or color seems off, you may have a fungal infection in your ear., A fungal ear infection may present itself in the form of muffled speech/sounds, difficulty understanding words, and trouble hearing consonants. Sometimes, people recognize their hearing loss more by a change in behavior. Frustration brews as a result of one’s inability to hear, so said person withdraws from conversations and social settings. 

recognize abnormal ear itching (pruritis).  recognize ear pain (otalgia).  check for ear discharge (otorrhea).  check for hearing loss. 

 Anything hanging on the walls should be the first to go, but everything that can be removed should be, including other decorations, furniture, electrical switch plates, and phone jack covers. Even though you may not bump into these items as you paint the upper wall along the ceiling, you will need to remove them later in order to paint the rest of the wall. Moreover, paint could drip onto these objects as you paint the upper wall. For these reasons, you must remove them first before applying any paint.; , You will not be working with a lot of paint all at once as you work on the area of the wall near the ceiling, so your odds of dripping paint onto the floor are not as high as they will be when you paint the rest of the wall. Even so, some risk still remains. Play it safe by protecting your floor before you break any paint out.  If you are painting your ceiling as well as your walls, you should paint the ceiling first. Painting the ceiling is more difficult, and you are more likely to make errors than you are while painting the walls. Additionally, paint from the ceiling may drip down onto the walls. If you painted the walls first, the area nearest the ceiling would likely need to be redone after you applied ceiling paint.  You will need to apply tape to the ceiling, and partially damp paint is more likely to come up than dry paint. Depending on the brand and type of paint you use, you may need to wait anywhere from a few hours to overnight before you can start work on your walls.  Apply the tape in 2- to 3-foot (2/3- to 1-meter) strips. Strips longer than this may be difficult to work with.  Press down on it firmly until it lies flat against the ceiling.  There should be no pockets of air. Otherwise, you run the risk of paint seeping beneath the tape and onto the ceiling.  By the end, your entire ceiling should have a ring of tape around it, directly where the ceiling and wall meet.  Using a standard painter's tray will only make the task more difficult, since these trays tend to be bulky and may be difficult to maneuver while standing on a ladder. A small bowl, in contrast, can easily be held in one hand, and a few cups of paint are all you will need to start with.   If you do need more paint to finish the space around your ceiling, you can refill your bowl when you step down to move your ladder.  Most of the paint should be on the bottom 1/2 inch to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) of the brush. With a bulkier brush, excess paint from the top edge of the brush could rub against the ceiling as you move along the wall. A flat painter's brush that angles in will allow you to apply paint to the surface of the wall without accidentally applying paint to the surface above your brush.  The bottom edge of the brush should just barely touch the painter's tape to ensure that the paint extends up to the highest point of the wall.  Applying paint with a paintbrush is more time consuming, but also more accurate. Painting 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) down gives you a little breathing space later on, making it easier to paint the rest of the wall using a roller without needing to get too close to the ceiling.  This process is often called "cutting in," and even professionals use it to safely apply paint to the tight area of your wall where it meets the ceiling. When you finish, you should have a solid 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) line of paint along the top of each wall.    As you paint the rest of the room, only allow the roller to reach as high as your initial 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) strip of wall paint. Do not push or drag the roller all the way up to the ceiling. After your entire wall dries, you can remove the painter's tape. Removing it beforehand could smear the paint on your wall, ruining your efforts at keeping paint off the ceiling.  

remove everything from the room.  cover the floor with plastic sheets.  paint the ceiling first.  wait until the ceiling paint has finished drying.  cover the ceiling near the wall with painter's tape.  place one end of the first strip in the corner of the ceiling, right where the ceiling meets the wall.  slowly drag the tape along the length of the ceiling in a straight line, pressing it down firmly until it lies flat against the ceiling.  repeat the taping process with as many strips of tape you need.  pour 1 or 2 cups (250 to 500 milliliters) of wall paint into a small bowl.  dip a small angled brush into the paint.  lay your paintbrush flat against the wall, starting at a corner of the room.  drag the brush down 2 inches (5 centimeters) from the top of the wall.  use the brush to paint along the entire perimeter of the room.  proceed with painting the wall as usual, but allow the paint to dry before removing the tape.

 In addition to facial expression and tone of voice, humans express emotion in other ways.While nonverbal cues can be misleading, learning to pick up on them can help you read emotion. Important nonverbal cues that convey emotion are body movements, posture, and eye contact. Make an effort to notice whether she appears animated and moving around or is stiff and tense. Also, does she stand up straight and make eye contact, or hunch her shoulders, fidget with her hands or, cross her arms.   Moving around and standing up straight shows she feels open and comfortable. However, too much movement (e.g. energetic arm waving) combined with a loud voice could mean she is excited or angry. Hunched shoulders, a quiet voice, and crossed arms are signs she feels uncomfortable or nervous. If she refuses to make eye contact with you, it could mean she is upset or feels guilty.Keep in mind that culture, social situations, and individual personalities influence how we express emotion through body language.In this sense, facial expressions are considered more universal and reliable. For example, Italians tend to move their arms when they speak, but this could be considered impolite in Japan. Or, making eye contact is a sign of respect in the United States and Europe, but is considered rude or aggressive in some Asian and African cultures.  Focusing on the entire body in addition to the face is the best way to read and interpret emotions.Posture and body movements not only reflects emotion, but also the intensity of an emotion. There are degrees of positive and negative emotion. For example, positive emotions range from interested (low) to elated (high), and negative from sadness (low) to violent anger (high).   Shoulders and torso: hunching the shoulders and leaning forward is associated with intense anger. In contrast, leaning backwards can be a sign of panic or fear. If she stands up straight with her shoulders back and head held high, this is a sign she feel confident. However, if she hunches their shoulders or slumps forward, then she is looking for sympathy, is bored, or feels nervous.Arms and hands: If she is sad, she will likely place her arms next to her side and put her hands in her pocket. If she is annoyed or irritated, she might place one arm on her side or hips, and gesture with her opposite hand (pointing or flat palm). If she feels indifferent or doesn't care, then she will place her hands behind her back.       Legs and feet: If she shakes her legs or taps her toes, then she might be anxious, annoyed, or in a hurry.However, some people naturally shake their legs while sitting without it meaning anything.  When something unexpected happens, whether it is good or bad, it stimulates a part of the brain that is outside of our direct control. This results in physical responses such as dilated pupils, rapid breathing, increased sweating, and increase heart rate.You can tell if she is nervous, stressed, or anxious by looking for signs such as a sweaty palms or armpits, red or flushed faced, or shaking hands.   When men are upset or stressed, they tend to show signs of aggression, frustration, and anger. In contrast, women might become more talkative or seek social support. Depending on their personality, some men and women become more withdrawn and quiet when experiencing negative emotions. , Sometimes the best way to read emotion is to be direct. While the other person might lie and say she is fine when she isn't, it never hurts to ask. You can also use her response to read between the lines by noting tone of voice combined with facial expression and body language. You can also look for specific verbal cues that suggest how she feels inside.For example, if she is bored or sad, she will speaker slower and at a lower frequency.If she is excited or upset, the speed and frequency of her voice will increase.   Try speaking to her alone rather than in a group. She may be more open and truthful about her emotions if she is with a trusted friend or family member. 

look for nonverbal cues.  notice her body movement and posture.  look for signs of “fight or flight”.  ask how she is feeling.

 Turn the oven on to 250 degrees F (120 C). Tear off parchment paper and line two baking sheets with the paper. Set them aside while you make the butternut squash chips.Ensure that one of your oven racks is in the middle of the oven. This will help the chips cook evenly.  Wash and peel one small butternut squash that's about one pound (455 g) in size. Use a large knife to carefully cut the squash in half so you end up with a thin end and a round end. Scoop the seeds out of the round end and throw them away. Use a mandoline to slice the squash into 1/8-inch thick (3 mm) slices.The slices from the thin end of the squash will be circular slices and the slices from the round end will actually be rings that you can fry.  Place the slices and rings of butternut squash into a large mixing bowl and drizzle them with 4 teaspoons of olive oil. Sprinkle the squash with 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt and 2 teaspoons of chopped fresh herbs. Consider using:Sage Thyme Oregano Rosemary Parsley  , Lay the seasoned butternut squash on the parchment-lined baking sheets. The chips should be in a single layer so they can crisp up as they bake. Bake the chips for one hour in the preheated oven and then turn them over. Bake them for another hour and turn them again. Bake them for one more hour and then turn off the oven. Leave the chips to crisp up in the oven overnight or for several hours before you serve them.The chips will bake for a total of three hours. You'll just need to turn them once every hour so they crisp up evenly. You can store the butternut squash chips in an airtight container for up to one week.  

preheat the oven and prepare the baking sheets.  peel and slice the butternut squash.  season the butternut squash.  arrange and bake the butternut squash chips. 

 If you have a large group, or a lot of time to play, organize a tournament. Draw straws to see who will play who, or let the group decide. Agree on rules before the tournament begins (e.g., decide if you will set a time limit and the person with the most points/assets at the end will win, or if you will play each game to completion before moving on).  It’s easy to get competitive, but the goal is to enjoy yourselves. Remember to make fun the main factor, and don’t worry too much about winning or losing. Congratulate the winners of the game, and always accept congratulations graciously if you are the one to win.  Pick up a few fun prizes, such as candy bars, bubbles, or Play-Doh for children. You could even get cheap scratch tickets or mini bottles of booze for an adult game night.   To stick with the theme, hand out dice, cards, or even a board game to the winners.  

create a tournament.  be a good sport.  offer prizes for the winners. 

 In strict, traditional terms, a semi-formal dress code requires men to wear black tie (that is, a tuxedo, or dinner jacket, as it is called in the United Kingdom). The term "semi-formal" arose to distinguish black tie from white tie, which is worn only to the most formal of events. However, it is worth bearing in mind that many people are unaware of the distinctions between "formal", "semi-formal" or "casual" dress codes, and interpret them in various ways. Therefore, it is crucial to find out what is meant by a particular dress code before choosing what to wear.  Traditional semi-formal attire consists of a dress shirt, tuxedo (or dinner jacket, as it is called in the United Kingdom), a black tie or bowtie, and black shoes. The dress shirt will typically have a winged, detachable collar (though standard collars are becoming more prevalent), and studs will be used instead of buttons. The black shoes can be plain oxfords or, more traditionally, opera pumps.  Ensure that the cloth of your bowtie, cummerbund and jacket collar match. Wear a well-pressed shirt, wear black socks and never wear black tie during the day.  

double check whether the host is using a very strict interpretation of "semi-formal.",  know what to wear for a strict interpretation.  pay attention to your details for a strict semi-formal look. 

 Clearly, it's easier to ask for local help if you're only gone for the weekend but relying on the good nature of other people for longer periods can result in worry and problems. Each of the following steps will depend on the length of time you're spending away from home.; , The first port of call is cat-loving neighbors if you're only spending a short time from a night up to a week away. It's important to read the signs of willingness though – they must love felines, be around, not be snowed under by their own work and life challenges, and they must be asked well in advance unless it's an emergency. Listen carefully to how they respond to your request for help too – if they seem reluctant, don't hesitate to let them off the hook quickly and look for alternatives.  If you have family members who live nearby, see if they're able to swing by regularly to help feed and tend to your cats. Again, this shouldn't be for too long but family ties might help you extend the request! Ditto friends.  There are many pet-sitting services available now that will provide feeding, grooming, caring, etc. services in your own home for a daily fee. Always try to meet with the person beforehand to explain everything about the cat's needs. Many pet-sitters will also collect mail, water plants, etc. This service can work well for up to a month, as you're paying so you don't have to feel guilty but there will be a limit to how long your cat can stand to be alone.  If you plan on being away for a long vacation or stay somewhere else, boarding your cat in a cattery or a vet's boarding service might be the solution. In this case, your cat will usually need to have proof of up-to-date vaccinations and please – no fleas. Some places might also have policies about neutering. This will be the most pricey option but it will give you peace of mind that your pet is being well looked after and attended to regularly. Just be sure to check out the place first and check its reputation, to satisfy yourself.  If your budget is tight, you might try combining some pet-sitting with some neighborly help; plan out crossover dates so that everyone is clear on when they're expected to help out.  In the case where you are going overseas for a long time, boarding your cat may prove too expensive, inconvenient or unavailable. In this case, you will need to consider either rehousing your cat permanently with a new family, or finding a foster family to care for her until you get back. Family can be helpful but don't assume they will do this for you. Call your local cats protection society or your vet for details of possible cat-lovers who have offered to help out in this situation. If you need to send your cat interstate by plane, make all necessary plans well in advance, including packing her favorite toys, blankets, etc., and getting an airworthy carrying case to travel in (check with the airline for an appropriate size/weight etc.).  Although it can be easier to hope things will turn out all right in the rush of getting ready to go away, leaving plans for your pets to the last minute is never a good idea. Thorough planning beforehand will ease your anxieties about your pet's well being and having arrangements in place well before you go away solves last minute crises. If your cat is remaining at home, be sure to have adequate food supplies (always more than enough) and remember to leave the key with whoever is taking care of your cat. Always leave your contact details with the carer; there might be a call about health issues, emergencies etc., and you will need to be reached to make decisions.  Even if you're not going away, owning a pet carries the responsibility of being prepared for any possibility and an emergency is one such possibility. If you are called away because of an emergency, it is a good idea to have in place already a phone tree of people who can jump in and look after your cat while you're gone (this is also wise if you have kids!). That way, instead of panicking about everything, you can calmly call about the cat needing care while you rush away on the emergency. Cats left alone can die of starvation, turn wild, or wander – they don't understand emergencies.  

develop your plan according to the length of time you will be away.  ask the neighbors.  ask your family.  look for a pet-sitting service.  consider boarding your cat.  try a combination of some of the above suggestions.  find a new owner or a foster owner.  be realistic and plan well in advance where possible.  make a plan for the unknown. 

 Use the gentlest, cleanest, and most natural moisturizer you can get your hands on. Things like Benzoyl Peroxide will dry out your skin, leading to cracks and damage. A simple moisturizing cleanser is perfect.          Avoid fragrances or added chemicals -- you just want to clean off. Use lukewarm or cool water when washing and a soft, gentle washcloth to exfoliate away skin cells.; , Do not rub or scrub when drying off -- it just causes skin damage. Instead, focus on lightly patting yourself dry, keeping your skin healthy and happy.  These products, sold in beauty stores across the country, have vitamins, lipids, and enzymes needed to keep skin elastic, hydrated, and grease-free. While you may need to try 2-3 to find one that works for you, these are the secret weapon against dry skin.  Add a light moisturizer to ensure that your skin is well hydrated throughout.  You'll need some time for everything to absorb, so don't apply these right before adding makeup. Right before bed is perfect, as it helps heal your skin without being disrupted while you're asleep.  

use a moisturizing cleanser to wash your face.  pat your face dry when done.  lightly apply a hydrating facial serum to your skin.  apply a light-weight skin moisturizer to finish up.  repeat this routine daily bed or right when you get up. 

 If you want to record your gameplay on PC, you'll need to use a screen capture program. One of the most popular free options is Open Broadcast Software (OBS). This program is completely free and open source, and can record as well as most commercial programs. You can download OBS Multiplatform for Windows, Mac, and Linux at obsproject.com., The installer is very basic, and you can leave all of the settings at their defaults. As long as you downloaded the program from obsproject.com, you shouldn't have to worry about adware., You can find this by clicking the "File" menu and selecting "Settings," or by clicking the "Settings" button in the main window., This will allow you to adjust your basic video settings for your recordings. There are a few options that you'll want to take a look at:  Video Bitrate - This is the quality of the video. A higher bitrate will lead to a higher-quality image but lead to a larger file. Recording Path - This is the location that recorded videos will be saved on your computer. Recording Format - By default, this will be set to "flv." You may want to select "mp4" for maximum compatibility.  This will allow you to assign specific keys to starting and stopping your recording. This will allow you to start recording while in the middle of a game., You can use single keys or combinations. Try to use a key that you won't be using in the game, such as one of the Function keys or a combination of Ctrl and another key., There are several things you might want to change before starting to record:Output (Scaled) Resolution - This is the resolution that your recorded video will be displayed in. A lower resolution will lead to a smaller file, but the quality will suffer. If you want the output to be the same as you see, set it to the same value as the Base (Canvas) Resolution. Common FPS Values - This will lock the framerate of the video to the number you set (as long as your game can perform at that framerate). YouTube now supports 60 FPS video, so you may want to change this setting.  If you want to record your voice along with the gameplay, you can check and enable your microphone on this tab. You can also enable push-to-talk for your microphone so that you can record your voice when the key is held.  Close the Settings menu after checking your audio settings.  This will create a new Game Capture entry in the Sources list., Once you've got OBS configured, you can start playing your game. You can play any game on your computer from any source, including Steam, Origin, or games installed on their own., You won't receive any indication that recording has begun, but OBS will be recording in the background., Again, you won't receive a notification that recording has stopped. The video file will be created, and you'll be able to find it at the location you set earlier. 

download open broadcaster software.  run the installer.  launch obs and open the settings menu.  click the "output" tab in the settings menu.  click the "hotkeys" tab in the settings menu.  create shortcuts for "start record" and "stop recording.",  click the "video" tab in the settings menu to set your recording options.  click the "audio" tab to set your microphone settings.  click the "+" in the "sources" frame and select "game capture.",  start your game.  press your recording hotkey to begin recording.  press the stop hotkey to end your recording. 

 Press and hold your iPhone's home button until you hear two beeps indicating that you can ask Siri a question.; , Speak into your microphone (at the bottom of your phone) naturally as you would with another person, and with clear articulation.

 Open the charge port door.; , This is placed on the case for easy removal.  Then, turn the bottom of the phone so that it is facing away from your body.  Insert it into the small slot to the left of the charge port. Work the coin further into the slot by twisting it slightly.   Continue to do this very gently until you hear a click, indicating the back and front portions are separated. , You should hear another pop when the other side of the latch opens.  Pull the back of the case away from the front, using a back and forth motion toward your body.   You should feel several latches along the side of the case release as you work the back portion away from the front in a seesaw motion. Do not use a peeling motion. Without your hand between the phone/tablet and the back of the case, it will break. , Do the next step above a soft area, such as a bed, in case your phone or tablet falls out of the case quickly.  Try to do this in the middle of the case.  Your phone should pop out of the back. 

locate the charger port on the bottom of the phone or tablet.  find the small slot to the left of the charge port.  flip the case over, so the back is facing upward.  grab a dime or penny.  slide your fingers into the bottom of the case, where the charge port door has opened.  work your fingers in further, between the back of the phone/tablet and the back of the case.  set the back of the case aside.  ,  turn the lifeproof case over.  apply pressure to the front of the case with the surface of your thumbs.  grasp your other fingers around the sides of the case.  peel away any parts that are still attached at a gentle diagonal angle.

 Why do you want to stay up late? You want to because one of your friends dared you to do so? You want to because you just want to be able to tell people that you stayed up all night? Once you find your answer, be determined to stay up all night.; , Do you want to do this with someone or just by yourself? If you want to do it with someone, do it with somebody you can trust, like a close friend. Some people do this at sleepovers. If you want to do it alone, that's fine.  Like your phone, iPod, laptop, notebook and a pencil, or some books and hide them. Keep them in a drawer or under your bed so if your parents come to check up on you before they go to bed, your parents won't be able to identify the items/technology. If you are at a sleepover, depending on how strict the adults are and how late it is, you might not do it.  This is especially important if you know your parents normally check up on you before they go to sleep. You can tell if they're coming if you hear their footsteps on the stairs or in the hallway. Pretend to be asleep, because if people are sleeping, the person looking at them usually won't disturb them. Move around a bit while you're pretend sleeping and snore if you are known to snore in your sleep and if you drool, open your mouth a bit.  Once your parents are in their room/rooms, stop pretend sleeping and try to identify their voices. If you know your parents watch TV before they go to sleep, wait for about 1 or 2 hours before taking out your things and playing with them. If you want to know right away that your parents are asleep, after waiting for 1 hour, quietly and quickly go to their room/rooms and check on them to see if they're sleeping. If they're not, and they ask you why you're up, say that you had heard a noise. Your parents lock their door? Try to hear their voice/voices through the door. If you hear them, quietly and quickly go back to your room and wait for 30-45 minutes.  If your parents are finally asleep, reach under your bed and grab your things. If you put it in a desk drawer, crawl gently across the floor and open the desk drawer, take some of the things you want to play with out and crawl gently across the floor back to your bed. If your parents hear you and come to your room, quickly put your item/items in the closest place possible and do Step 4 again. If they shake you to wake up, groggily open your eyes and say "What?" with a touch of grouchy tone in your voice, to make it seem as if you really were sleeping.  Ask your parents what time they wake up on a specific day. If you're doing this on a weekend, ask your parents what time they wake up on the weekends. If you are doing this on a weekday, ask your parents what time they wake up on a weekday. That way, you know when to stop the all-nighter. Because if you don't know when your parents wake up and when to stop playing with your things, it's going to be awkward when your parents wake you up for school or something and your iPod is right next to your face.  While on your technology, if you plan to play an app that has a lot of noise, like the Temple Run games or the Sims FreePlay, either put earbuds on or mute the game's sound effects, so that way, your parents won't come into your room, take away your technology and probably go through it to find out what you do on your technology.  If you have school or church the next day, 5 hours before you have to get up, put away your technology and go to sleep, since 5 hours of sleep is better than having absolutely no hours of sleep at night.  At breakfast the next day, have an energy bar, a 1-hour nap in the afternoon and a good night's sleep the next night. Going too long without sleep with become a habit and is bad for your health. It's also dangerous.  If you are a teenager and you're allowed to wear makeup, if you have dark circles under your eyes, use concealer/foundation to cover it up. If you aren't allowed to wear makeup and in the morning you realize you have dark circles, the night before, get a paper towel, drench it with cold water, squeeze out excess water, put it in a freezer and in the morning, put the paper towel under your eyes. Don't use ice because ice can kill blood vessels.  

before you do anything, think.  decide whether you want to stay up with someone or fly solo.  get the items/technology you will want to use during this process.  listen for your parents.  listen out after they go to bed.  wait until you're sure they've gone to sleep.  keep track of time.  beware of noise.  get rest when you need to.  start the next day right.  conceal your tiredness. 

 Most middle and high school coaches are also teachers at the school. To become a teacher, you will need a Bachelor’s degree and teaching certification. If you want to focus particularly on sports and exercise, getting a degree in Physical Education might be a good choice for you. This would set you up to coach and to teach any of the health courses your school might have., It doesn't have to be a sport you're especially good at, but it should definitely be a sport you are very passionate about. You need to have a strong command of the techniques necessary to succeed in the sport, the rules of the game, and a capacity to design drills and exercises that can help your team advance.  Most sports have a governing body that will issue certifications to coaches. Check on the sport or sports of your choice to see what the specifics are. All certifications, however, will include a background check, questions about your experience playing or coaching your sport or sports, and knowledge of the sport or sports., It's best to become an assistant coach before you do the real thing, so that you will have experience and know what to expect as a coach. Try to volunteer for the sport and the level that you hope to coach. As school budgets decline, many schools are in desperate need of volunteer coaches and assistants., Observe coaches around you to see what their technique is. Learn the best ways to model and explain how you want your players to perform. Work on your responses to typical player issues, including technique, performance anxiety, or teamwork. Consider supplementing what you already know with online courses from the National Federation of State High School Associations, which offers classes specifically for coaches here: http://nfhslearn.com/   How do you want to talk to and treat your team to get them to perform their best? What kinds of drills work best to get your team to play the way you want them to? Think about a coach that has inspired you. How did he or she act to inspire you to be a better player? Are you going to be a hands-on coach, and model the techniques you want, or will you be on the sidelines, explaining what you want to your team? What is your philosophy of coaching?  , Hopefully you will be able to get a job as a teacher and be able to coach the team of your choice. Keep in mind, however, that it might take a while. You could end up with a teaching job and no coaching job. This would mean that you should continue to volunteer to keep up your coaching skills.  

get the education to become a teacher.  choose the sport or sports that you want to coach.  get certified.  volunteer.  hone your coaching skills.  get a job as a coach. 

 Be sure to use plain white vinegar. Apple cider vinegar is less acidic, so it won't be as effective.         Most dyes are meant to handle alkaline substances, like soaps and shampoos, but not acidic substances. The acidity of white vinegar will help to remove the dye.  Over a sink or tub, douse your hair with the vinegar and water solution. Get your hair good and saturated.  Use a shower cap or plastic bag to wrap up your wet hair. Allow your hair to soak in the vinegar mixture for 15 to 20 minutes.  As you rinse, you'll see color running out with the water. Once the water runs clear, shampoo it again. You can repeat this entire process several times if you need to.         

create a mixture of equal parts vinegar and warm water.  saturate your hair with the mixture.  cover your hair and wait 15 to 20 minutes.  shampoo your hair and rinse it thoroughly. 

 Photos and images from the web are ravenous data munchers, and if you're on a phone plan with a data limit, they can really jack up your phone bill.

 Rinse the zucchini under cool water, then pat them dry with a paper towel. Line the mixing bowl with a thin hand towel or cheesecloth. Use a medium or fine grater to reduce the zucchini to small shreds, allowing it to collect on top of the towel.There are lots of beneficial nutrients in the zucchini peels, so leave them on. 3 medium-sized zucchini should be enough to make a little over a dozen meatballs.; , Gather the corners of the towel and lift the zucchini out of the bowl. Hold the towel-wrapped zucchini over the sink and give it a squeeze. This will help extract any remaining water.You can also heat the zucchini in a pan for a few minutes to evaporate the extra liquid.Zucchini naturally has a high water content, which can ruin the flavor and texture of the finished meatballs.  Return the grated zucchini to the mixing bowl. Add one egg, two cloves crushed garlic, one cup seasoned bread crumbs, one half cup freshly grated parmesan cheese, three tablespoons chopped basil and a dash of salt and pepper to taste. Blend the ingredients until they’re distributed throughout the mixture.Together, the egg, breadcrumbs and cheese will serve as a binding agent to help the meatballs retain their shape. Crush the garlic cloves using a manual press, or pulse it in the food processor along with the basil to save time.  Grab a small handful of the zucchini mixture and use the palms of both hands to roll them. Try to use roughly one ounce of zucchini per meatball. Make sure each meatball has been pressed firmly to ensure that they’ll hold together while cooking.The meatballs will shrink somewhat as they cook. If you find that your meatballs are falling apart, add a small amount of flour to the mixture and try again. The flour will soak up moisture and become slightly sticky., Set the oven to convection and make sure the center rack is clear. Let the oven begin warming up while you finish preparing the meatballs.Keeping the temperature relatively low will prevent you from accidentally burning the cheese and breadcrumbs.  Lay out the meatballs in rows. Leave an inch or two of space between each to allow heat to circulate properly.Use a deep or rimmed baking sheet in case the meatballs slide around while in the oven.If you’re not using a nonstick baking sheet, grease it with cooking spray first.  Dip a basting brush in the oil and lightly go over the tops of the meatballs. Oil will help the meatballs cook up nice and crisp and give them a crusty golden-brown exterior.Olive oil will provide the most complementary flavor to the seasonings in the meatballs.  Place the meatballs in the oven and set a timer. Keep an eye on them as they bake so they don’t get too done. If you wish, you can turn the meatballs over at the halfway point, though convection heat should help them cook evenly throughout.Remove the meatballs from the oven and use a pair of tongs or fork to gently nudge them over. Give the meatballs a few minutes to cool before serving them.  If you’d prefer your meatballs to have a crispier texture, or if you’d like to shave a few minutes off the cook time, you also have the option of frying them on the stovetop. Cover the bottom of a large skillet with half an inch of olive or canola oil. Drop in the meatballs and pan fry for 3-5 minutes on each side until brown.Set the pan fried meatballs on a layer of paper towels to absorb excess oil as they cool. Panko breadcrumbs hold up better to frying than other varieties., Transfer the hot meatballs to a saucepan and simmer them with tangy marinara or vodka sauce for 5 minutes. Or, enjoy them Swedish-style in a creamy sauce seasoned with black pepper, nutmeg and allspice. There’s really no wrong way to savor these marvelous meat-free morsels.Finish Italian meatballs with red pepper flakes or balsamic vinegar to coax more flavor out of the mild zucchini. Be careful not to stew or simmer zucchini meatballs for too long, as this can cause them to become soggy.  Zucchini meatballs can easily become a complete meal with the addition of spaghetti, linguine or penne cooked perfectly al dente. Top with fresh oregano and extra grated parmesan and serve with crusty Italian bread.Go with whole wheat pasta to cut down on calories. While you’re at it, try making zoodles using a mandoline or spiralizer for an all-zucchini meal!, Vegetarian meatballs can make a perfect finger food for your next holiday party or get together.

Their small sizes makes them easy to eat, and their rich, delicious flavor makes them hard to resist.Experiment with different dipping sauces, as well, such as a spicy currant jelly, smoky garlic ketchup or lemon-dill remoulade. 

grate fresh zucchini into a large mixing bowl.  squeeze the excess moisture out of the zucchini.  combine the zucchini with the egg, breadcrumbs and herbs.  roll the mixture into golf ball-sized balls.  preheat the oven to 375 °f (191 °c).  arrange the zucchini meatballs on a nonstick baking sheet.  brush the meatballs with a coat of olive oil.  bake for 20-25 minutes.  pan fry the meatballs instead.  smother the meatballs in your favorite sauce.  pair meatballs with nutritious pasta.  offer zucchini meatballs as an hors d'oeuvre. 

 This is the first and most important step, but it's generally easy and free.  You may need identification or proof of residence.

Many libraries subscribe to research databases, online repositories of magazine and journal articles, online lessons and classes, e-books, music services, and much more. A librarian can suggest resources for you and help get you started using any technology that is not familiar.  Many public libraries have places to sit and read, as well as group study or conference rooms. , Some public libraries even circulate laptops or e-readers. Or, use your own device with a public connection.  Find out if your library has classes, workshops, talks, author readings, concerts, story time for kids, or other events.

; , The texture helps prevent plaque from building up on teeth.   Consider buying a food specifically formulated for a cat's oral health.  These toys help prevent unhealthy accumulations of plaque and tartar. They also massage your cat's gums, which stimulates healthy circulation.  Human food causes plaque and tartar to gather on teeth, leading to periodontal disease.  These treats remove plaque and freshen breath. , The vet will examine your cat and recommend treatment, if necessary. Even if you brush your cat's teeth, your pet will likely need to have its teeth cleaned by a veterinarian occasionally.  

brush your cat's teeth every day.  serve hard, crunchy food to your cat.  give dental health chews to your cat.  refrain from feeding leftovers or sweets to your cat.  feed dental treats to your cat.  put an oral health additive in your cat's water to help control plaque and tartar.  ,  take your cat to a veterinarian for regular dental checkups. 

 If you have any connections to the person, solidify them ahead of time. Give them a call to say you’d be happy to donate some services if it is a charity event.; , First-time networkers should start with a goal like meeting two new people or getting two business cards. Experienced extroverts may want to try to garner an invite to an exclusive society or community service organization.  Keep your body language positive, including arms relaxed at your sides, legs planted at hip width apart, nodding and smiling. If you have weak posture, get in the habit of standing up straight.   Avoid crossing your arms and legs when you sit and stand. These are negative and defensive postures that might work against you.       Get used to eye contact. You should be able to look someone in the eyes as you meet them, but break eye contact before you start to stare.Don’t be afraid to talk with your hands. It’s better to gesticulate to make a point than to cross your arms or touch your neck and face. It shows confidence, just like eye contact and a wide stance., Bring them along so that you can easily trade contact information. Keep a pen on hand in case you want to write a personal message to a new acquaintance.  If you are starting a new business, looking for investors or trying to gain support for a cause, you should have a 30-second persuasive speech ready. Practice incorporating it comfortably into everyday speech, so that it doesn’t sound rehearsed., Research how most people dress for the event and adopt a similar appearance. Looking professional and put-together will work in your favor when trying to start conversations.  Stick it on the upper right hand side, below your shoulder. Right handed people will be drawn to look there when they shake your hand., They will be more open to striking up a conversation with a stranger. Keep in mind that it may be harder to leave a single person and a group when you want to create other connections, so make sure you don’t talk to one person the entire night.  Three people usually have room for one more in their conversation. Choose groups of three that are standing in open formation, with room in between or near the perimeter; these groups are a better bet than people standing close and whispering., Placing yourself by a buffet or registration table will make you more likely to see people you know, introduce yourself to organizers and pick out people you’ve been wanting to meet.  Show that you remember names and personal information by taking a leading role in a group conversation. You can become the glue that holds other people together.  Your goal is to make new connections, so tell your friends ahead of time if you think they will be offended. Ask them to introduce you to people if they have good connections.  Don’t try anything too complicated or humorous. The following are simple ways to start talking to people.   Compliment the person’s taste in drinks if it appears you are drinking the same thing.       Try commenting on the hors d’oeuvres, the weather or sports. These topics are seen as “ice-breakers” so the person will understand your intention.       Ask what company the person is associated with.       Ask for a person’s impression. Many people like to share opinions, so don’t be afraid to say “What do you think of the theme this year?”Avoid being negative. Don’t make the first thing you say to a person a negative comment. You are setting the tone for a negative interaction, rather than a positive one.  Use a firm, three second shake while you maintain eye contact.  Don’t dig too deep, but show an interest. Most people will eventually ask you how you are associated with the organizer or the event.   Avoid yes or no questions, especially at the beginning of a conversation. They give a person an excuse to say very little and excuse themselves.  Spend the majority of the time listening, rather than talking about yourself. If you are patient, the people you talk to will hit on a topic of mutual interest that will strengthen a conversation.   Note these mutual interests so that you can remember them the next time you meet.  You won’t click with everyone, so accept that some rejection will be part of a networking event. Move on quickly to a new group or person, rather than taking it personally.  Volunteering your services to a community or charity goal can improve a relationship and the connection that you just made.  Many people make the mistake of giving them to everyone. Make it a special connection while a person you want to be in touch with in the future.

 Whenever they insult you, just ignore them, don't even look at them when they insult you.; , Doing this will make them do it even more and not feel sorry for you because they will think it annoys you and makes you mad, but not enough to make you dislike them and not/never talk to them anymore.  If they are one of those cousins who you always talk to a lot, start making your conversations shorter and shorter each time you see them, and make sure people notice so when you don't talk at all, people won't notice or think anything of it and they won't know that you are trying to make this person guilty. Having people notice you talking to someone less and less is better than having them notice seeing you ignore your cousin, right?  , If they stare at you, do not take any notice of them. If they try talking to you, act like you didn't hear them, keep saying "What? What? What? What did you say"? each time they repeat what they say to you, or you can simply act as if you forgot about them,or you can act as if you don't even know who they are when they talk to you.  Never talk to them, look at them, text and/or call them. If anyone takes notice of this just say you forgot about them, and if the person that noticed acts mad, just act like you don't care at all or you can act confused, or you can act both ways and they will probably simply get over it seeing you not caring and acting as if it's nothing and not a big deal at all.  This will show them you are better off without them.  

ignore your cousin when they insult you.  don't insult your cousin back.  talk to them less.  don't take any notice of them.  act like they don't exist.  let them always see you hanging out with and having fun with other people, and most importantly, be yourself and leave your cousin out. 

 These live rabbit traps consist of a cage with a trigger plate forces the door of the trap closed once the rabbit triggers the plate by entering into the cage. You can choose between one door or two door traps, but you'll want a trap that is 22 to 30 inches in length. You can often purchase these online or at an animal feed or hardware store or make your own rabbit trap. Havahart is a popular brand for rabbit traps.The one and door two traps are both effective traps, but have different benefits. The one door trap is favored by professional trappers and it allows you to place the rabbit bate behind the trigger plate, which lures the rabbit further into the cage. The two door trap allows the rabbit to enter the cage from both directions, thus providing a higher catch rate for rabbits. Rabbits will also become nervous or fearful once in the trap, but having a two door trap allows the rabbit to see through the trap, which can be comforting for the rabbit. The two door trap can also be set as a one door trap if desired.; , Determine where you have the most rabbit activity and place a trap along that area. Rabbits don't often cross stretches of land, so avoid placing a trap in an area that would require the rabbit to be vulnerable. You'll want to place your trap on a flat surface, placing a small weight on top of the trap so that other animals cannot tip it over to reach the bait.   Rabbits are often in areas where they have cover and open land. Common areas rabbits are located are hedges, shrubs, trees, fence lines, tall grass, wood and brush piles, bushes, and tree lines. These are the locations you'll likely have the most success in catching a rabbit. If you are able to locate a rabbit's den or warren (rabbit hole), then place the trap a few feet from the entrance. You can often locate areas where rabbits have been by their droppings, which are dry, round pellets.  Choose a bait that is likely to attract rabbits and place bait behind trigger plate. In the winter, dried foods are better because they are less likely to freeze and in the summer, when food is abundant for rabbits, choosing richer fruits or vegetables, like apples and carrots, will be more effective in trapping a rabbit.   If you are using a one door trap, place bait at the end of the cage, behind the trap opening. If you are using a two door trap, place bait between the two doors, in the center of the trap. Some baits to use for rabbits are fruits and vegetables like apple cores, bananas, potato peelings, lettuce leafs, raw cabbage, carrots, dandelions, and leafy weeds. If you find traditional baits aren't producing success, you can try using baits that are more unusual. Some ideas for these types of baits are cheesy biscuits crumbled up and peanut butter. Rabbits may be able to smell your scent on the trap and will avoid the trap because they feel that something is wrong. To cover up your scent, drip or spray apple cider onto the trap., Now that you have placed your bait, it's time to set your trap. Follow the trap's instructions explaining how to set your trap. After you have set your trap, you'll want to check the trigger to make sure it is working properly. Gently press down on the trip plate, and the doors should immediately snap closed.If the rabbit you are trying to trap is on the smaller side, they may not be able to trip the trigger, so place a small weight on the trigger plate so that the combined weight of the two will be enough to make the trap effective. It could also be good to camouflage your trap with twigs and leaves, because a metal trap can produce a glare in the sun, causing the rabbit to avoid it.  After you have set your trap, you'll want to check it often to see if you have caught a rabbit. If a rabbit is caught and you neglect your trap, the rabbit can quickly become malnourished, so you want to check the trap daily to prevent harming the rabbit.   Keep in mind you may accidentally trap other animals in your trap. Raccoons are often lured into rabbit traps as well as other animals, so if you catch another animal release it immediately. You may find that you are not having much success with your trap if you are trying to catch a rabbit in the summer. That's because during the summer, rabbits often have a much higher supply of food and nutrients available to them. The best time to trap a rabbit is in the winter, when food is more scarce and the rabbit will be in search of food.  If you have checked your trap and found a rabbit in it, be careful when removing the rabbit as it is probably scared and may bite you. Consider wearing gloves when removing the rabbit to prevent disease from spreading if it bites you, and approach it cautiously to prevent from frightening it even further.If you have caught a rabbit in hopes to keep it from destroying your garden or flowerbeds, then relocate the rabbit at least five miles away, if local law permits. Try placing the rabbit in a covered area, for extra protection.  

choose a rabbit trap.  pick a location for your trap.  place bait in trap.  set your trap.  check your trap often.  be careful in handling the rabbit.

The higher the level of the map, the tougher and higher tier equipment needed to fish. If you plan on fishing at a level 45+ map, it's advisable that you get a better fishing rod, bait, and equipment.  After choosing a fishing spot, head to it and stand on dry land or shallow water. Click on the Fishing icon in the water to throw out your line. A circular window will appear on your screen with an image of a fishing line. There are three different fishing modes available:   Passive - This is the default fishing mode. As soon as you cast out your line, your character goes into Passive mode, and will automatically pull in fish until you are either out of bait or your inventory is full. This is great for farming equipment such as the Green fishing set. You cannot catch Orange fish in passive mode. Active - In this mode, you control your rod. To do this, once a fish takes your bait, click the fish icon in the circular window to start reeling. See the next Step for details on how to fish in Active mode. Active Mode is time-consuming and has a greater possibility of bandits appearing. Semi-Active - In this mode, you will control your rod whenever you desire. For instance, if your indicator shows that a weak fish caught your bait, you can leave it to passive. If the indicator tells you that you caught a powerful fish, you can take control to successfully catch it. This mode is still time-consuming, and bandits may still spawn.  This is the only way to catch valuable Orange fish, so it pays to start practicing early. The goal is to keep the moving bar in the blue area to avoid damaging the durability of your rod. There are a few things to keep your eye on during Active fishing:   Target Durability - This is the fish's "health". When the bar empties, the fish is caught. Fishing Equipment Durability - This is your "health". When the bar empties, your line will break and the fish will get away. Fishing window - This is where you click to start Active fishing, and displays an image of the fish in the water. Click here to reel the fish in. Fish slider - This is located to the right of the Fishing window. As you fight the fish, the slider will move to the left and right. Clicking and holding in the Fishing window will move the slider to the left, releasing it will move it to the right. Try to keep it in the Blue section to lower the Target Durability. Both the Red and Orange sections will lower your Equipment Durability, and the Orange section will heal the fish.  Fishing while in a party will double the tokens gained. It's advisable that you have only one other player in a party to avoid killing each other's Bandit spawn. Bandit spawn gives you tokens that can be used to buy lucky bags.  When you're just starting out, you'll only have some basic fishing gear. While you can use this to start catching fish, you'll want to upgrade quickly in order to get the good stuff. An easy way to get these upgrades is to AFK fish using the Passive method.   Purchase about 500 Blue worms as bait. Clear out your inventory. You'll want as much space as possible before you start AFK fishing, as you'll stop as soon as your inventory is full. Start fishing. Your goal is to get as many Blue boxes as possible. These can contain Green fishing gear, which will give you a significant boost in stats.  When you're active fishing, bandits will occasionally appear when you catch larger fish.   Penguin Bandit - This purple-colored Bandit spawns whenever you catch a big Green fish. When killed, Penguin Bandit will drop a token that you can trade in Navea. A Lucky Bag from a Penguin Bandit will give you a chance to obtain a Tier 2 Penguin Bandit set or Orange ingredients. Nymphet - This pink-colored Bandit appears whenever you capture an orange fish. Once killed, Nymphets will drop tokens that you can trade for a lucky bag. Lucky bags from Nymphets contain yellow ingredients and a Tier 3 Nymphet set. Nebuchadnezzar - This blue-colored Bandit spawns whenever you capture the legendary King Fish. Once killed, it will drop tokens that can be used to purchase a Lucky Bag containing a couple of yellow ingredients and a Tier 4 Nebuchadnezzar set.  To increase your fishing stat, you need a proper fishing gear, which can greatly help you in capturing King fish. To successfully choose a good stat for your character, you need to understand their uses.   Line - Line stats determine the safety zone of your reeling bar. Fishing gear with high Line makes your blue safety zone in the slider wider. Rod - All fish have strength; the higher the strength they have, the longer it takes to have their Durability reduced to 0. Fishing gear with high Rod stats shorten the time needed. It's advisable that your Rod stat be at least 10 points higher than the King Fish's strength. Reel - Fishing gear with high Reel gives you control to the movement of the bobber, which is good against fish with high speed. If you're going to capture King Fish, make sure that your Reel stat is much higher compared to your prey. The hardest King Fish to catch is the Crystal Lobster since it possesses a speed of 610.  The King Fish is a legendary fish in Aura Kingdom. Hunting it is a global event where any players can participate as long as they have a high-tier fishing set and the required bait to capture the fish. Most King Fish baits are acquired by doing daily fishing quests or can be purchased from the Fishing NPC using your tokens. When the King Fish event is active, a yellow fish icon will appear on your map, indicating the King Fish's location.  

get a fishing rod.  choose your bait.  wear fishing equipment.  find a good fishing spot.  start fishing.  fish in active mode.  join a party.  farm for good gear.  kill bandits for big rewards.  increase your fishing stat.  hunt for king fish. 

 If you are nervous about public speaking, flirting on dates, or doing a good job at work practice can make you more confident and alleviate nerves. The more experience you have, the more used to the situation you will feel. If you are nervous about dating, try getting a friend to go on a practice date with you. Go to the place where you plan to have your date and practice having conversations and doing the activities you will do on the date. If you are nervous about public speaking, seek out opportunities to practice talking in public. Volunteer to talk in your class at school when there are opportunities. Attend a public meeting and voice your opinion.The more you get a chance to practice, the less nervous you will be.; , Preparation for the specific task that makes you nervous will make you feel ready and self-assured.For a big meeting, plan out how the meeting will unfold and outline important information you may need so you can have it ready. For a job interview, do research on the company and the position so you can speak knowledgeably. Try to think of some potential questions that may come up and plan out your answers in advance. For a date, think about questions you can ask your date about themselves. If there are any lulls in conversation you can have an interesting question ready and not have to come up with things to say.  Visualize yourself doing well and not being nervous. Walk through the event that makes you nervous in your head and imagine yourself calm and successful.For a date, imagine the date going well and that you both are relaxed and having a good time. For a big speech, visualize yourself in front of your audience. Think about yourself giving a relaxed and successful presentation. See your audience enjoying your speech.  Try to relax yourself ahead of time to reduce nervousness. Take a few minutes before situations that make you nervous and try to work out your nervous energy and get relaxed.   Try sitting in a dark, quiet room to calm your mind. Progressively relax your body. Tighten and then relax each of your muscles. Start at the top of your body and work your way down. Tighten your shoulder muscles then relax them. Tighten your arm muscles then relax them, and so on. Go for a walk to get out some nervous energy and clear your mind.  Try to think about your breathing and take slow, deep breaths.Thinking about breathing slowly not only calms you down physically, but can also distract you from your nervousness. Take ten deep breaths while thinking about the air moving in through your nose, filling your lungs, and moving out through your mouth. This might make you feel focused and calm.  Use some simple steps to avoid sweating too much when you are nervous.   Wear cooler clothes. Use a strong antiperspirant. Avoid wearing hats.  Even if you feel nervous try not to fidget around nervously.   Stand still instead of shifting your weight from side to side. Hold your hands loosely at your sides instead of making nervous gestures. Hold a pen in your hand if it helps you remember not to fidget.  Ask yourself why you are nervous and whether your feelings are really founded. Think about what could really go wrong and consider that the worst outcome you imagine would not be so bad.  Others can not tell how nervous you are so don't worry about appearing too nervous. Often people feel much more nervous than they appear. 

practice whatever makes you nervous.  prepare in advance.  think positively.  relax your body.  concentrate on your breathing.  reduce sweating from nervousness.  reduce nervous movements.  rationalize the situation.  remember that nobody knows you're nervous. 

 If they tell the teacher that you ignored him or her, tell the teacher that s/he was bullying you and that he or she is bothering you! (Have good bonds with the teacher(s) in order to do this) Never make the teacher hate you, s/he won't believe you and you will end up getting in trouble.; , Don't be afraid to be called "tattletale", as you are doing the right thing by telling someone. If you don't feel comfortable telling them face to face, then write them a letter explaining your situation and give it to them. They will then most likely read it and approach you, wanting to assist you.  If you think that your 'friend' is actually a backstabber or a frenemy, stop being friends with this person immediately.  When they bully you, instead of fighting back, get away. Do it for your own safety, and if they chase you go to where there are other people. If they don't give up, go to the principal office as soon as you can, or go to a teacher who is nearby. If you don't do this quickly, the bully might see you and tell the teacher lies.  Don't use high kicks, as the bully will just grab your leg and pull you down. When the bully gives up, don't become the bully by further hurting him or her, instead just calmly walk away. , Be honest but don't be overly dramatic. No principal wants students getting hurt in their school.  This really helps! When a bully gets close your group, they will protect you from him or her. The bully may not even approach you. If you don't have any friends, just try to stay as far away as possible from that bully or stay within sight of a teacher.  Become friends with old bullies, or at least neutral friends. Be as kind as possible.  You probably have worked a long time to get here.  Get more aggressive in trying to stop it instead of being intimidated. Talk with people around you, find out who else is hurt by that bully, and help them. Report the bully to the principal. Aggressively fight back (without being too physical). Don't let them see that you are bothered by what they say.  Someone is bullying you! Don't just stand there and take it, stand up for yourself. This may be a lot harder than it sounds but if you do it, afterwards, you'll feel great. If you are not convinced that you have the courage, know what you want to say and who you want to say it to when you are standing up for yourself.  When standing up for yourself, you have to know what to say and what not to say. The right thing to do, no matter how far it goes, is to avoid being mean. For example, if someone says something like, "Nice shirt... not!" to you, or something to diss you, you can say something back, that is not mean, but surprises them like, "Thanks! I like your shirt too!" Don't be sarcastic when saying this, sound genuine.  Most likely, when you are getting bullied, you will be surrounded by a group. These can be your friends, or enemies. No matter who they are, you need to stand up for yourself. You may hear someone make fun of you for simply standing up for yourself. Some people may not even support the idea of you standing up for yourself.  There are times that you can actually put a stop to a bullying situation. The greatest step to doing this is standing up for who you are and standing up for your friends. If someone insults you again and you are finally done with the bullying, you can say something along the lines of, "You know what, I am tired of you bullying me! You may be insecure about yourself or just not like me, but that is no reason to do the things you are doing right now."  , Often times, bullies want the attention, and get the attention. They want to start a fight and hurt the other person's feelings/emotions. Don't show them, and don't let them hurt your feelings. The person may be embarrassed, but you were too when you were being bullied. Your bully heard what you were saying when you stood up for yourself and in their heart, knows that it's wrong to do what they did.  

ignore mean comments.  tell the teacher, a trusted adult, or friend about any bullying that you or someone else experiences and tell them how you feel about it.  beware of frenemies and back-stabbers.  run away from a physical bully.  defend yourself only if you can't get away.  if you are socially bullied and have no friends, learn how to cope without friends and tell the principal as soon as possible.  ,  develop a positive relationship with your principal and never be afraid of explaining your troubles.  stay with a group of friends.  start eliminating problems one step at a time.  once you're down to one bully or no bullies, congratulate yourself.  don't let extra aggressiveness from the bully stop you.  stand up for yourself.  know what to say to the bully.  deal with peer pressure.  try to end the actual bullying.  avoid starting a fight. 

 Once you have your own account, try playing the game for a while and levelling up until you get to around rank 15 or so. This will help you develop a good feel for the game's mechanics and allow other players to take your levels more seriously.; , Once you've gained enough experience in PR2, it's time to start looking for ideas for your level. Try to think of what type of level you wish to make. If you can't decide for yourself, check out some of the levels that are under the "Today's Best" and "All-Time Best" tabs. Many of these levels are typically made by higher-ranked players who can often be of great influence since they've been around the block quite a few times and know plenty of good tricks.  As soon as you have a level concept that you're happy with, you can finally begin building your level. It's wise to start by adding your players' starting positions. You can allow your players to start a race/match normally or go even further by incorporating a hat remover or a santa/crown/cowboy hat filter into each of your players' starting positions.  Try to use a variety of different block types, but make sure that you're actually making the race/match more fun instead of just tacking on extraneous features. If you're stuck, try experimenting with some blocks and placing them in unique places. The possibilities are endless, and this can give you a chance to exploit some glitches as well.  In PR2, art is the best way to add a personal spin to your level as well as make it appear much more professional to your players. Draw on layers 00 through 0 if you want your art to overlap the player and the blocks, and draw on layers 1 through 3 for art that only appears in the background. If you're having trouble drawing sophisticated designs with your mouse or touchpad, simple colorful line designs distributed throughout your level will work just fine. Use the preloaded landscape art sparingly; don't add too many trees/cactuses/rocks/etc. as your level will look very rushed if you do. On the other hand, PR2's text tool can be very useful, but avoid writing huge blocks of text as this can distract the players too much.  As soon as you feel that your level is just about done, the only thing you have to do left before publishing it is to test it. This is your chance to look for any problems in your level and think of any possible improvements you can make. Such questions as "Is my level good enough?" and "What do I want to fix/add?" are very useful here. Make sure that you are able to win the level entirely on your own. If you are making a level that requires more than one player, you can always put a temporary password on your level (while keeping it unpublished) and ask a group of friends to help test it out with you. If you don't want people playing your level while wearing a specific hat, be sure to make note of that at the beginning of the level AND in your level description.  As soon as you are completely satisfied with your level, it is time to publish it for everyone to play. Make sure you add a very fitting and attractive name; an unfitting name will give someone a reason to rate your level low, and a more generic name won't catch a player's eye as easily. Add a description that briefly describes what your level is all about; don't make it too long or part of it will be cut off when it's being viewed. Remember: More people will notice your level while more people are online. If you have to, save your level and wait until a time of day when the servers are most active to publish it.  Most of the time, your level isn't going to be perfect on the first go. Don't be afraid to ask other players and moderators for help and feedback; they'll be more than happy to give you suggestions. You can edit your level as many times as you want to your heart's content. The more you fix it up, the better it's going to be and the higher its rating is going to be.  Done already? Who said you had to stop at just one brilliant level? You can make as many levels as you want! The more levels you make, the higher your popularity will increase. And the best part is that all your other levels will get even more attention and higher ratings!  

get some experience.if you haven't done so already, go create an account in pr2.  start looking for ideas.  start building your level.  use a variety of blocks and experiment with them.  make your level fancy.  test your level.  publish your level.  tweak your level and publish it again.  make another one! 

 A licensed surveyor will use the legal description contained in your deed to locate your property's legal boundary.You typically can find a land surveyor by searching the website of your state's licensing board.Expect to pay around $500 up-front for a land survey, although the surveyor's fees will vary depending on your location and the size of your lot.The surveyor typically will place posts or other markers to identify the legal property line. This will give you an idea of where the line actually is and how much (if any) property is being encroached upon.If your neighbor is unaware that you believe there is a boundary issue, you may want to bring it up with him or her casually before a surveyor comes out and starts putting stakes or flags in the ground. Otherwise, the presence of the surveyor may be seen as a rather hostile action and put your neighbor on the defensive.; , You need to know the market value of your property and the portion of property along the boundary that is in dispute.Professional associations such as the Appraisal Institute have online directories you can search to find a licensed and certified appraiser in your area.If you had an appraisal done when you bought your house, you could probably use it. However, if it's been awhile since you first bought the property you should consider getting a new one so your information is up to date. Once you get an appraisal of the entire property, divide it by the acreage or square footage of your lot, whichever is most applicable, to find out how each unit of your property is worth. When you determine the amount of land affected by the property line dispute, you then have an estimate of the approximate value of the land in dispute.  There may be recorded documents such as easements that affect your ownership interest or the legal boundary of your property.You can pay for a title search company to do this work for you, or you can Search Property Titles on the Internet on your own. Keep in mind that if you purchased a title insurance policy when you bought your house, the title company may be responsible for any costs you incur as a result of the property line dispute. If you took out a mortgage to finance your purchase, your mortgage lender probably required title insurance. Check with your mortgage lender to find out if you have title insurance.  Even if you ultimately do not proceed to litigation, an attorney can help you analyze the information you have and determine your legal rights.In some cases, it may be that you are in fact encroaching on your neighbor's policy and the law is not on your side. If you are unable to reach an agreement with your neighbor, a lawsuit would be inadvisable since you probably would lose.  Even though you may talk to your neighbor casually about the situation, any communications with your neighbor regarding the boundary dispute should be in writing.Keep your letter polite, and stress that you want to find a resolution to the dispute. If you've had a survey, appraisal, or title search conducted, let your neighbor know and assure him or her that you will share that information at the meeting. If the boundary dispute arose because of an improvement project you are contemplating, or one that your neighbor has started, make sure you mention that in your letter.  Typically a personal meeting is better for negotiations than a back-and-forth through written letters that are subject to misinterpretation.A neutral location typically is the best place for you to meet, but you also could meet in either of your homes. Just make sure the meeting place is somewhere you feel comfortable. Both of you should plan on bringing any legal documents or other information you have about your respective properties to the meeting.  Being open with your neighbor about the results of any survey, appraisal, or title search you had done on your property ensures you're both working with the same facts.Keep in mind that the dispute may be the result of a misunderstanding or bad information. For example, your neighbor's deed may state he owns the property in dispute, while your deed states you own that property.  After viewing your information, your neighbor may wish to have his or her own assessment done of the property in dispute.Your neighbor also may want to get the same information about his or her property. If he or she suggests that, make sure you request a copy of those results as well. A reasonable time typically would be a month to six weeks. You don't want the dispute to go on indefinitely, and you shouldn't allow your neighbor to use an independent assessment as a stall tactic. Provide a firm deadline, and stress that you want the situation resolved as quickly as possible.  With full information, you both can present your ideal outcomes of the dispute and work towards a compromise.If the area and value of the land is relatively small, you may want to simply pay for the use of the land and amend the corresponding deeds to reflect that exchange. Another option is to suggest paying a small amount each month – or even annually – to rent the land in question. If the property line dispute concerns a tree or the like that is encroaching on your neighbor's property, you might suggest trimming the branches so they don't extend over the property line, or coming over to your neighbor's place periodically to clean under the tree or rake leaves.  If the two of you manage to settle your property line dispute through negotiation, make sure you write the agreement down.Once in writing and signed by both you and your neighbor, the agreement becomes a legally binding contract. If you made a decision regarding the location of the boundary line, you and your neighbor may need to update your deeds to reflect the agreement. If you need to write a new deed, make sure you record it with your county records office.  Before you hire a mediator, you must get your neighbor on board with the idea, so send your neighbor a letter proposing mediation and explaining its benefits.Generally, a mediator is a neutral third party who is trained to help two parties find common ground and resolve a dispute between them amicably. Mediation is by its very nature not adversarial, and typically is less expensive and time consuming than going to trial. For this reason, it's a far more beneficial way to resolve your dispute than suing your neighbor. A mediator also has the ability to help you generate options to resolve the dispute that wouldn't be available in court, such as coming up with a way for you and your neighbor to share the land. Keep in mind that since mediation is voluntary, the process can't go ahead unless both of you agree.  You and your neighbor should work together to choose a mediator who will be neutral and who will best meet your needs, avoiding anyone who may know either of you.Many cities and counties have community mediation programs that can assist you and your neighbor in your dispute. Contact your city or county office, or check with your local court clerk. Local bar associations also often have links to mediation services on their websites.  Get your documents and other evidence together to take with you to mediation, including any surveys, appraisals, or title searches.Make sure you've set enough time for the mediation session. Disputes between neighbors typically can be resolved in a few hours, unless peripheral issues arise during the process. If time runs out and there are still issues on the table that you want to resolve, the mediator may arrange a second session.  You and your neighbor will meet the mediator, and he or she will explain a little about the process and what you can expect from mediation.The mediator typically will lay some ground rules, although generally mediations are much less formal than court proceedings and don't follow technical legal rules such as the rules of evidence. Make sure you understand the mediation process and ask any questions before the session starts.  Typically the mediator allows each party to make a brief statement explaining his or her side of the dispute.You will describe the dispute in your own words and provide some ideas for how you think the dispute should be resolved. After you speak, your neighbor will have the opportunity to explain his or her take on the matter. Avoid reacting to what your neighbor says, or interrupting him or her. If you have any questions, you may ask them after your neighbor has finished speaking unless the mediator instructs otherwise. Once both opening statements are made, the mediator may open a joint discussion about what was said and see if there are any specific facts on which both of you can agree at the outset.  Following opening statements, the mediator typically will separate you and your neighbor and speak with each of you privately.The mediator may go back and forth between you and your neighbor several times. He or she will help you realize the strengths and weaknesses of your argument, or suggest areas where you and your neighbor could easily compromise. Keep in mind that the outcome of mediation is entirely in the control of you and your neighbor. The mediator may make suggestions, but he or she can't make a decision for you or force you to agree to any resolution.  If you reach a settlement as a result of the mediation, the mediator typically will write it up for you.Read over the document before you sign it and make sure it says what you believed and understood the agreement to be. If you don't understand something or have any questions, ask for clarification before you sign the document. Keep in mind that although mediation itself is not a legally binding process, the written agreement will become a legally binding contract once you and your neighbor sign it. If any part of the agreement requires you to update your deeds, make sure new deeds are drawn up and recorded with your county recorder's office. If you are unable to resolve the dispute either through independent negotiation or mediation, you may have to file a quiet title lawsuit to ask a judge to determine where the property line lies.  If surveys, negotiation, and mediation are unsuccessful in settling your boundary dispute, you may need to hire an attorney and file a lawsuit to have a judge resolve the boundaries between the two properties.Keep in mind that filing a lawsuit typically will be much more expensive than getting a survey done or attending mediation. In addition to your filing fees and attorney's fees, the judge may order another survey to determine the boundary line. Any agreements you've made with your neighbor regarding the boundary may be thrown out by the judge if they conflict with the survey. 

hire a licensed surveyor.  get an appraisal.  have a full title search performed.  consider consulting an attorney.  send your neighbor a letter.  schedule a face-to-face meeting.  share your information.  give your neighbor time to get an independent assessment.  discuss options for resolving the dispute.  create a written agreement.  talk to your neighbor.  choose a mediator.  prepare for your appointment.  attend your appointment.  present your opening statement.  work with the mediator.  get any agreement in writing.  file a quiet title lawsuit. 

 The best flowers for drying are sturdy, with a small calyx and tightly enclosed petals. Experiment with any flowers and herbs that interest you, but the best candidates for drying are amaranth, artemisia, aster, astilbe, baby’s breath, calendula, celosia, chrysanthemum, coneflower seed heads, dahlia, daisies, gomphrena, herbs, hydrangea, lavender, lunaria, marigold, poppy seed pods, rose buds, salvia, sea holly, statice, strawflower, yarrow and zinnia.Flowers with high water content, like peonies, are harder and take longer to dry. They can also lose their shape and color during the process. Delicate flowers, like carnations, are beautiful when dried, but their fragility makes them difficult to work with.; , Fresh flowers for bouquets are usually harvested with new buds in early bloom. If you want to dry fresh cut flowers that are already in a bouquet, wait until the blooms have opened almost completely. If you’re harvesting flowers yourself specifically for drying, wait until the buds have opened about 90% – you want them to be just shy of full bloom when you cut them.Avoid harvesting flowers that are mature or past their prime – they will often lose their petals and shed pollen during the drying process. Make sure the flowers haven’t set seeds yet.  Flowers are at peak quality for harvesting on dry, sunny mornings after the early morning dew has evaporated. Get the flowers out of the sunlight immediately after you harvest them. This helps them retain their vibrant color.Do not use water to rinse dirt off the petals. Hold them upside down and shake them gently to remove any dirt.Dewy flowers take much longer to dry and the moisture may cause mold to develop between the petals. Avoid harvesting at midday, when the temperature peaks. The heat can cause the flowers to wilt, making them less ideal candidates for drying., These work best when building dried flower bouquets. Cut the stems no shorter than six inches in length. This will facilitate the bundling and drying process later. Place the flowers upright in a bucket or basket while you’re harvesting them.This inflicts the least amount of damage to their fragile petals and is the easiest way to transport them from the field.If you plan to use tall vases for your dried bouquets, keep the final look in mind while harvesting. If you don’t know how you’ll be displaying the flowers, leave as much length as possible on the stems. You can trim them to your desired length later.  

select hardy flowers with low moisture content.  choose flowers that are almost at full bloom.  harvest flowers and herbs in the morning.  opt for flowers that have long, straight stems. 

 Your physician can prescribe preventive medication to reduce the number and severity of your migraines. There are several different preventative medications that your physician may suggest. Preventive medications are meant to be taken daily and can include:Beta blockers, which are also used to treat heart disease. Although the reason they work is not clear, doctors believe it may be that they keep blood vessels from constricting and dilating in the brain. Beta blockers include atenolol (Tenormin), metoprolol (Lopressor), propranolol (Inderal). Calcium channel blockers are another type of heart medication that have been found to reduce the number and duration of migraine headaches. These medications include verapamil (Calan) or diltiazem (Cardizem). Tricyclic antidepressants help prevent other kinds of headaches as well as migraines. Medications include amitriptyline(Elavil), nortriptyline (Pamelor), doxepin (Sinequan), imipramine (Tofranil). Some anticonvulsant medications will also prevent migraine headaches, although physicians are not sure why. Some anticonvulsants that have been effective include divalproex sodium (Depakote), gabapentin (Neurontin), topiramate (Topamax). Botox injections have been approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) to treat migraines. The medication helps some people and is injected in a series in the forehead, temples, back of the neck and shoulders about every three months.  Acute or abortive medications are designed to stop the headache you currently have. Acute or abortive medications are given when the symptoms first appear. Different medications are used to treat either the pain or the associated symptoms.Triptans are some of the first medications prescribed to relieve pain, nausea, and sensitivity to light, sounds, and smells. Triptan medications include: almotriptan (Axert), eletriptan (Relpax), frovatriptan (Frova), naratriptan (Amerge), rizatriptan (Maxalt), sumatriptan (Imitrex), zolmitriptan (Zomig). Ergots work by constricting the blood vessels but have more side effects than triptans. These are the second type of medications used to help relieve pain and the associated symptoms, which can be worse than the headache itself. These medications include dihydroergotamine (Migranal) and ergotamine (Ergomar). Isometheptene, dichloralphenazone, and acetaminophen, known as Midrin, combines a pain reliever, sedative, and medication that also constricts blood vessels to address the needs of someone with a headache. Narcotics, such as codeine, are used for people who can’t take triptans or ergots because of side effects, allergic reactions, or interactions with other medications. But keep in mind that narcotics may also cause dependency and rebound headaches.  Consider using feverfew daily to prevent migraines or reduce the severity of migraine headaches. This is not proven to reduce the severity or the number of headaches from which you suffer. However, there is anecdotal evidence that suggests some effect, so it is worth considering.

 Transfer paper prints are usually translucent, so the shirt's color will show through. For best results, use a white shirt. If you must have a colored shirt, be aware that the image may not be as bright. You can also use transfer paper meant for dark shirts, but it will have a white background. You will have to trim around the image, or the white will show up.Baggy t-shirts were very popular in the 80s.If you want something more modern that is simply vintage inspired, you can use a fitted shirt instead. If you want something that looks vintage, consider using an old shirt. The more faded, the better.  Logos from 1980s cartoons work the best. Look for something that is larger than your hand, and has the title of the show as well as some of the characters. Make sure that you get the right generation, however; many of the original cartoons got reboots. For example, the new My Little Ponies look very different from the original ones. This will defeat the whole vintage look.  Some of the most popular ones were: Thundercats, Mighty Mouse, and Rainbow Brite.Care Bears, My Little Pony, and Popples were also popular. You can also use other popular films and shows, such as: Back to the Future, Dark Crystal, Ghostbusters, Labyrinth, Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, etc. You can also use logos from bands and other things that were popular in the 80s, such as MTV or the Cabbage Patch dolls.  Copy the image from your web browser, then paste into an image editing program. Use the mirror or flip option to reverse the image. If your image has words on it, they will be backwards.  If the image is too big, you can shrink it. If the image is too small, you can try to enlarge it, but be aware that you may loose some quality. If you are using dark transfer paper, you typically don't have to reverse the image., Craft stores and fabric stores sell many different types of transfer paper, so make sure that you get the right kind for your shirt. If you have a white shirt, you can use any type of transfer paper. If you have a colored shirt, you will need to get one designed for colored shirts.  Remember to print on the coated side of the transfer paper.Some transfer papers are made specifically for certain types of printers, so double-check before buying it. It needs to match your printer.  Some types of transfer paper, like the kind used for dark shirts, have a white background. If you don't trim this background off, it will show up on the finished product. Use a small pair of scissors to carefully trim around the image., Make sure that the image is centered. The top of the image should reach just past the armhole. If you are using dark transfer paper, you will typically have to place it image-side-up; double-check the instructions., Different types of image transfer papers have different requirements, so read the directions carefully., The image should be transferred onto the shirt. Don't worry if it doesn't look perfect. This will help give it a vintage feel. 

choose a blank, solid-colored t-shirt.  choose a vintage image to print.  reverse the image using an image editing program.  print the image using transfer paper.  trim off the excess paper, if needed.  place the paper image-side-down against your t-shirt.  iron the image using the directions on the package.  peel the paper off. 

 Even if you want to completely shut out someone from your life, it’s important to always be polite. This can leave the door open if you want to rekindle your relationship with the person in the future. It can also keep the situation getting worse and involving other people.Extend civility in any situation, especially when others are around. You don’t want to leave a bad impression of yourself because of your personal issues. For example, if a person whom you want to shut out asks how you are, say, “I’m fine, thank you” in a neutral tone. This brief answer lets the person know you don’t want any further contact without ignoring the person or saying something impolite.; , You may be in a situation, such as work or school, which requires you to see the individual or group regularly. Finding ways to avoid potential contact can help you more effectively shut out a person or people.Take note of people’s schedules. This can help you avoid any type of contact with them, including small talk or arguments. For example, if you know a person you want to shut out goes for happy hour at the same place every week, choose a new location to meet with your friends and colleagues. Recognize that it may take a while for people to get the message that you’re avoiding them at all costs.  If you have to interact with someone and can’t avoid it, limit your exposure as much as possible. Respond to questions, messages, phone calls, or other types of contact only when necessary. This sets boundaries and can decrease any stress you may feel. It also helps send the message you don’t want contact with the person.Keep responses as brief and polite as possible. For example, if someone emails you a long note, you can choose to acknowledge it or not. Keep your response to the bare minimum necessary. You can write, “Thank you for the information, John. I’ll have a look at it and get back to you.” Keep your comments to people brief and polite as well. A simple statement such as, “Thank you for your help, I appreciate it,” followed by you returning to what you were doing sends a clear signal that you don’t want any contact. When you engage with someone, leave no room for further conversation. For example, you can say, "Thank you for your assistance. Have a nice day."  , You may be trying to shut out one specific person. You may have mutual friends, family members, or colleagues with this person. If this is the case, you may need to establish boundaries or distance with these people as well. This can help you more effectively shut out the desired person.Recognize that distancing yourself from people to cut out an individual or group may result in you being cut out of relationships. You can politely decline invitations from people you like by saying something like, “Thanks for the offer Caroline, but I’ve already got plans this evening. Please give everyone my best.” See people on an individual basis to avoid potentially uncomfortably situations. Say, “I’d love to go out, Caroline, but I’m struggling in groups. Can we get together for dinner next week? Maybe just the two of us?” Meet acquaintances one-on-one so that you can maintain a relationship without including the person you want to shut out. Take creating distance as an opportunity to try new activities and meet new people if you want.  Despite your best efforts, you may not get the message across that you want no contact. Letting the person or group know your wishes in a polite manner can shut them out of your life entirely.Remain as kind and honest as possible, but don't make excuses. Be direct. For example, say, “I don't feel as though we have much in common any more. I would feel better ending our friendship. I wish you nothing but the best.” With colleagues, you can say, “Alan, I think it’s best we speak only when absolutely necessary. I wish you the best.”Tell the individual or group in person if possible. Send a polite, handwritten note or email if this is easier for you. Doing so can give you confidence about your decision while showing respect to the other parties.Focus your comments on yourself. Say, “I really need to concentrate on myself right now. I think that it’s the best for us to not have any contact.” This not only shuts the person out of your life, but can keep the individual from feeling badly.  

remain polite at all times.  remove yourself from potential contact.  limit your contact.  create distance among acquaintances.  inform the person(s) of your wishes. 

 Feeling beautiful extends past just what you wear or how you look. You can also participate in activities that can make you feel like a beautiful person inside and out. Refocus your attention on helping those in need by donating your time. You will be able to reap the benefits of helping others and it may help you gain perspective on how you are feeling about yourself.   You could even combine the two and volunteer for something like the Look Good Feel Better program through the American Cancer Society that helps patients learn beauty techniques in order to feel better about themselves during their cancer treatment., Dancing is a great way to get moving and get working on feeling comfortable in your own body. Studies have shown that dancing can make you feel beautiful as well as be fundamental to your sense of well-being.It is a great form of exercise and self-expression that can help you feel more confident.Dancing will help you:   Realize what your beautiful body is capable of. Practice graceful and fluid movements. Get an endorphin rush from the exercise. Straighten your posture and confidently hold your head up high.  What could make you feel more beautiful then spending time with people who think you are amazing? You may have friends who are struggling with the same thoughts, and talking about it may even bring you closer together. Nothing is more beautiful than friends lifting each other up when they are down, so let your friends help you rediscover the beautiful qualities you possess.  

donate your time.  dance.  spend time with your friends. 

 Make sure the picture of George is on the inside.       ; , Fold both of the sides into the middle crease from the first fold. , At the same end, fold the corners into the middle line that is made by the two folds. This will be the collar. The exact angles are not critical.  This fold can cross the circular pattern to form a "necklace"; see the front of the shirt in the next step. You can also adjust this fold to control the length of the finished shirt.  You can get the best fit by tucking the end snugly under the collar and then sliding your finger to the bottom to form the crease.           Unfold both of the folds you just made. Then slightly unfold the two middle folds for the “sleeves.” Take one side at the bottom of the dollar where you just made the fold in step 5. Pinch out a corner shape (reverse the crease made in step 5 on the outer edge). Fold the side back into place with the “sleeve” sticking out. Make the other sleeve the same way. 

fold the dollar bill in half like a hot dog bun.  unfold the dollar.  turn the dollar bill over and fold down the white part at the side near the edge.  ,  turn it again.  fold the opposite end in as shown.  fold the same end that you just folded again, up the rest of the way so the bottom fits neatly under the “collar.” the collar holds this fold in place.  make the sleeves.  fold both of the upwards folds back under the collar, and now you have a collared shirt made of a one dollar bill!  

 This is often a misconception in building positive credit. Major utility companies and phone companies only report to credit agencies when payments are not made.; , Pay each credit card bill in full as soon as you receive it, so you do not establish yourself as a 'late' payer. It may be necessary to obtain a "Secured" credit card if your credit scores are already low or non-existent. Do your homework and research as some secured credit card companies check credit before approval and will actually decline you.   Set up automatic payments with your credit card company and/or bank. Most credit cards will allow you to set up automatic withdrawals from your checking account every month to pay for your credit card. This way, you won't risk forgetting about your payments and registering as a late payer, dropping your credit score. Automatic payments usually let you specify whether you want to: Register to pay the monthly minimum. Credit cards will force you to pay a small amount every month or risk a penalty. Register to pay the balance on the credit card. The balance on the credit card, or how much you owe, will usually vary from month to month. Make sure that you avoid an overdraft when doing this. Register to pay a set amount every month. This set amount can be somewhere in between the monthly minimum and the balance payments.   Realize that this method might not work for everyone; if it doesn't, follow another way of establishing credit.  This is also called a secured credit card. This is a program which many major banks will have, where you pay a deposit on a credit card (usually equal to the limit) in order to get a card even when you have less than perfect credit. Using this starter card, you can build credit.Just make sure that the card is reported to the major credit reporting companies.  Many places asking for your credit score will also look at other information, like if you can keep down a job. If they see you're changing jobs every few months, then your credit score won't really be enough to help you: you'll look too risky. Keep down one job for a few years at a time to appear more stable. This will help you with things like getting a mortgage.   If you appear reliable, they may be willing to forgive a slightly less than ideal credit score.  Much like the above, many places will look at your housing history. If you move too much, you're a risk. However, if you stay in one apartment or house, you seem much more reliable.  Choose one that offers the lowest interest rate and if possible one that offers a cash back percentage on purchases you make. Try not to start a new credit card until you have at least okay credit, because each application counts against your score, as does being denied.   Apply for a major credit card, such as Visa, American Express, Discover, or Mastercard. These will help you move into the 700-score territory faster. If you can't get a major credit card, think about getting a "secured" credit card, which works after you deposit money with an issuing bank. (Essentially, a debit card.)  , Lenders see bank accounts as signs of financial stability and consistent savings behavior. Given this, evidence of continuous use of checking and savings accounts increases your chances that a bank will offer you a credit card.   You shouldn't, however, just open accounts left and right, as this makes you look bad rather than good. Just have more than one and make sure that there's money in each of them. Alternatively, contact your bank or credit union, open a charge account with them, and deposit a specific amount of money 'into' the account. This is called a pre-paid charge account.  It will look better if the bill you are paying at the end of the month is a low one. Keep your outstanding debt as low as possible in order to improve your score even further.  If you've done a good job of building an okay score and then find that you're very slightly late on a single payment, you may be able to get that late payment taken off your record by asking very nicely. If you have a good history with the entity you were late in paying, they may be willing to take it off if you ask.  Having good credit over a long period of time will go a long way towards convincing lenders that you're a solid bet. Don't rush the process.  Budget out how much money you have coming in, how much money you'd like to save, and what sorts of things you need to pay for on a monthly basis.   Having a budget is great even if you're not interested in fixing your credit. A budget will allow you to save more money, be prudent about what financial decisions you make, and — of course — fix your credit. Budget out how much you can afford to spend rather than how much you'd like to spend. There's a difference. If you set aside $200 every month for discretionary purchases, a $600 flat-screen TV will have to wait three months before you can pull the trigger. Don't pull the trigger right away and be $400 in debt for two months.  What's the good of having a budget if you don't really stick to it? If you say you're going to spend $120 on groceries every week, don't go over $120. It's simple to say and hard to do. But it's essential for a good credit score.  Make sure that you do not charge more than you can actually afford to pay at the end of the month. Some illustrative examples:    Do use your credit card to pay for gas. If your income is $2,000 per month, and your gas expenses come out to $140 per month, you should be able to afford to pay off $140 on your credit card every month.  Don't use your credit card to pay for a $1,500 mattress. If your monthly income is $2,000, putting a $1,500 purchase on it right away is a bad, bad idea. You'll be paying it off for several months and could miss a payment.  You should be able to make more than the minimum payment on the card, slowly working towards being able to pay it off entirely. If you can't afford to make more than the minimum payment, you aren't being financially responsible and have taken on too much debt.  Approaching 70-75% of your credit limit or maxing out your cards frequently will look dangerous and irresponsible to lenders because it often is.Credit cards are a safety net, so leave a little extra room. Just like you wouldn't want an actual safety net the exact same size as your body, you don't want zero room for movement on your credit cards.  If you don't know what your credit looks like, it'll be hard to fix it. You can get one free annual credit report through the government-run AnnualCreditReport.com. For your credit score, you will have to pay a nominal fee; they are not offered for free. When checking your report, make sure you:   Dispute any additional accounts that aren't yours or that you didn't open. Dispute any reports of late payments that were in fact paid on-time. Dispute any bankruptcies older than 10 years that are still listed as due even though you settled them in bankruptcy. Dispute any negative information older than 7 years.  Your FICO credit score will improve if you avoid one big balance on a single card and instead have several small balances on different cards.   This is because the FICO formula looks at the difference between your balances (how much you owe) and your limits (how much you can charge per month). A low balance-to-limit ratio makes for better credit score than a high balance-to-limit ratio. Even if you pay your balance, a high balance-to-limit ratio is not ideal. If you spend $4,000 on a $5,000 limit, you've got a .8 ratio, which is pretty high. Shoot to get a .1 ratio, which means that you're spending 10% of your available limit.  Don't let your credit cards sit there unloved. If you don't use your credit card at all, your credit score will go down. The credit score formula prefers to see a card that is getting regular use over a credit card that is lying fallow.  You want your information reported to the major credit reporting companies, if possible. These are the ones lenders are most likely to check, so if you only have one credit card and it reports only to a small company, you're in trouble. This is where having more than one credit card or bank account, etc, can come in handy.  

having your bills in your name will not impact your credit.  always pay bills on time.  get a credit card reference.  keep a job.  stay in one place.  apply for a credit card.  open checking and savings accounts.  keep debt low.  ask for help.  give it time.  check your budget.  stick to your budget.  use a credit card instead of cash to make small purchase you can afford.  make more than the minimum payment.  stay well below your credit limit.  check your credit report annually.  spread your debt out on several different cards, if possible.  don't let your credit cards go unused.  make sure your credit is attached to the major companies. 

 National chains like Home Depot or Lowes will definitely sell furniture sliders. If you are planning to move your furniture over carpet or grass you should buy sliders that specialize in that movement.   If you don’t have any sliders you can also try using Frisbees.; , Lift each corner and put a slider underneath so that the smooth edge is towards the floor. This will reduce the friction and make moving much easier.  Once you have the sliders under the corners of the furniture you can begin to push it. Having another person would be helpful to insure that the furniture does not tip. Push the furniture from a lower section rather than the top to minimize the risk of tipping. The friction is almost eliminated with sliders and the furniture should move very easily.  

invest in furniture sliders.you can buy the sliders of appropriate size at your local hardware or home goods store.  place your sliders under the corners of the furniture.  push the furniture. 

 To reduce calorie density, you always want to add more water-rich ingredients to your dishes.  Change a pasta dish by substituting whole-wheat pasta, or substitute a whole-wheat tortilla for a white flour tortilla.  You can substitute saturated fats like butter with olive or canola oil. You can also used reduced amounts of fats or use cooking spray for browning.  For instance, substitute reduced-fat cheese or cream cheese in a casserole.  Prepare the recipe using a sugar substitute or cut the amount of sugar.  Many recipes include a listing of how the ingredients were modified to adjust the CD. Experiment with these principles in your own cooking.  

add more vegetables and fruit.  switch to whole grains.  decide how to lower fat.  substitute low-fat versions of ingredients when possible.  try to reduce sugar.  read the recipe supplements.

 You should not include any figure that you don’t mention in the text.Always refer to the figure by its number, not wording such as “the figure above” or “the figure below.”   For example, you could write: “As seen in Figure 1, tomato consumption has risen sharply in the past three decades.”, Label the graph or chart “Figure X.” Italicize this part.Figures should be numbered in the order they appear; your first graph or other illustration is Figure 1, the second is Figure 2, etc. If the graph has an existing title, give it in “sentence case.” This means you only capitalize the first letter of the first word in the sentence, as well as the first letter after a colon.  This description, or legend, provides your reader with information regarding the graph's content. Make sure you give enough information that the caption describes the figure adequately. In APA, this description ends with a period.   For example: Figure 1. Rise in tomato consumption,1970-2000. Use sentence case for the description too.  In most cases, you will begin this information with the words "Reprinted from..."This will signal to your reader that the graph is not original to your work, but rather comes from a different source.   If the graph you’re presenting is your original work, meaning you collected all the data and compiled it yourself, you don’t need this phrase. For example: Figure 1. Rise in tomato consumption,1970-2000. Reprinted from.  Place book titles in italics, and cite the relevant page number in parentheses immediately following the title with no punctuation in between. Use title case for books and journal titles, meaning you capitalize all the major words in the title.For example: Figure 1. Rise in tomato consumption,1970-2000. Reprinted from Growing Vegetables in Your Backyard (p. 43),  , This information should follow the format of "by first initial(s) last name, date, location: publisher." For example, "J. Green, 2002, Hot Springs: Lake Publishers."   For example: Figure 1. Rise in tomato consumption,1970-2000. Reprinted from Growing Vegetables in Your Backyard (p. 43), by J. Green, 2002, Hot Springs: Lake Publishers.  For example, if rights to the graph in question are held by the American Tomato Growers' Association, you'll need to contact this organization for permission to use the graph. Then, state in your caption that the graph is "Copyright 2002 by the American Tomato Growers' Association. Reprinted with permission." Your complete citation, then, will read:    Figure 1. Rise in tomato consumption, 1970-2000. Reprinted from Growing Vegetables in Your Backyard (p. 43), by J. Green, 2002, Hot Springs: Lake Publishers.

refer to the figure in your text.  place the citation underneath the graph.  provide a brief description of the graph.  begin your citation information.  list the volume's name, then the page number in parentheses.  follow with author, date of publication, location, and publisher.  end with copyright information for the graph if you plan to publish the paper. 

 Finding out what your face and body shapes are will help you to match these to the ideal dress, one that flatters and accentuates all of your good features, hiding anything you might consider a flaw. The steps in this section will help you to match your face and body shapes to your dress style.  This means that you can choose any type of neckline you like.   If you have a round face (as wide as it is long, a little narrower at the forehead and jawline), you should look for a prom dress that elongates your face to make her look more oval. V-necks, Queen Anne and Empire necklines, sweetheart and scoop necks suit best your oval face. Always avoid high neck dresses and supersized necklaces, as they tend to hide the neck and therefore make your face look even more round. If you have a triangle face (wide jaw line, narrow forehead), look for necklines with a stronger vertical shape that can add curves to your face: Sabrina necklines, scoop necks, sweetheart necklines and cowl necks. If you have a heart shaped face (sharp and oval chin, slightly prominent cheekbones, wide forehead), you need to make your face look wider, so opt for necklines that draw a horizontal line near the neck: high or wide necklines. If you have a square face (square jaw line, forehead, cheekbones and jaw having the same width), the perfect prom dress for you should have a vertical shape, so look for scoop necks, Sabrina, sweetheart, cowl neck styles, and always avoid square necklines. If you have an oblong face (prominent chin, forehead, cheekbones and jawline having the same width), look for prom dresses with necklines that can make your face look wider and more oval: round, wide, Sabrina and cowl necks. Also, stay away from V-neckline dresses.  You could be an apple, pear, hourglass, vase. There are various different categories for body shape and you can find your body shape by reading: How to determine your body shape. To match the body shape and dress, here are some suggestions:   If you have an hourglass body shape (well-defined waist, torso and hips having about the same width), look for prom dresses that accentuate the waist and keep a perfect balance between tops and bottoms: if they have sleeves, a full skirt is required; if the top of the dress is tight, the skirt must also tightly follow the hips and thighs. If you have a rectangle body shape (no defined waistline, shoulders, bust and hips having the same width), you need to define your waist and add volume on both your upper and lower body. The best prom dresses for you are draped dresses with a defined waist and full skirt, Empire dresses, A-lines and any dress with a full skirt, ruffles and folds. If you have an inverted triangle body shape (little waist definition, shoulders and bust larger than the hips), you must add volume to your lower body in order to draw attention away from your broad shoulders. You can create the hourglass silhouette illusion by wearing Empire line dresses, A-lines with deep V-necks, wrap dresses with a higher waist and other dresses with full skirts and details or embellishment on the hips. If you have a pear body shape (torso and upper body smaller than the hips), you must make your silhouette look like the ideal hourglass figure, so look for prom dresses that draw attention to your shoulders and bust and reduce your lower body: A-line dresses, wrap and draped bust dresses, as well as prom dresses with well-defined waist and embellishments that draw attention to your upper body. If you have an apple body shape (little or no waist definition, upper body wider than the hips), you need dresses that can create the illusion of a slimmer waist while keeping the right balance between the upper and lower body: Empire and A-line dresses with simple tops and a low and wide neckline (scoop, square, sweetheart).  

focus on matching the dress to your face and body shapes, to ensure the ideal look and fit, therefore making your job of finding a dress easier.  consider your face shape in order to choose the perfect neckline if you have an oval face, then you are blessed with what it is considered to be the ideal face shape - forehead wider than the chin, cheekbones slightly prominent and face delicately narrowing towards the chin, which is narrow and oval.  know your body shape and how to match it to the perfect cut. 

 Adopting a dog is a serious responsibility. If you’ve never owned a dog before, you might not have much of an idea of what you’re in for. Foster owners are looking to place their dogs with someone who has a history of caring for dogs. This communicates to the foster owner that you know, in part, what you’re in for.While it’s not a guarantee that you will be able to adopt a fostered dog, prior dog ownership enhances your credibility as a bona fide dog owner and animal lover. If you haven’t owned a dog before, you might want to buy a dog first, then adopt a fostered dog after you have some firsthand experience training, housebreaking, and living with a dog.  If you live in a housing situation in which dogs are not allowed, you will not be allowed to adopt a dog. This ensures that dogs are not improperly adopted and set out on the street when, for instance, an individual’s landlord finds out that they have a dog. Other situations in which adopting a fostered dog is inadvisable include:having a family member with a dog fur allergy having family members who do not want dogs in the house being too busy to care for the dog  , If you want to meet your potential fostered dog before filling out any paperwork, you can do so at an adoption event. Adoption events are small festivals where adoptable pets – including dogs – get to meet potential owners. Fostered pets are often available through local adoption event.For instance, PetSmart offers four National Adoption Weekend events in the US and Canada. The events are in February, May, September, and November.You can find an adoption event near you using the Petfinder Event Calendar, available online at https://www.petfinder.com/calendar. Once you decide you want to adopt a fostered dog you located at an adoption event, you’ll need to fill out the necessary paperwork. There will be an interim period while your paperwork is being processed before the dog is actually placed with you.  If you want to adopt a fostered dog, you’ll need to complete an extensive questionnaire. This paperwork helps the humane society, animal shelter, or similar agency determine whether you’re qualified to adopt a fostered dog. Questions you might see on the adoption paperwork include:Why do you want to adopt a dog? Are you looking for a puppy or an older dog? Do you plan on moving soon?  , When you adopt a fostered dog, you’ll have to meet them and their foster family. This will give the foster family a chance to learn more about your character and temperament in order to determine if you’re a good fit for their fostered dog. It will also give you a chance to see if the fostered dog’s temperament and personality are a good match for you.Ask the foster family questions about the fostered dog’s habits and behavior when meeting them. For instance, you might ask if the dog is housetrained, if it chews furniture and books, and if it knows any tricks. Schedule a meeting with the foster family and fostered dog you’re interested in as soon as possible. Otherwise, other families might adopt the fostered dog before you. You might be able to reach the foster family by email or phone.  When you show up to your meet-and-greet, bring a dog collar and leash with you. Since you’ve already been approved by the adoption agency, you should be able to head home to your fostered dog that very day.You’ll have to fill out some paperwork before taking your dog home if you attended an adoption event. You likely won’t be able to take the dog home until your paperwork is processed, even if you’re ahead of anyone else on the adoption list.  Once you’ve decided to take the dog home, you’ll have a fill out a few more documents. These are much briefer and more limited in scope than the application you initially completed in order to adopt the dog. The documents basically constitute a contract that makes you legally responsible for the health of the fostered dog from that point on.Along with the final adoption paperwork, you’ll need to pay an adoption fee.The adoption fee for a particular organization will vary. Ask a knowledgeable representative of the organization what the adoption fee for your dog will be.  

have prior experience as a dog owner.  be able to own a dog.  attend adoption events.  complete the paperwork.  meet the fostered dog you want to adopt.  be ready to take the dog home with you.  complete adoption paperwork. 

 If you know one of your relatives will go on a long rant about another's weight, choice of partner, or parenting decisions, speak to them ahead of time and ask them in a polite, but firm way to refrain from staging an "intervention" over a dinner you are working hard to prepare. If necessary, let them know that you will not go to all this trouble so that they can pick on someone they only see once a year.  If you know for a fact that there is no talking to a certain guest, organize after-dinner entertainment that will split up your group for a little while so that everyone can take a deep breath. For example, offer a walk to a few of your guests who get along with each other, while suggesting watching family videos or playing games at your house to others.  While many people expect everyone to "get along for once", chances are, it will not go smoothly. Don't plaster a frozen smile on your face and ignore family members who are actively ruining the experience for others. Take them aside (maybe in the kitchen, maybe while getting groceries out of the car or beverages from the porch) and ask them to change their behaviour. If they blame it on someone else, reassure them that you will talk to that person, as well.  

try to set boundaries ahead of time.  split them up.  accept that there is no such thing as a "perfect" reunion. 

 If you've been through the race before and failed, try to map the course out in your head. This way, you'll be semi-prepared for anything coming your way.; , This will help you build up speed when you come out of the gate.  This will avoid any unwanted mishaps later on that may cost you a victory.  One foul move could cost you the race. It's important to remember to keep a good speed the whole way through the race, only pushing the limits when it's truly needed.  Cars, animals, buildings, riders, and other foreign objects can all cause you to bail or wreck, letting several riders pass you in a very short amount of time.  If you bail, you may want to consider restarting.  

begin the death race.  start pushing in the regular footed stance before the race starts.  separate yourself from the other riders if possible.  keep control throughout the race.  avoid obstacles and other riders.  do not bail!

 As with most objects, you will not get back nearly as much as you originally paid for most diamonds. The value of diamonds is based on an artificial scarcity, meaning that diamonds are neither genuinely rare nor intrinsically valuable.Most jewelers have no issue acquiring quality diamonds well below retail value, and thus will likely offer between thirty and seventy percent of the retail value, depending upon the diamond quality.Selling directly to a customer shopping for a ring might enable you to get more than a jeweler or diamond dealer would offer, but you are still unlikely to get the full value of the ring. Set a reasonable expectation at around sixty percent of the ring’s retail value, and have that offer ready to present to jewelers.; , Before you set out to sell your diamond ring, you should know exactly what you have. Have the ring appraised by a certified appraiser, ideally one who does not directly buy diamonds, so that you can get a better picture of the quality and value of your piece.Appraisal can also help you establish credibility for your ring. A ring that you thought was diamond may turn out to be a different stone, or the setting may be a different metal than you originally thought. An appraiser can let you know for sure, and provide you with documentation. An appraiser can also help you establish the retail value of your ring, which you can use to adjust your resale value, remembering that you are unlikely to get full appraisal value when selling.If you think your diamond is likely not very valuable, spending money on an appraisal may not be necessary. If you paid less than $1,000 to $2,000 for the ring, a diamond dealer may be able to give you a reasonable value estimation for free.  When you sell your diamonds, you have two general options. The first is to sell to a reseller such as a jewelry store, diamond dealer, or pawn shop, that will turn around and sell the ring again. The second option is to try to sell the ring directly to a customer online or through your personal network.Selling to a dealer or jeweler is often more immediate, as finding a buyer can take time. If you are looking to get your money quickly, or if you simply want to be rid of the piece, selling to a diamond buyer may be your best option.If you are not in a rush to get rid of your ring, selling directly to a buyer, either through an online marketplace or through your network of personal contacts, can sometimes allow you to get more money than you may have received working with a diamond buyer.You may also be able to sell to an online auction site that takes a commission from the sale, but allows you to sell directly to a customer, potentially still getting more than you could get from a jeweler.  

set reasonable expectations.  get the ring appraised.  research your selling options. 

 This is optional but it will help to bring forth the flavor.To toast the teff heat it in a hot, dry pan for about 2 minutes.  Add the cup of teff seeds and 3 cups of water to a saucepan., Heat the teff and water on a high flame until water starts to boil., Turn down the heat and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. Stir frequently to avoid having the teff stick to the bottom of the pan., Allow to stand for an additional 5 minutes., Teff has a lightly nutty flavor and can be enjoyed in savory or sweet preparations.  For a savory dish, try serving teff as an accompaniment to steamed greens or with a stew instead of rice.In savory dishes, teff is often seasoned with ginger, garlic, cardamom, chilies, basil or cilantro.For a sweater dish to be eaten at breakfast, try serving teff like oatmeal or other hot breakfast cereals. Add honey and dried fruits like raisins. 

consider toasting the teff first.  combine the teff and water.  heat the pan.  reduce the heat.  remove from heat when the teff is soft and the water has been absorbed.  serve the teff. 

 The can should have a mouth approximately five to six inches across and a height of about seven to eight inches. The coffee can should have smooth sides which cannot be easily scaled by rodents. If using economy size coffee cans which are ten inches deep or more, place a small pad or bunched cloth at the bottom to prevent injury to the mouse you’ll catch.   You can use plastic or metal coffee cans. If using metal, though, ensure they aren’t ribbed with concentric rings which the mouse might use like a ladder to escape.  Hold the paper in place using a rubber band wrapped around the rim of the can. Take an extendable blade and cut an “X” in the top of the construction paper, stopping about one inch from the edge of the can at each of the four lines.Tissue paper might also work in place of construction paper. It is important to maintain the appearance that the papered-over coffee can is capable of supporting the mouse when it walks across it. Instead of cutting a solid “X”, you could try poking small, closely-spaced holes in an “X” shape across the surface of the paper.  Lay a long ruler or paint stirring stick from the floor to the mouth of the coffee can. If necessary, affix the ruler or stick to the can with tape.Mice come in different sizes. If you find that your mice are unable to scamper up the thin ruler, consider placing two next to each other and taping them together to ensure easy access to the trap.  Place the food -- cheese, a piece of candy, or bread -- along the edge of the coffee can directly opposite the point at which the ruler, paint stirring stick, or other ramp-like object you’ve affixed to the coffee can meets the can’s mouth.Do not select a bait food which is too heavy or gives lie to the illusion that the papered-over surface of the coffee can is stable. Do not place the coffee can near a countertop or step stool from which the bait could be eaten from the far side of the ramp without passing over the construction paper.  The mouse will run up the ruler to reach the food on the opposite side of the coffee can, then fall into the can when the apparently solid surface gives way beneath it. You’ll know the trap has been sprung if you see the bait you laid is no longer there, or if the construction paper has been partially torn. Check the can for the mouse.   Remove the ruler or makeshift ramp from the can and take the can to a location about five to ten miles from human habitation.Place the can on the ground and turn it sideways, allowing the mouse to exit.  

obtain a large coffee can.  wrap a piece of construction paper over the top of the can.  place the can on the floor in an area where the mouse resides.  place a piece of food on the construction paper.  wait for the mouse to fall in. 

 Almond milk can be substituted for cow's milk in any recipe. Use the same measurement of almond milk as regular milk in the recipe. You can bake with it, add it to soups and make sauces from it; almond milk can do almost everything that regular milk can do.

 Before you read, read all titles, chapter and section headings, subheadings, and any charts, graphs, diagrams, questions, and summaries you can find.If you are reading a text without these things, you might consider reading the first and last sentence of every paragraph or chapter to get an idea of the material the text is covering.  Write down any questions you hope your reading will answer. You will comprehend more if you go into the text knowing what you want to learn. If you are not sure what you want to learn, go through and turn every chapter heading, section title, etc. into a question. Try to guess what the text will teach you: ask yourself the question you think the text might answer.If you like, add further questions while you read.  Review your questions, then read the text. You may skim or scan, or you may just read at your current fastest pace.Depending on the length of the text, you may choose to read it all, or you may choose to read it in sections. For maximum comprehension, pause at the end of every section and think about what you have read. Answer the question if you can. For maximum speed, answer the questions once you have read the entire text.  Now that you've read, you should be able to answer the questions you asked yourself. Answer all the questions you have read. You do not have to write them down (unless that is your assignment), just recite them aloud.If you are pausing after each section, make sure you can recite the answer to that section before you move on to the next. If you cannot, go back and skim it again. If you feel you made an error in the framing of one of your questions, reframe it so that you can answer it.  The final "R" in SQR3 is "review," which will help you retain the information you have comprehended. Go back over the questions you have answered and see if you can still answer them from memory.If you cannot, skim the section again until you can.  

survey the text.  write questions.  read or skim the text.  recite the answers.  review the text.
