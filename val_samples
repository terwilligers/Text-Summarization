 As soon as you receive a statement from your doctor or an Explanation of Benefits from your insurer, read them carefully to make sure all the entries and amounts are correct.Your Explanation of Benefits includes a list of services or supplies that your healthcare provider told your heath insurance company were given to you. If you get a bill or statement from your doctor as well, you should compare the two documents and make sure everything is in order and they both say the same thing.For example, if your EOB states that you received 10 X-rays, but your statement from your doctor says you only received one, this may be evidence of health insurance fraud – but it also may be that an assistant simply typed a zero by accident while he was inputting the information. If you keep a personal log of your doctor visits and what happened at each visit, you also have this to compare against your EOB.; , If you don't understand something, such as an abbreviation, ask your doctor what it means.   Especially if you were unconscious during treatment, there may be entries on your statement that you don't remember. If you have any doubts about whether you actually received a treatment, ask to see your medical records and compare the record to your bill., Certain types of billing entries may seem legitimate but actually are cause for concern.   For example, the insurance company may have been billed for each stage of a procedure as though each stage were a separate procedure, rather than being billed a single charge for the procedure as a whole – a practice known as "unbundling" which may be fraudulent.Another type of billing fraud is referred to as "upcoding." This is when the medical professional bills the insurance company for a more costly procedure than what was actually performed., If you find any differences between your insurer's statement and your medical bill or medical record, let your insurance company know as soon as possible.   Often the problem is simply a clerical error that can be easily fixed as long as the insurance company knows about it. However, if you suspect fraud, let your insurance company know and explain the reasons for your suspicions.  Your insurance company may have a complaint form available online, or you can call and request an official form.   You may be able to remain anonymous, but you must include the names of the person or company suspected of fraud, as well as information about the insured., If you don't want to fill out an official complaint form or if you don't have enough of the required information to do so, find out if the company has an email where you can submit a tip.   For example, if you want to report fraud involving a Blue Cross and Blue Shield company, you can email the BCBS National Anti-Fraud Department at stopfraud@bcbsa.com. You might use an email instead of a complaint form in situations where you weren't entirely sure about who in a company was committing the acts, or if you had more general suspicions.  If you wish to remain anonymous, you can call the company's insurance fraud hotline to report your suspicions.   For example, if you want to report possible fraud to Blue Cross and Blue Shield, you can call the company's hotline at 1-877-327-BLUE. The hotline is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.If your insurance company doesn't have a hotline, you can write to an agent or other insurance employee and provide the information you have about the possible fraud. 

review your statement to verify accuracy.  ask your doctor to explain entries.  learn to recognize some common examples of billing issues that might constitute fraud.  report discrepancies to your insurance company.  fill out a complaint form.  send a tip through email.  call the company's hotline. 

 The Snapchat icon looks like a white ghost in a yellow box. Snapchat will open up to your camera screen.; , This will open your Snapchat Home screen.  This button is in the upper-right corner of your Home screen. It will open your Settings menu.  This option will be at the bottom of the MY ACCOUNT section on your Settings menu.  The switch will turn green. All of your Stories will now automatically save to your Memories collection.   If your Save To... option under SAVING is set to Camera Roll Only, you won't see the Auto-Save Stories switch on the menu. You have to change it to Memories or Memories & Camera Roll.

 Have at least 60 strength, 75 attack and 60 defence. If your player is weak, you will get killed, and that's not very helpful for the person you are trying to rescue. Other than the fact that you delayed their death for about 5 seconds.; , Bring a lot of food to replenish your health. Heroes stop being heroes when they run to a bank to get extra food, leaving their "client" to die!  , Don't call people stupid, even if they are a level 3 and are fighting a Lesser Demon with a bronze pickaxe. Help them out. If they are a level 3, or they have low health, tell them to run and that you will kill the Lesser Demon for them. That also goes to calling people noobs. It is very difficult to tell a person you have a good reputation after calling 5 people noobs, and have them believe you.  Wearing around tattered clothes does not put a good image in people's minds. You might even be mistaken as a one of the tramps that hang around in Varrock. Your outfit does not need to be extremely expensive, but you don't want people thinking you are stingy. A set of black gowns is OK, as is your full Saradomin armor completed with skillcape.  It is very unlikely that players will all be crowded around one spot shouting "Help!". You don't want to seem like you have favorites by following people around. It is probably not going to insult someone if you leave them after they are out of danger. If it really does annoy them, explain to them *patiently* that you need to help someone else. If you see people that are in trouble very often, add them to your friends list and tell them to send you a message if they are in trouble.  That way you are most likely to get there before they die. If, by the time you get there, they are already dead, then read their gravestone. That will tell you how long the gravestone will last before crumbling. If you think it will still be there by the time you kill whatever monster that killed them, then do it. When in doubt, be safe. Repairing their grave is a very polite thing to do.  

get a strong character.  get ready for the wilderness, an accident-prone spot.  no name calling.  have a nice appearance.  wander around.  if someone is asking for help, get there as soon as possible. 

 Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, stir in the pasta. Wait for the water to return to a boil, and cook the pasta for six minutes. After six minutes, add the beans and broccoli and boil for an additional two minutes.After two minutes, remove the pot from the heat.  Pour the pasta and vegetables into a large colander to drain the water. Rinse everything with cold water to remove excess starch. Let the pasta and vegetables drip dry for a couple minutes, then return them to the pot.Set the pot aside while you cook the remaining ingredients.  Pour the oil into a large skillet and heat it over medium heat. When the oil is shimmering, add the mushrooms, pepper, and chicken. Season with the Italian seasoning, and salt and pepper, to taste.

 You can type up your permission slips using a program like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or Pages. For most cases, use a clear and standard font such as Times New Roman or Arial in size 11 or 12.; , Answer all the questions that pertain to the specific activity. These could include: who, what, when, where, why, how much, as well as the means of transportation. This information, which summarizes the trip, should be at the top of the document. Here is an example of how these questions can be answered in the permission slip:Who: Mrs. Tucker’s English class What: The class will be taking a trip to the Alberta Street Library. When: 8:30am - 11:30am, Friday, May 10th, 2019 Where: The Alberta Street Library Why: The class will be going to take a tour of the library. Cost: No cost Means of Transportation: We will take a school bus.  You need to have a statement where the parent or guardian writes that they give permission for their child to take the trip. Here is an example of this line: I, (parent or guardian’s name), give permission for my child, (child’s name), to attend the field trip to (location of field trip) with (organization or adult’s name who is leading the trip).  If a child has specific allergies or a medical condition, or if the trip is over an extended period of time, include space for the parent or guardian to give information about allergies and medical conditions.   Write this as, “Relevant Allergies/Medical Conditions:_________.”  , Create a line for an emergency contact phone number on the slip. This is the person that can be called if something happens to the child and their parent or guardian can't be reached.You can write "Emergency Contact Name: _________" and "Emergency Contact Phone Number: _________."  , Perhaps the most important part of the permission slip is the parent or guardian’s signature. At the bottom of all the information about the trip, the parent or guardian needs to sign the paper! Write “Parent or Guardian Signature: _________” at the bottom of the slip. 

use a word-processing program on your computer.  include all of the relevant details for the activity.  create a line for the parent or guardian to give explicit permission.  include space for medical details.  add an emergency contact option.  ask for the parent or guardian's signature. 

 The first thing to do when troubleshooting static is to methodically disconnect each piece of equipment that is connected to your phone line. This includes other phones, answering machines, DSL modems, fax machines, computers connected via dial-up, and alarm systems.  Each time you disconnect a piece of equipment, listen for static on the line. If the static stops, then the last piece you disconnected is likely causing the interference.   Try plugging the offending piece of equipment into a different jack if possible.  It's possible the jack itself is causing the interference, and not the device that was connected. If the static returns after plugging in a different phone or device, you'll need to replace the jack. See Install a Residential Telephone Jack for instructions.  If you're experiencing static or other interference on your cordless phone, there may be too many signals on the frequency. Look for a Channel button on your handset or on the base station. Change channels until you find one clear of interference.  Certain electronics impede on the frequency used by cordless phones, and moving or turning off this equipment may help your signal.Try to keep cordless phones out of your kitchen, as microwave ovens will often disrupt the signal. Home wireless networks running on 802.11b/g are operating on the same frequency as your cordless phone (2.4GHz. You may need to upgrade your router to one that supports 5GHz wireless. See Choose a Wireless Router for more information. Baby monitors, bluetooth devices, and other cordless phones can all cause interference.  

disconnect telephone equipment one at a time while listening on the phone.  listen for the static to go away.  test the offending jack by plugging in a different phone or device.  try changing channels on your cordless phones.  move or disable interfering equipment. 

 Texture describes the way a rock looks. Grain size is the main texture you look for when classifying igneous rock. Grain size is the size of the individual mineral crystals in the rock.Coarse-grained (phaneritic) describes rocks with large crystals. Most intrusive rocks are considered coarse-grained because of their large crystals. Fine-grained (aphanitic) describes rocks with crystals that are too small to see with the naked eye. Most extrusive rocks are considered fine-grained rocks. Rocks that cool quickly may have trapped bubbles of gas called vesicles. The texture of these rocks is vesicular. Porphyritic texture rocks have both fine-grained and coarse-grained crystals., You can examine the chemical composition of a rock just by looking at it. Minerals vary in color, and the color tells you what chemicals are in the rock. The most common chemicals are silica, iron, and magnesium.Light colored minerals (often called felsic) have more silica in them and are often white, gray, pink, or colorless. Dark-colored minerals (often called mafic) have more iron and magnesium in them are usually black, brown, dark gray, or green.  Igneous rock can be classified as felsic, intermediate, mafic, and ultramafic. These classifications apply to both extrusive and intrusive rocks.Felsic rocks are the lightest, and ultramafic rocks are the darkest.Felsic rocks have the highest silica content (65% +). Common examples of felsic rocks are rhyolite (extrusive rock) and granite (intrusive rock). Intermediate rocks have about 55-65% silica content and are a little darker than felsic rocks. Common examples of intermediate rocks are andesite/dacite (extrusive rock) and diorite/granodiorite (intrusive rock). Mafic rocks are low in silica (45-55%) and are dark in color. Common examples of mafic rocks are basalt (extrusive rock) and gabbro (intrusive rock). Ultramafic rocks have the lowest silica content (less than 45%) and may have a green tint. Common examples of ultramafic rocks are peridotite (intrusive rock) and komatiite (extrusive rock).  

examine the texture of the rock.  examine the chemical composition.  know the four classifications of igneous rock.

 You will need to loop the yarn around your fingers so that the yarn you are working with, or the end attached to the larger ball, lies on the right while the "tail" of the yarn lies on the left.      ; , Slide the crochet hook under both pieces of yarn from right to left.          Use the hook tip to grab onto a portion of yarn from the working end (ball end) of the yarn.  Pull the portion of yarn you grabbed through the ring to create another loop on your hook.         Note that this does not count as your first stitch.  Create as many chain stitches as the pattern calls for. , Hold the working end of the yarn taut while gently pulling down on the tail end. As you do this, the stitches should close together at the center, completing your magic ring.  To close this round and start the remainder of your pattern, make a slip stitch into the first stitch of your ring, and proceed to the next round.

 Above, we've dealt with specific, individual ways to chill out. However, this isn't telling the whole story — in order to truly live a chilled-out life, you'll want to adopt habits and behaviors that encourage a happy, relaxed state of being. One sure-fire way to do this is to make an effort to regularly spend time outdoors. It may seem clichéd, but large-scale scientific studies have proven that spending time outside — especially getting moderate exercise — noticeably elevates mood.Though the connection between time outdoors and a good mood still isn't 100% understood, sunlight seems to be a key part of the equation. In fact, studies have shown that being exposed to bright (artificial) light in the morning when it would normally be dark out can help people with Seasonal Affective Disorder feel better.For long-term benefits, try making outdoor activity a part of your weekly schedule. For example, going for a short hike every Saturday morning is a good way to get yourself feeling relaxed and energized for the rest of your weekend.  As noted above, a single session of exercise is a proven, fast-acting cure for stress in the short term. However, regular exercise is also a great way to promote a relaxed, chill attitude in the long term. Though the biology behind the process isn't perfectly understood, scientific research has demonstrated that habitual exercise can act as a buffer against the sorts of unhealthy problems that can result from stress, especially depression.Check out our comprehensive article on exercise for all sorts of useful information on making exercise a part of your life, including sample routines for every skill level.  The way we sleep can have a major effect on the way we feel when we're awake — just think back to the last time you pulled an all-nighter and try to remember how you felt the next day. While a single night of missed sleep can make you feel bad for a day or so, consistently getting insufficient sleep can be a major source of stress in the long run. In fact, people who consistently get poor sleep have elevated risks of suffering from stress-related disorders like heart disease, stroke, and more.For the best chance at a healthy, chill life, make an effort to get enough sleep every night (most health resources recommend about seven to nine hours per night for adults.)It's also important to recognize that the relationship between sleep and stress works the other way as well. In other words, just like a lack of sleep can lead to stress, stress can itself can make it difficult to get to sleep.  

get outdoors.  get plenty of exercise.  get plenty of rest. 

 You can only fly in Creative Mode. You choose the game mode when you create the world, and there is no built-in way to change it.   You can search your app store for a mod that allows you to change game modes. However, most of these do not work for Minecraft PE versions 0.9 and later.If you do download a mod, be aware that it is not officially supported and could cause issues with your game.  If you are in Creative Mode, you should start flying. On some versions, the jump symbol will change to a pair of wings., Hold the jump button and swipe your finger up to fly higher, or down to sink lower. You can also move using the usual controls.   You can also drop down by double-tapping the center jump button.If you are playing on the Xperia Play gamepad, hold jump while pressing up or down. 

choose a creative mode world.  tap the jump button twice.  swipe up or down from the jump button. 

 Scrub it well and pat dry. Make sure the surface is clean and free of any dirt, so it will be ready for decoration and carving.; , Draw a circle around the circumference of one end of the watermelon where you'll remove the top. You may want to use a drawing compass for accuracy, or simply sketch as neat a line as possible.  Mark parts of the watermelon using a pencil or a Sharpie. You will most likely fill the watermelon with punch three quarters of the way, so if you want to carve any decorative shapes or designs toward the top, map out the design now.  You'll need the top as a lid that goes back on the melon after you’ve added the punch. Use your sharpest kitchen knife or a box cutter to slice cleanly through the melon. Follow the pre-drawn lines when cutting; this will make it easier.  Clean it of any residual watermelon, and then set it aside.  Lay down newspaper or sheeting underneath the watermelon—this is going to get messy! You could also place the watermelon in a deep sink to reduce mess. Just like carving a pumpkin—only wetter—scoop out as much flesh as possible with an ice cream scoop or large spoon.          When scraping out the flesh, take care not to scrape too much of the skin. The idea is to hollow out the watermelon neatly without creating indentations in the outer edge.  Try to remove the watermelon in chunks so you can use the fruit later either in your punch or as a snack.  Remove any errant seeds or pieces. You should be left with a smooth, hollow surface.  Make a hole toward the bottom portion of the watermelon using an apple corer. A hole approximately two to three inches (5 to 7.5cm) from the base of the watermelon is appropriate. Then when the watermelon sits on a table, guests can easily place their glass underneath the spigot.          Make the keg hole the same size as the spigot line. You will want to fit the spigot snugly into the hole created by the corer, but not so large that a gap is created. If the spigot line has a sharp edge and the watermelon skin is not overly tough, try puncturing the skin using the spigot and bypass using the apple corer. You may find that you get a tighter fit this way.  A punch recipe that infuses watermelon or watermelon flavors would be most desirable, but any punch recipe will work.  Pour only a few cups of the mixture into the watermelon to determine if the spigot will leak. If it has a leak, fill the gaps with either pieces of rind or even duct tape around the inside the spigot line, inside the watermelon. Hold the duct tape in place with pins if it does not adhere to the watermelon (which it very well may not given the wet and slippery surface).  Integrate pieces of watermelon flesh into your brew when preparing it. This will further enhance the flavor and taste. If possible, re-use the chunks of watermelon in your punch and float several pieces inside the punch for good visual effect.  Decorate the watermelon using other pieces of fruit. For example, you could create a fun face using apple pieces, dried fruit and watermelon chunks. Affix fruit pieces to the watermelon using toothpicks.  

wash the watermelon.  mark the cut line.  draw decorative features.  cut off the top of the watermelon.  gently remove the top.  scoop out the watermelon flesh.  save the goodies.  clean out the inside of the watermelon using a wet paper towel.  create the “watermelon keg”.  fill the fruit keg with your favorite punch recipe.  test first!,  add watermelon.  place the watermelon keg on display. 

 Do you want to be quiet and reserved? Funny and witty? Outgoing, smart, independent, kind, fearless? Make a list of at least 10 characteristics you would like to display the most and that represent your true self. When you're satisfied that you've homed in on the most true characteristics for yourself, start portraying them in your everyday life.; , While it's important to not copy somebody completely, as social beings we are naturally creatures of imitation and striving to improve ourselves often includes following healthy and admirable examples. For example, if you admire somebody's sense of humor, you could incorporate their way of telling jokes into your way, melding the two until your own unique sense of humor comes to the fore with confidence.  Remember, you are your own person and you have to be happy with who you've become and continue to become over the decades. If you aren't satisfied with yourself, it's okay to keep working on it. It's also okay to change every few years––it's how human beings keep on growing, learning and relearning.   Keep in mind that this process of bringing forth your true self won't happen overnight. It will take as long as you need it to, which is perfectly fine! In the end, the only validation of who you are that matters is your own.  You are amazing just the way you are and negative criticism is both unhelpful and unkind. Let the negative remarks go in through one ear and right out the other. Does it really matter what people think of you? The people who really mean the most are those who stick by your side and respect and love you for who you are. However, this isn't to say that you can't learn from positive and constructive feedback about improving yourself––those you trust will sometimes be excellent sources of suggestions for ways to improve yourself that will help bring out your true talents and abilities.  It's hard to stay true to yourself when everyone around you is influencing or pressuring you to be something or someone other than yourself. Choose your friends wisely. Be close with genuinely kind and nice people, not cruel or detracting ones. Make sure that your friends support and admire you for being yourself; if they don't, question their motives and the reasons for your friendships.  Before anyone else can love you, you have to love yourself in a healthy way. Don't be too rough on yourself. Nobody is perfect, no matter how close they may seem. Every flaw you have makes you who you are and a "flaw" one day may be a "feature" some other day, as often it depends on context and finding your true direction in life. One bad day doesn't mean you're destined for a terrible life.   Be very careful about what you choose to do with your life. If you pursue a career that isn't aligned with your personality type and true inner talents, you may end up being miserable and constantly on the back foot. Take your time in working out what you are best at and don't commit completely to a career, job, vocation, etc., until you're one hundred percent sure it is right for you. This process may change again and again through your life, so expect to transform now and then.  Learn to embrace your flaws––they are apart of you, and that won't change. Balance these by acknowledging and making the most of your features and putting your best self forward as much as possible. People will recognize the best in you when you acknowledge this yourself.  

think about the type of person you want to be.  take pieces of other people to create yourself.  repeat the "creating process" as just outlined, if necessary.  don't pay attention to others' hateful, spiteful or detracting opinions of you.  surround yourself with good people.  treat yourself kindly.  love yourself. 

 Dividers are cardboard pieces inside box that is used to keep the items it stored snug and stationary during travel.; , Do not use wet cloth because it will damage the box.

 Before you can get started you will need to collect all the materials required by the the project. All of these materials will be used at some point so make sure you have them all collected. Take a look at the following items to learn what you will need:A chrome novelty motorcycle helmet. Printable mask templates, made by Luchofunk, which can be found on-line. At least five sheets of card-stock. Glue or glue gun Small wooden sticks, coat hanger, or crafting foam to add support. Two cans of soda. Car mirror replacement sheets or silver vinyl. Programmable LED belt buckle. A clear plastic sheet. Spray on window tint.; , Depending on what type of helmet you've bought you may need to remove extra material from it. These might be black liners that run along the edge of the helmet, stickers, or molding. Your goal is to have your helmet looking smooth, with only the shining chrome pieces showing., You won't need to create your own templates to build the front of your mask. Instead, you can download these templates and then print them out. These templates will ensure that your mask face is the proper size and shape when you add them to your helmet.You can find the mask files on-line. You won't need to download the ear mask files as you will be using soda cans instead. Print the templates on the card-stock.  Once you've printed the mask files out on your card-stock you can cut them out, form them, and then glue them to your mask. Doing this will form the face of your mask.You can attach wooden sticks or wire for extra support. Craft foam can also work well for adding extra support. Apply any support to the back or inside of the mask.  Now that you have your cardstock face attached to the helmet you will want to cover them in either the mirror replacement sheets or vinyl. This will cover up the paper texture and give your mask a shiny metallic look. Cut the mirror sheets or vinyl to the sizes of your mask face and glue them on to complete the look.You can spray paint the whole mask first with a metallic silver paint. After painting the mask you can apply the silver metallic vinyl.  You will to cut two soda cans in half to create the ears of your mask. The part you will be attaching to your mask is the bottom half of the soda cans. Attach one of the soda can bottoms on each side of the mask with glue or hot glue.If the can has an image printed on it you can paint them with your silver paint or apply silver vinyl. Cut the cans in half, going around the middle of the can. You want to end up with the bottom of the can for use on your mask. The cans will be attached on the outside of the mask in the area where Bangalter's are located.  Now that your mask frame is complete it's time to build the visor. Take your clear plastic sheet and cut it to the size that you will need to completely cover the visor area of your mask. Once you've cut out the shape of the visor you can tint it using your tint-spray to complete the visor.Don't cut the visor to the exact size of the mask. Leave about 1/2” of material so that you can glue it to the inside of the mask later on.  After your visor has been cutout, tinted, and dried you can attach it to your mask. You will be attaching it to the inside of your mask using your hot glue gun or other adhesive. Gluing it to the inside of your mask will help hide the glue and keep your masking looking clean.The visor is attached on the inside of your mask. Apply your adhesive inside the mask, around the edge where the hole for the visor is. Stick the visor to the inside of the mask by placing it so that it comes in contact with your glue. Putting the visor on the inside of your helmet will help keep its visible lines clean and flush with the outside of the mask. You can also place your visor in the mask and then tape it in place.  Before you install your LED belt buckle you will need to program it. Programming your LED belt buckle will allow you to display anything you might want to when your mask is being worn. Think about programming in some of your favorite lyrics or other Daft Punk icons.Each LED belt buckle will come with it's own programming instructions. Many LED belt buckles will allow for a number of words to be programmed into them.  The last step in completing your helmet it to attach the LED belt buckle to your visor. Tape the LED belt buckle to the inside center of your visor. This will allow any programmed text or images to be seen through the visor, completing your Daft Punk mask.Put your helmet on and see how it looks. You should be able to see the LEDs through the front of the visor. You won't be able to see directly through the LED buckle. However, you will still be able to see through the rest of the visor just fine. Make any adjustments that you might need to.  

gather your materials.  remove extra pieces from your helmet.  download and print the mask files.  assemble and glue the paper mask cutouts to the helmet.  cut mirror sheets or vinyl to the shape of the mask.  cut soda cans in half and attach them with glue.  cutout and tint the clear plastic visor.  attach the tinted visor to the helmet.  program your led belt buckle.  attach the led belt buckle to the visor.

 Italian Greyhounds are affectionate, gentle, and love to spend most of their time with their owner or family.While they’re sociable and get along well with children and other dogs, they might shy away at first. If you’re thinking about getting an Italian Greyhound, make sure you have plenty of time for both snuggling and activities.Do your best not to leave your Italian Greyhound alone for more than a few hours. If you can, stop at home during your lunch break for a quick walk. Spend nights and weekends giving it plenty of affection if you work during the day.; , Even though they love to nap and sit on laps, Italian Greyhounds are swift and agile, and need a moderate amount of exercise. Go on a couple 15 to 30 minute brisk walks a day.Daily running or sprinting helps strengthen their legs and prevent the risk of injury. Their size makes them great apartment dogs, and they don't really have any breed-specific space requirements. However, they do benefit from having an enclosed area large enough to sprint and exercise their legs. Avoid play with young children or larger dogs and other situations that could cause your dog injury. Be especially careful about your puppy’s playtime, as young Italian Greyhounds are particularly fragile.  This breed loves to stalk and chase prey, so having balls and fetch toys is a must. Give it chew toys and stuffed animals that it can hunt and chomp on so it doesn't get bored. Making sure it has toys to chew will cut down on any possible damage to your furniture and clothing.A bored Italian Greyhound, like many breeds, can get mischievous and chew up your belongings. Make sure it has its own toys to keep it busy.  Since they’re so intelligent, Italian Greyhounds enjoy the mental exercise that comes with training. Start out with basic word commands, such as sit, stay, and come.Hold a treat out, say the command, and gently guide your dog into the proper position when just starting to train. Repeat ten or twenty time to make it automatic, and make sure to give a treat and positive encouragement when your dog follows the command. Keep training session short and fun, since Italian Greyhounds typically have short attention spans. Always make training rewards-based by using treats and incorporating it into playtime.  While they are intelligent and are trainable, Italian Greyhounds tend to be difficult to housetrain. If you get a puppy, begin housetraining immediately, and get it on a regular food and potty schedule.Take your dog out 15 to 30 minutes after eating, and feed your dog at the same times every day. Take it out a few times a day in addition to after eating, including first thing in the morning and a half hour before bed. Consider using the crate method. Purchase a crate that allows free movement but isn’t too big. Leave the dog in a crate while at work or at night, letting it out every few hours if possible.Don’t scold your dog if you come home to find a mess. If the dog had the accident hours earlier, it won’t make a connection between being scolded and going to the bathroom inside. Try leaving pads or paper mats out if you don’t want to use a crate.  

spend a lot of time with your dog.  give your dog the right amount of exercise.  give your italian greyhound toys.  train your dog.  housetrain your italian greyhound. 

 You will need this when the plane is taking off and landing, as electronics will not be allowed. Books are a staple, as well as small crafts (ex. thread bracelets, coloring books)=; , If the airline you are traveling on gives free snacks, you may not need to. However, candy is sold all around the airport, and packing it means you don't have to pay outrageous airport prices for it. Unlike going to the movie theatre, this isn't even against the rules.   Pick clean snacks. This isn't the time to be finishing off your leftover chicken wings.  Music is a good distraction, and, especially important for red-eye flights, an excellent way to help your child fall asleep. On nearly all planes you will not have wifi, so be sure there are some games downloaded that don't need the internet.

If the ride is long a pillow and blanket will really help, or your child may wish to bring a stuffed animal.   Whatever you bring should be washable. Airplanes are not the cleanest of places, and Mr Stuffins probably shouldn't be going directly from one to being pressed up against your child's face in their bed.  Airplanes can be cold.  Because of the size of their ear canals, changes in pressure affect small children even more than adults. Save it for when you are landing, and then give it to them. It will force them to swallow and help the descent be less painful.

 Hair and soap often accumulate underneath the strainer, which is located in or over the drain. Though many strainers can be removed manually, some have screws that will need to be removed, too. Remove the screws with the proper screwdriver.   If you do not know which type of screwdriver to use, match the screwdriver to the screw head.The size and shape of the screwdriver head should easily fit into the screw. Turn each screw surrounding the strainer until all are loose. Then, place the screws in a safe location while you unclog the drain.; , Some drains have tub stoppers instead of strainers, and these are also located in the drain. These are easier to remove because they are not held down with any screws. Simply remove the stopper by twisting and lifting it., A lot of gunk may have accumulated on the strainer or stopper over time. Clean any hair or soap scum; you may have to scrub the strainer and stopper depending on how dirty they are.  When the drain stick is inserted deep enough, it will hit a drain trap, which is a curved part of the drain.Keep pushing the drain stick through this trap. The stick is flexible and will bend.  The claw has many small interlocking hooks, so it will grab hair and allow you to pull gunk out. Clean the gunk off of the drain stick if you want to save it to use again in the future. Hair and soap can build up in as little as a few months, so having a drain stick often comes in handy.  Water should now go down the drain properly. If this method did not work, try another method.  If the drain claw worked, you can now replace your strainer or stopper. Strainers will need to be screwed back onto the top of the drain, whereas you can just place the stopper back in the drain.  

remove the strainer.  remove the stopper.  remove excessive gunk around the strainer and stopper.  insert the drain stick down the drain.  pull out the drain stick.  test the bathtub to see if it is unclogged.  replace the cover or stopper the same way that you removed it. 

 When you bring your dog into the vet, you should give them a thorough summary of your dog’s medical history. Note any previous health issues your dog may have had as well as details of when the symptoms of prostate disease started to appear. You may also note any incidents that could have caused the condition or made it worse.For example, you may tell your vet, “My dog stopped eating a few days ago and is very lethargic, with a high fever. He has never been like this before and I am worried he may have prostate infection as he is an older, intact dog.”  , Your vet will start by doing a full physical exam on your dog, including a close examination of his prostate. They may insert a gloved finger into your dog’s rectum to feel their prostate gland. If your dog reacts with pain or the prostate feels larger than usual, your vet may suggest a biopsy of the prostate gland for testing. Your dog may be sedated during the biopsy so he does not feel any pain or discomfort.This is done to assess the size of the prostate, if it is symmetrical, and if it is painful or not.   If your dog reacts with pain or the prostate feels larger than usual, your vet may suggest a prostic wash to harvest a sample of cells from the prostate. Biopsy of the prostate gland is tricky as the gland is difficult to access, and so your vet will carefully assess if this is necessary or not. Your dog will be given an anesthetic during the biopsy so he does not feel any pain or discomfort. In some dogs, their prostate may recede too far into their abdominal area to be felt in a physical exam. If this is the case, your vet will suggest an ultrasound on your dog’s abdominal area to get a better look at his prostate.  Your vet will then run standard laboratory tests on your dog, including getting a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Your vet will need a sample of your dog’s urine to run the urinalysis. The urinalysis will help your vet determine if there is blood in his urine, this could be a symptom of prostate disease., Once your vet has completed a physical exam of your dog and ran the necessary tests, they will determine the cause of the issue and suggest a treatment plan. If your dog’s prostate disease is due to a hormonal imbalance, your vet may recommend castration or hormone-blocking medication to reduce your dog’s symptoms. If your dog’s prostate issue is caused by a bacterial infection, your dog will be given antibiotics.If your dog’s symptoms are severe and he has a ruptured, abscessed prostate, he may need surgery on his prostate. Your vet will let you know the timeline for the surgery and give your dog antibiotic therapy to stabilize his condition before the surgery can be performed.  

share your dog’s medical history with your vet.  let your vet examine your dog’s prostate.  allow your vet to run tests on your dog.  get a treatment plan. 

 Pens that are made completely from plastic will melt if you attempt to smoke, so the metal tip is important to prevent the plastic from melting in the heat., Take the pen completely apart to obtain the metal tip and hollow shaft of the pen.   Unscrew the tip from the pen. Remove the writing tip, ink chamber, and spring mechanism. Remove the back end of the pen.  Insert the narrow end of the metal tip into the hollow shaft of the pen. Push it in as far as possible to create a seal between the pen and the metal tip. You can use a lighter to melt the plastic slightly to force the tip to bind to the end of the pen.  Place a small amount of smoking material in the pen tip carefully to avoid breaking the seal between the pen and the tip.  Breathe in through the end of the pen while you light the smoking material contained in the metal tip.  

find a pen with metal tip.  disassemble the pen.  place the metal tip in the pen backwards.  fill the metal pen tip with smoking material.  light the smoking material and inhale. 

 Ask yourself if the salary is appropriate for the area you will live, your personal budget, and the amount of experience you have in your profession. You can figure out if the salary is appropriate by checking salary guides online, talking to mentors, or looking into what the company usually pays employees in your position. If you don’t think the offer is reasonable, you can try to negotiate the salary., If you’ve done your research and feel that the offer isn’t enough, then you can try to negotiate for a salary that you would be happier with. Negotiating salary is not unusual, so don’t feel shy about doing it. Come up with an amount that you think is realistic. Then, contact your potential employer by phone, email, or in person and tell them what your ideal salary would be. Keep in mind that they may say reject the offer. If they do, ask to take some time to make a counter offer or have a counter offer ready.Explain to them why you would be a valuable employee and why your ideal salary is reasonable. Tell the potential employer how you are genuinely interested in the job. Do not get defensive if the answer is no in the end.  Benefits should be considered along with salary. Benefits include important things like healthcare, but it also includes more minor things. Consider if your company has a gym, wellness programs, tuition reimbursement, and flexible hours. You can negotiate for your benefits when and if you negotiate salary. It’s also an option to negotiate for better benefits if the company is unwilling to compromise on salary.Benefits also include your 401(k), travel stipend, and paid time off. You should research what benefits are typical for someone in your position. Check out what the company’s competition offers as a benefits package if possible.  You shouldn’t ask to go on vacation right away, but it’s okay to ask what the vacation package is like. Consider how much vacation you will need to visit family or keep from burning out at work. If the offer has less days than expected, you could try to negotiate. Research what the typical vacation time is for someone in your position with your level of experience. Come up with an amount of vacation time that seems reasonable. Present this amount of time when and if you negotiate for salary and benefits., You may be offered the job directly on the phone. If not, you might be asked to call back. It's best to call the hiring manager responsible for interviewing you. You can go ahead and let them know that you intend to accept the offer, or have questions answered first before accepting.Don't leave a voice message indicating your acceptance of the job offer. If the hiring manager isn't present, leave a voice message indicating you'd like to talk to them about the job offer.  It’s important to express your gratitude for the opportunity. Let them know how excited or thrilled you are to have been offered the position. If you aren’t ready to say yes at this point in the call, expressing appreciation is vague enough to let them know you’re interested without committing before questions have been answered., Once you’ve had all of your questions answered, ask for the details of this conversation to be sent to you in writing. Ask them to write down the salary, benefits, start, and start dates that were discussed during the phone call. That doesn’t show your potential employer that you don’t trust them. It’s just a way to protect yourself in case the employer goes back on their word., It’s especially important to know this if you currently have a job that you need to give notice to. You can ask for a later start date if the date given doesn’t work for you. Don’t push it too much, though., You can address it to a different person if you are asked to, though. Make sure to write down your contact information and phone number at the end so the employer can get in touch with you.  Your future employer may already know that you've accepted the job, so don't ramble on about how good of a fit you are and what you can offer the company. They know this by now if they offered you the position. You should, however, include the following:Thanks and appreciation for the opportunity Direct acceptance of the job offer Starting date of employment  , Because it's sometimes tough to recall every single detail of the job before you've actually started it, you may need to ask your contact questions about your future employment. Don’t feel like you’re being annoying. This is expected by the employer. These questions can include, but are not limited to:   Questions about supervisors and/or who you'll be reporting to. Questions about work eligibility and/or visa requirements if accepting a job overseas.  This may not be applicable, but it is good to let them know if there will be any conflicts. You don’t want to surprise them after you’ve started the job. Be sure to remind your liaison of any dates you will not be able to work on because you scheduled something before you accepted the position.   For example, if you agreed to travel across the country for your grandfather's 80th birthday two weeks after your start date, inform your liaison that you won't be able to work those days because of a prior scheduling conflict  , Finally, you can say “yes” to the offer. Congratulations! You can say something like “I would be happy to accept this position.” Or, “I’m thrilled to accept the offer and become a team member.”, Make sure that your email is well-written and that you've proofread it for typos and grammatical errors. Even though you already have been offered the job, you want to make sure all your correspondence is professional. They likely won’t revoke the offer due to a few grammatical errors, but it could be embarrassing. 

accept the salary if you think it’s reasonable.  negotiate the salary if you aren’t satisfied with the original offer.  inquire about the benefits.  ask about vacation.  accept the offer over the phone first.  express your appreciation.  ask for a written letter.  ask about the start date.  address the email to the person who offered you the position.  make your email brief.  clarify any questions you may have had.  inform the contact of any scheduling conflicts.  accept the offer directly.  read over the email. 

 Dispense a dollop of light hair mousse into the palm of your hand. Rub your hands together to spread it, then work the mousse into your hair, moving from the bottom up.   Use a light mousse, not a heavy one. You'll be using the mousse to make your hair fuller and easier to manipulate, so it doesn't need to hold your hair in place. If you don't have mousse, work with hair that hasn't been washed in a full 24 hours. The oils from your scalp should have coated your hair during this time, giving it more structure and making it easier to shape than freshly washed hair.; , Use a comb to draw a curved line from temple to temple. Tie back the bottom portion of hair using a hair band.The line should gradually curve upward from one temple, then curve downward as it reaches the other temple. The highest part of the curve should be the back center of your head, and it should be nearly high enough to reach your natural part. When creating the victory rolls, you'll only work with the top portion of hair. Tying back the bottom portion can keep it out of your way and make it easier to complete the rolls.  Use your comb to create a straight, deep side part.   If you have side-swept bangs, section your hair so that the part lands on the opposite side of your bangs. If you don't have bangs, draw the part on either side. You'll work with the smaller of these two sections first, so it might be a good idea to clip or loosely tie back the larger section until you're ready for it.  Separate the smaller section of hair into three sub-sections. Tease the top and middle thirds along the underside of the hair, then tease the bottom third along the top of the hair.   Use a standard comb or boar bristled teasing brush while teasing your hair. Hold the hair taut with one hand. Using your other hand, brush upward along the sub-section, moving closer to the scalp. Start approximately 3 inches (7.6 cm) away from the scalp and work along the length of each sub-section in 3-inch (7.6-cm) intervals.  Release the larger side of hair, then separate it into five sub-sections. Tease the top four sub-sections along the underside, then tease the bottom fifth along the top side.   Follow the same teasing procedure for this larger side as you followed for the smaller side. Note that you're still only working with the top section of hair; the bottom section should remain tied back in a ponytail.  Form a line of bobby pins along both sides of the part. Position the pins roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the part.   Start each line at the back of the part. Lay the pins from end-to-end, continuing until you nearly reach the front of your forehead. Stop at least 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) away from your forehead. This step isn't strictly necessary, but following it will create a base for your victory rolls, which may make it easier to shape them correctly.  Gather together the hair along the small side of your part. Bring the ends over and around to the top, forming a loop. Continue rolling over this loop until you reach your row of bobby pins.To create the right shape and width, position two fingers roughly 3 inches (7.6 cm) above the ends of the hair and roll the ends around them. Tuck in the ends to keep the roll tidy. Continue rolling toward your scalp, keeping it as neat as possible the entire time. Alternatively, you can roll the section around a 1-inch (2.5-cm) curling iron instead of your fingers. Doing so can produce a smoother, neater roll.  Gently remove your fingers or curling iron from the center of the roll, then slide a bobby pin into the roll through the front to hold it together. Insert a second bobby pin through the back of the roll to make it more secure.   Secure both bobby pins through the bottom of the roll and into the hair lying directly along your scalp. Right now, the roll should look like a small "o" with a hollow center.  Use your hand to gently flatten the back of the roll, closing it off. Pin the bottom of the roll in place using another bobby pin or two.   If necessary, shape the front of the roll during this step as well, making it as rounded as possible. You can use more bobby pins to help hold the shape of the roll, but make sure that each one remains hidden somewhere within the roll itself.  Cover all sides of the first victory roll with hairspray to help hold the final shape.   Cover your unrolled hair with one of your hands to prevent the hairspray from soaking into it too much. It's best to spray down each roll individually instead of waiting until you complete both. By spraying the first roll now, you'll protect it from possible disturbances as you work on the shape of the second roll.  Gather the hair together along the larger side of your part. Follow the same steps to create another victory roll from this portion of hair.   Roll the hair, pin the roll down, shape the roll, and apply hairspray. Note that this roll can be more difficult to complete than the first since you'll be working with more hair. Be patient and work slowly. When finished, the two rolls should be mirrored side-by-side down the length of your part. The victory rolls are complete, but you'll still need to style the bottom portion of hair previously tied back.  Untie the bottom portion of your hair. Comb it out, working the brush straight down until your hair seems smooth again.   Unless your hair was wavy or curly before you began, this bottom section will likely seem out of place with your victory rolls. There are several ways to create a matching style, but the simplest is to leave the lower section down and give a loose, wavy curl.  Use a 2-inch to 3-inch (5-cm to 7.6-cm) curling iron to curl large sections of your remaining, loose hair. Work around your entire head until you achieve a result you feel pleased with.The waves or curls of this section should spiral down vertically. Do not curl the hair in horizontal sections. To give the look a little more pizzazz, form tighter curls toward the ends of each section. You can use your curling iron for this, or you can make the curls more pronounced by accentuating them with a round hair brush.  Cover your face and spray your entire head of hair with more hairspray. Use enough spray to help hold both the rolls and your loose-hanging waves/curls.   If your hair looks frizzy at this point, you can also use a small amount of hair cream or serum to help tame the frizz and create a smoother style.  You can leave the victory rolls as they are, or you can give the look even more retro, feminine flair by highlighting them with a flower or bow.   For best results, use a bow or flower hair ornament attached to a hair clip. Position the accessory on the side with the smaller victory roll to keep the look balanced. Slide the hair clip into the flat hair toward the front of your face and just above your ear. The ornament should not grab into the hair used to complete the victory roll itself.  Give your victory rolls a final check in a mirror and touch them up as needed. Once you're satisfied with how they look, you should be ready to show off your new victory rolls out in public.  

apply mousse.  separate the top from the bottom.  part your hair along the side.  tease the smaller side.  tease the larger side.  create a line of bobby pins.  roll one section toward the scalp.  pin it in place.  touch up the shape of the roll.  apply plenty of hairspray.  repeat with the second section.  release the bottom portion of hair.  curl the loose hair.  add a final coat of hairspray.  accessorize as desired.  flaunt your new style. 

 Munchkin cats have a lot of energy. They are very fast, and often can be seen running around their house. They love to chase anything from mice to toys. Though they have short legs, that doesn’t stop them from jumping and climbing, even if it takes them longer.They often stand on their hind legs to investigate their surroundings.  This breed is very social, so expect the cat to be outgoing and friendly with people and other pets. They often wrestle and play with other cats and cat-friendly dogs. They love attention from their owners, and love to curl up in your lap.This breed is great with children.  One unique characteristic of this breed is their tendency to steal shiny objects and hide them. They also will take their favorite toys and place them somewhere they can find them later. Don’t be surprised if you find this cat borrowing some of your shiny belongings.Because of this, Munchkin cats have been described as the magpies of the cat species. Try to put away any objects that the cat may try to steal or chew on. If these small objects are swallowed, the cat may choke. Some small objects, such as button batteries, can kill the cat if swallowed.  

look for a fast, agile cat.  expect a loving, affectionate pet.  be aware of their love for shiny objects. 

 Before you commit to owning a Golden Retriever, you should learn a little about the breed to make sure their personality fits with your lifestyle and expectations for a pet.   Golden Retrievers are very popular dogs. They are the 3rd most popular dog breed in the US and much of this is due to their friendly nature. They are a highly adaptable breed and can be comfortable in a rural or urban setting. They do need daily exercise, however, usually in the form of a walk or a run.Golden Retrievers are good family dogs and do well with children. They also tend to be highly trainable and behave amicably with other pets. The one downside is they do not always do well when left along for long periods, so crate training may take extra time.Golden Retrievers are generally well behaved, but they do sometimes act out if they're not getting enough attention. As they are highly social, they need a lot of interaction to stay happy. If you work a lot and have a busy schedule, you may want to consider a different, more independent breed.; , If you have your heart set on a puppy, you need to stop and consider the time commitment behind owning a young dog.   When you get a puppy, you will need to train him for basic behaviors like house breaking, leash manners, and crate training. This takes a great deal of time and patience, so make sure you have free time throughout the day to dedicate to training sessions. Puppies also need more vet appointments during the first year for vaccinations. Even if your puppy has already certain shots, many vaccinations come in multiple rounds. Make sure you have the time and money for extra vet trips. As puppies do not have as full an understanding of boundaries as adult dogs, you'll need to puppy-proof your house before bringing a puppy to your home. That means keeping food, breakable materials, and other items you do not want chewed on or soiled out of the puppy's reach until he's fully trained.  While owning a puppy can be a fun experience, if you do not feel up to the commitment consider taking in an adult dog. Many people are hesitant to adopt if they want a specific breed, but there are Golden Retriever rescues across the country.   Rescues take in Golden Retrievers that have been abandoned by previous owners or rescued from bad pet stores and puppy mills and seek to find permanent homes. Qualifications for adoption vary between rescues, but the application process can be somewhat lengthy. However, the good news is adoption fees for rescued goldens are generally lower than for puppies from breeders.Many people want to go through a rescue for ethical reasons, but still want a puppy. While it is not impossible to secure a puppy through a rescue, it is not highly likely and there may be a very long wait. If you want a puppy, your best bet is to go through a reputable breeder. If you're dedicated to adopting through a rescue, open yourself up to adopting an older dog. 

learn about the breed.  prepare for owning a puppy.  consider adopting an adult dog through a rescue. 

 Egg oil contains:   Long chain polyunsaturated Omega-3 fatty acids like Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) which revitalize the follicle cells. Cholesterol which brings luster and shine to hair as well as eliminates dandruff.  Use shampoo only once as repetition (for a foamy feel) removes the natural lipids of hair and scalp making it dry and brittle.  Regular, continued use is important for proper nourishment of the follicular cell membranes.    Egg oil is mess free and stable. It is a more convenient alternative to egg yolk masks and does not smell like raw egg yolks or cook in the hair during a hot shower. There is no risk of salmonella which could give you an infection.  

massage egg oil well into the scalp for 5-10 minutes and leave it on overnight.  shampoo off in the morning with a mild, preferably herbal shampoo.  use egg oil 2-3 times a week for at least 12 weeks for visible results.  continue long term massage therapy of egg oil to prevent dandruff recurring. 

 Turn your lighter upside down. There will be a small hole in the bottom with a slit leading to a small hole. Insert a push pin into the hole, flip the lighter so the pin is resting against your work surface, and press down on the lighter firmly.You should feel and hear a small "pop" as the pin pushes a metal beebee out of place. This beebee seals the release valve and must be pushed out of the way. To verify the beebee seal has been removed, with the push pin still inserted, shake the lighter. You should be able to hear the beebee rattle around.; , This should only be done with empty lighters. Point the lighter away from your face and remove the push pin. You should hear a puff of air when the pin pulls free.Attempting to purge a lighter that has fuel remaining inside will cause fuel to be sprayed out of the refill valve. To prevent fuel from getting on your work surface, lay down a cover, like newspaper or a drop cloth. Wipe down any areas exposed to fuel with a water dampened rag. Also, your hands may have gotten fuel on them. Wash them with soapy water.  It isn't likely that your butane applicator will fit perfectly into the lighters refill valve. This can cause gas to leak. Slip three rubber grommets that fit snugly onto the applicator.  The rubber of the final grommet should extend just slightly beyond the tip of the butane spray applicator. Circular rubber grommets can be purchased at your local hardware store in variety packs in the hardware section., Turn the lighter upside down so its bottom faces upwards and its top rests on your work surface. Insert the grommet covered tip of the applicator into the refill valve. Press down on the bottle to disengage the refill bottle's release valve.Because of the seal formed by the rubber grommets, you shouldn't hear any noise as the lighter refills. The lighter should refill completely in about five seconds. When finished, release pressure on the refill bottle but keep the applicator inserted in the refill valve., Remove the applicator from the refill valve and quickly seal the valve with your thumb. Hold the valve tightly with your thumb and pick up the push pin with your free hand. Quick as you can, remove your thumb and plug the hole with the push pin.  You may hear some hissing when your thumb is plugging the refill valve. Hold your thumb firmly to reduce the escape of fuel. This part of refilling a disposable lighter can be difficult at first. Move quickly to prevent freshly replenished fuel from escaping., If you've used a push pin with a contoured plastic end, this may get caught on something and pull the pin out. Cut the contoured plastic at its base with clippers and file down any jagged edges with a metal file. 

open the refill valve.  purge remaining air in the lighter.  create a seal on your butane applicator with rubber grommets.  fill the lighter with butane.  seal the refill valve.  remove the end of the push pin when necessary. 

 Now that you know you learn by seeing and watching, utilize this knowledge. Write down what you hear, translating the aural into the visual.   If your teacher shows you a movie or is talking about specific points on a test, write it down. After you write it down, look over it twice. Start speaking your brain's preferred language. If your teacher uses slides while lecturing, it's important to concentrate on the slides. You'll be less likely to remember what he/she said, but you will remember what you saw on the screen.  Take what you're trying to learn and let your eyes use it. This may involve an extra step, but your test scores will certainly lap it up.   Did your professor just say English was 30% French, 30% Latin, 25% Germanic, and 15% other? Great! Pie chart it is! Now, what color do you associate with each? Hone your artsy side. Need to know when the Model T was introduced? Draw a license plate on the back of a car. The number reads 1011908, for October 1st, 1908. Get creative.  Every teacher will stress, "Don't write down everything I say! You'll get so far behind!" Well, you're not an aural learner anyway, so why would you remember what they said?   If your teacher goes much too fast for you to write anything legible, ask them for notes or an outline on their materials. They will love your enthusiasm. You could always write what you learned on wikiHow!  

use written materials and exercises.  use boards, models, and flip charts.  take good notes. 

 Buy some cool new clothes. Cool does not mean the whole rapper outfit. For example, instead of wearing your floral shorts and your old, torn up "The Monkees" shirt, or trying to dress like a rapper with baggy shirts, falling off your butt jeans and a gangster hat, wear nice, darker dress shoes, darker, well fitting jeans and a plain white dress shirt if you're a father. If you're a mother, try cute flats or cute high heels (Just don't wear hooker boots), flattering jeans (Any color, and, if you can pull them off, skinny jeans) for your body, a nice, fun-but-stylish-and-mature shirt (Pick a color that compliments your hair color, eye color, skin color etc.), and maybe a cute necklace and/or a bracelet. Hair doesn't really matter, just have a clean but fun, stylish cut, with a nice colour (In other words, not a strange color. Either dye it an average color, or let it be natural) so that, all in all, you are stylish. Those outfits are cool and stylish. You can be stylish and mature at the same time. Don't wear high socks or short shorts. You don't want to embarrass your child when you drive him or her to school.; , Understand what he or she is saying. Get to know the vocabulary, like the following - Like, hey, wassup, yo, dude and others. Your child does not want you to sound like a teen, but you must understand what is said when talking. You can use some of the language in moderation, but, you know, don't greet your kid's friends saying "Yo, wassup, radical dude?!" Because that isn't how anyone cool talks. That's just freaky. Also, remember that words/sayings come and go as being cool. Even if the saying "He-ey" was cool in the 70's, it really isn't now.  Look up on the internet about new things. Learn about teens from the newspaper or on television.  Develop trust and responsibility with your child. Talk without prying into everything. If he or she wants you to know something, your child will tell you. Do not talk about your child to other children unless you have their permission first.  As you ride, try not to talk about their private life. Talk about school, new movies and new music.  Buy them a small gift for being nice to their little sister. Buy the little sister a small gift when she is nice to her big sister.  Provide a secure and stable home environment. Be a responsible adult role model as you support your child. Your child must know he or she is safe because you will always be there.  Make sure everyone has equal access to the living spaces, but that each also has a purely private space. Treat them with the same degree of respect you would require if you were sharing a house with non-family members.  A kid may seem like they want nothing to do with you when you drop them off in your '84 Cadillac with Oldies playing full blast, but at the end of the day, when something goes wrong, they come to you for help. You are their first love, and they will always return to you for your aid and advice if you let them know you have it and will provide it.  

dress appropriately.  listen to your child.  learn about youth culture.  respect privacy.  offer to give your child and a few friends a ride home from school rather than making them ride the bus.  reward good behavior.  protect your child.  treat your teens as house-mates.  be a good parent. 

 This step saves the hassle of opening bags of candy with sticky fingers later.       ; ,, Add powdered sugar 2 tablespoons at a time and blend the mixture with a mixer until the icing has the consistency of stiff peanut butter. The icing will secure the graham cracker walls of the house and stick the candy decorations to the surface.  Avoid regular thickness sandwich bags because the plastic is too thin and will not hold up to the punishment of being used as a pastry tube. Approximately 1 cup of icing each bag is enough. Make sure that each gingerbread artist has his or her own bag of icing. , You now have an "icing tube". As you decorate, you'll squeeze the icing toward the snipped corner and use it to dispense a bead of icing on your gingerbread house.  Set four of them aside to form the roof and the two long sides of your house.  Use a gentle "sawing" motion with a serrated knife. Use the short end of a cracker to measure the angled line from the center of the long side to the centerline of the cracker. ,, Stick the side edge of the gable end cracker to the bead of icing on the flat side of the wall cracker. The walls should hold each other up.  Use a bead of icing along the bottom to stick the pieces to the pie tin. Also, use a bead of icing where the two walls will join at the corners.  Then, stick the flat of the roof to the top edges of the gable ends and walls. Allow the icing to set for 15 to 20 minutes before handling the house again. If you place candies on it too quickly, you risk collapsing the house. ,          You can also use cereal for the shingles.  Look at these samples for inspiration:          A roof ridge. A candy cane door. Cobblestones. A male teenager's house. An adult's house. Another adult's version. A log cabin. An additional small house.  

separate your christmas candies into bowls.  place an aluminum pie tin upside down in front of you.  ,  combine the egg whites and lemon juice in a large bowl to make royal icing.  place large spoonfuls of the royal icing into quart-size zipped style freezer bags.  seal the bags.  ,  use scissors to snip 1/4" (6 mm) off one corner of the icing filled bag.  count out six whole, uncracked, unseparated, unbroken crackers.  cut the two remaining cracker sheets to form end gable pieces.  repeat for the second gable end.  ,  squeeze icing along the edges of a gable end and 1 whole graham cracker.  ,  place the long edge of the wall cracker vertical to the base edge of the gable end cracker.  add the other gable end and wall in the same manner.  add the roof crackers in the same manner as the wall crackers, but pipe the icing on the flat of the roof, not on the edges.  line the roof with icing where you want to add shingles.  ,  add the shingles using your chosen candies.  use your imagination and decorate the entire house whatever way you like. 

 Fill a medium stockpot with 2 inches (5 cm) of water. Set the pan on the stove over medium-high heat and bring the water to a steady simmer.   Make sure that the steamer basket fits inside the mouth of the stockpot. The basket should be able to rest over the lip of the pan without touching the bottom of the pot.  Place the baby corn in the steamer basket, then set the steamer basket on top of the stockpot and over the simmering water.   Try to arrange the baby corn cobs into an even layer to promote even cooking.  Cover the steamer and stockpot with an appropriate lid. Steam the baby corn until it becomes slightly tender.Check for doneness by piercing the corn with a fork. It should be easy to pierce, but it should still retain some crispness. Past the “tender crisp” stage, baby corn can become soggy and unpleasant.  Remove the baby corn from the heat and serve it while it's still hot.   Consider serving the baby corn with butter or a drizzle of olive oil. Store leftovers in an airtight container in your refrigerator. Use within one or two days.  

simmer the water.  place the baby corn in the steamer.  cook for 3 to 6 minutes.  serve. 

 Old Spice White Water is a great, spicy scent. It's not that easy to find, but you can probably search on eBay.; , Ralph Lauren Polo is sweet smelling but has a bit to it at the end of the spray. It's great for going out to dinner or a walk around town. Because of the luxury, it's pretty expensive.  Ferrari Black is a great example because it's a scent for all ages, including teenagers. It's also great for outings to the movies, but not clubbing since it doesn't work well with sweat.  Try Nautica Blue for its light, clean smell. It's also very inexpensive and a good buy for the cologne.  Jake is a brand mainly targeted towards teenagers and young adults because of its tropical smell (with a hint of sandalwood).

 From the apps drawer or home screen, look for Google Play Store’s icon, which looks like a shopping bag sporting a colored Play button, and tap on it.; , Do so by typing “SoundHound” in Google Play Store’s search bar, which is a text field that says “Search Google Play” found at the upper right section of the screen. Afterwards, tap on the magnifying-glass icon to launch the search.  You will see SoundHound at the top of this list. Just tap on it to select it.  Tap on the green “Install” button on the right side of the SoundHound app page. A small pop-up window will then appear asking you to grant the app all the necessary permissions for it to run. Tap on the “Accept” button if you are amenable.   Wait more or less one minute for SoundHound to download and be automatically installed. A “Successfully installed” message will then appear on your screen once SoundHound is ready. The app icon will then show both on your device’s home screen and apps menu.  Tap on SoundHound’s app icon either from the home screen or app drawer to launch and open the app interface.   To use SoundHound, make sure your Internet data or Wi-Fi connection is switched on.  Once SoundHound is open, an orange rectangular button with “What’s That Song?” and “Tap Here” written on it will appear on your Android screen. Tap on it.  Once you see “Listening” displayed on your device’s screen, it means SoundHound can now detect sound and is ready to identify music. Hold your Android device towards the music or song you want to identify. Within seconds, you will see the name of the track, its singer, movie/album, and other such information on your Android screen.   If SoundHound fails to recognize the song and comes back with an error message, just click on the orange “Search Again” button. It might help if you get closer to the source of the music.       If you happen to suddenly remember lines to a song, you can belt it out, and there is a big chance SoundHound will recognize it.        

launch google play store.  search for soundhound.  select soundhound from the search results.  download the app.  open soundhound when you hear a song you wish to identify.  tap on the “what’s that song?” button.  let soundhound “hear” the music. 

 Add 1 cup (200 g) of sugar, the finely grated zest from one orange, ¼ teaspoon (1 ½ g) of kosher salt, 2 cups (473 ml) of freshly squeezed orange juice, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of lemon juice, and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract to the bowl of a food processor. Process the mixture for 1 minute, or until the sugar dissolves.If you don’t have a food processor, you can use a blender to mix the ingredients. You’ll need approximately approximately 2 pounds (907 g) of oranges to get the juice that you need.; , After you’ve mixed the ingredients in the food processor, pour the mixture into a large bowl. Add 1 ½ cups (355 ml) of very cold whole milk to the bowl, and use a whisk to blend all of the ingredients together.It’s a good idea to chill the bowl that you’re mixing the sherbet in for 20 to 30 minutes in the refrigerator. To make creamy sherbet, you must use whole milk. You can substitute half and half, though, if you want your sherbet to even creamier. Make sure that the milk is chilled when you mix it into the other ingredients.  Once the sherbet ingredients are mixed, cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Place the bowl in the refrigerator, and chill it for at least 1 hour, or until the mixture reaches 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) or below.If you want to prepare the sherbet mixture the day before, you can refrigerate it overnight.  When the sherbet mixture is cool enough, transfer it to your ice cream maker. Mix it according to the manufacturer’s instructions so the sherbet has the consistency of soft serve ice cream.If you don't have an ice cream maker, pour the mixture into a freezer-safe container and freeze it for approximately 6 to 8 hours, stirring every hour to achieve the soft serve texture.  After the sherbet has reached soft serve consistency, transfer it to a freezer-safe container. Cover it with the lid or plastic wrap, and freeze it until it is firm enough to scoop, which should take approximately 3 hours.The recipe will make approximately 1 quart (946 ml) of orange sherbet. A metal loaf pan works well as a freezer-safe container for the sherbet.  

combine all of the ingredients except the milk in a food processor.  transfer the mixture to a bowl and add the milk.  chill the mixture for an hour.  process the mixture in an ice cream maker.  transfer the sherbet to a freezer-safe container and freeze until firm. 

 The best way to avoid getting hit is by avoiding a fight entirely. Try to calm the guy down. Swallow your pride and apologize if you unknowingly did something that offended your attacker. While apologizing or calming the guy down, try to keep a look of confidence about you. Confidence can be intimidating.  Don't look away even for a second--the one moment you look away may be the moment that he decides to go in for a punch. Instead, follow his movements with your eyes. Use your peripheral vision to keep track of where you are in the space that you are fighting in--you wouldn't want to trip over something.  If he has to stretch to hit you, chances are he won't take that challenge. Instead, keep a bit of space between you and your opponent so that you can determine when you want to go in for a punch. By controlling the distance between you, you can begin to control the fight.  Whether or not you are the one who instigated this fight, you will have to participate if it is in self-defense. An important part of avoiding getting hit is staying as alert as possible during the fight. Do not let yourself get distracted.  You may be able to win the fight without ever having to throw a punch (or taking one). Simply keep moving, forcing your opponent to really work to keep up with you. Chances are, if you are really determined, you will wear your opponent out before he has a chance to attack.  If you can't get out of the fight and it doesn't seem like your opponent is going to let up, you might consider going on the attack. This could be a punch or, if you are defending yourself, an end-it move like a kick or knee to the groin.  Whether this means tiring your opponent out, going in for a big hit, or simply walking away, you will need to end the fight. Assess your situation and choose the best option.  

try to diffuse the situation.  keep a close eye on your opponent's movements.  keep a bit of distance between yourself and your opponent.  do not let your guard down.  tire your opponent out.  go on the attack.  finish the fight. 

 The formula is δx=x0−xx{\displaystyle \delta x={\frac {x_{0}-x}{x}}}, where δx{\displaystyle \delta x} equals the relative error (the ratio of the absolute error to the actual value), x0{\displaystyle x_{0}} equals the measured value, and x{\displaystyle x} equals the actual value., This will likely be a decimal. Make sure you substitute it for δx{\displaystyle \delta x}.  For example, if you know that the relative error is .025, your formula will look like this: .025=x0−xx{\displaystyle .025={\frac {x_{0}-x}{x}}}.  This information should be given to you. Make sure you substitute this value for x{\displaystyle x}.  For example, if you know that the actual value is 360 ft, your formula will look like this: .025=x0−360360{\displaystyle .025={\frac {x_{0}-360}{360}}}.  This will cancel out the fraction.  For example:.025=x0−360360{\displaystyle .025={\frac {x_{0}-360}{360}}}.025×360=x0−360360×360{\displaystyle .025\times 360={\frac {x_{0}-360}{360}}\times 360}9=x0−360{\displaystyle 9=x_{0}-360}   , This will give you the value of x0{\displaystyle x_{0}}, giving you the measured value.  For example:9=x0−360{\displaystyle 9=x_{0}-360}9+360=x0−360+360{\displaystyle 9+360=x_{0}-360+360}369=x0{\displaystyle 369=x_{0}}   , Since absolute error is always positive, take the absolute value of this difference, ignoring any negative signs.This will give you the absolute error.  For example, if the measured value is 369 ft, and the actual value is 360 feet, you would subtract 369−360=9{\displaystyle 369-360=9}. So, the absolute error is 9 feet.   

set up the formula for relative error.  plug in the value for the relative error.  plug in the value for the actual value.  multiply each side of the equation by the actual value.  add the actual value to each side of the equation.  subtract the actual value from the measured value.

 Avril's skin usually looks flawless, so buy some foundation and apply it evenly on your face.  No matter which look she's rocking, Avril's famous smokey eye is consistent. Start with your eyeliner. Draw a thick line along the upper lashes with black eyeliner, then do the same thing along your lower lash line, taking it all the way into the inner and outer corners of your eye. You can also add a little "wing" or "cattail" at the edge of the eye.  Put a grey colour all over your eyelid, and then apply black eyeshadow along your outer eyelid.   If you want to, add sparkles, like Avril does on stage.  Use about two coats of volumizing mascara (make sure that your lashes don't clump) on both the upper and lower lashes.  Avril Lavigne uses extremely light pink blush. Dust some blush on the apples of your cheeks.  Because Avril always wants the focus to be on her eyes, she tones down her lip color. She usually wears light, natural colors. Do not go with anything that is too red, unless you want to look like her in the video "Hot".  

apply some foundation.  start to create the smokey eye.  apply your eyeshadow.  top off your eyes with mascara.  put on some blush.  use nude lipstick. 

 90% of the time, people who want to keep a secret diary or journal, end up only writing about twice a month, or just give up at about May. If you can't bring yourself to keep a commitment, wait another year, then you will be older and more sensible.; , You may want to buy one more notebook. Just in case you lost one.  The boring, plain notebook will be your secret diary, and the fancy frilly one will be your decoy.  Some diary keepers like to offer a prize to the person who found it. This makes it more likely for the person to return it. You may want tell a person you trust to keep it safe and not look at it.  Say something like: "Today I got up, lived my day, and went to bed." Write it again and again, and soon people will get bored in reading it and give up.  Or you can just buy a notebook that comes with a lock.  Of course, this is a secret diary, and secrets should be interesting. Even if you can't spot an interesting part of a day straight away, there is always fun in even the most boring of days! Perhaps you want to complain about a strict teacher? Or maybe you want to write about your crush? It's up to you, but you will need to keep to your commitment.  It's natural, and blank pages mean something too! They mean you were feeling very lazy on that day, or you really couldn't find anything interesting about that day (which is almost impossible, but is possible!) and there was no point in writing. If you have found you have seriously forgotten to write a lot, and missed about three months, don't try to write and catch up. If you do, you are not writing your true, present feelings and your diary will no longer be a true diary.  This just shows you don't keep a diary so people won't go looking. If a teacher asks in class: 'Who keeps a diary?', don't raise your hand! Students will look round and will know who's diary to look for.  If you are not enjoying your diary, carry on until the end of the year, but just don't do one next year! Simple as that!  

argue with yourself.  buy two notebooks, a boring, school-type notebook, and a really fancy frilly one with the word "diary" written on at the front.  swap round the two notebooks!,  in your actual diary, stick a printed piece of paper inside saying your name, email and telephone number inside so people know where to give it back if it gets lost.  write some really stupid, boring entries in your decoy.  get a lock and key for your real diary, this stops other people reading it, even though it blends in.  don't forget to write daily.  don't worry if you have missed out a day, week, or even a month!,  frequently make comments like: ' diaries are boring'.  have fun! 

 When assessing the best path to learning the piano, it’s important to first explore your goals for learning the piano and assess your current resources. There are two primary methods of learning piano online: working with an online individual piano instructor, or learning through an instructional website.To find the learning method that works best, ask yourself:   What do you want to get out of your lessons? Are you planning to perform piano pieces for others, to join a performing ensemble, or simply to play on your own? Would you rather work with a human individual or move through website tutorials at your own speed? How much time can you devote to weekly piano lessons?; , Your budget will determine what kind of lessons you can afford, and how frequently you can afford them. Some of the online tutorial sites offer free lessons, while many online instructors charge for their time. Online lessons with an individual piano instructor often cost around $30/month.Also, remember to factor in other costs, such as paying for sheet music and for piano tunings (if you have a physical piano). If you have a very limited budget, consider learning the basics via YouTube. There are many free videos available to learn basic skills, however they are not interactive.  Whether you are inclined to learn to play the piano by video tutorials, written online tutorials, or by working with an online piano instructor, you should evaluate the websites and instructors, and check out multiple options before making a decision. There are a plethora of instructional websites, and it will be well worth your time to evaluate the sites before you commit to one for instruction—especially if the lessons are expensive.When evaluating sites and instructors, consider:   The qualification and skill of the piano instructor, website creator, or lesson-provider. The online technology. If you find a website with poorly made videos or that uses antiquated media players, move on to a better option. The marketing intent of the website. While many websites are designed to effectively instruct piano players, others are purely commercial and only want to sell a product, such as an online subscription or an instruction manual.  

determine what you expect to gain from piano lessons.  determine your budget.  evaluate multiple instruction options. 

 You may have seen a bioelectrical impedance scale at your gym or personal trainer’s office. These scales have electrodes you stand on, and they send gentle electricity through your body to measure your body fat percentage (fat and muscle conduct electricity differently).They are safe and you don’t feel a thing. Simply stand barefoot on the scale and follow the instructions.   Some scales will tell you your LBM directly, though most will probably just determine your body fat percentage. You can purchase one of these scales to use at home to keep track of your body fat percentage over time. This is an easy-to-use method, but is not always very accurate.  Hydrostatic, or underwater, weighing compares your weight on land to your weight while completely submerged in water. A skilled technician can then calculate your body fat percentage. This is a very accurate method, but it can cost between $40-60 on average. Find a research lab or performance center who does underwater weighing near you.A “bod pod” (or air displacement plethysmography machine) is similar to hydrostatic weighing, except it uses air instead of water. It is pretty accurate when testing people who are close to a healthy BMI, though may be less accurate for very lean people.Research your area to find one near you.  A dual-energy x-ray absorpiometry (DEXA) scanner is used like an x-ray – it’s a harmless and very accurate, though probably expensive, procedure. It is usually used to measure bone density and monitor osteoporosis. This is a very accurate option, but you have to see a medical professional that provides DEXA scans. It may also be expensive.Talk to your family doctor for more information.  

use a bioelectrical impedance scale.  pursue hydrostatic weighing.  get a dexa scan. 

 The flesh should be a translucent, white and shiny. It should spring back when you press it. Avoid steaks that look mottled, discolored, or dull.  Halibut is naturally low in fat, so it can dry out quickly during the cooking process. To prevent this, brush both sides with oil or melted butter before cooking halibut. You can also marinate the fish in oil or a flavored prepared marinade for a few hours before you cook it.  Only turn the fish when it is halfway done. This will help keep it from breaking apart and will help ensure even cooking throughout the fillet. Turn the halibut over using a wide spatula or turner to make sure you flip the whole fillet.  The flavor of halibut is delicate and light, so it's important to avoid over-seasoning the fish and losing its natural flavor. Avoid heavy spices or thick sauces. Instead, choose a light sauce or marinade to complement the flavor of the fish.  

choose halibut steaks that are fresh in appearance.  keep the fish moist.  limit how much you handle the fish.  season in moderation.

You can then spray the deterrent on your furniture., Young puppies need constant supervision. To make sure that they are chewing on their toys and not furniture or dangerous items, always watch them while they are chewing or playing.If the puppy starts to chew on something they shouldn’t, interrupt them loudly. Give them their chew toy instead. Praise them if they start chewing the toy. If they keep chewing the furniture, physically remove them from the spot.  It is important that your puppy does not learn to nip you instead of their toys. While it is natural for the puppy to nip, you should discourage this behavior. When the puppy bites, make a loud yelping noise (like “ouch” or “no”). Take your hand away from them, and walk away for a second. Your puppy will begin to learn bite inhibition., You should have a room or area in your home where you can put the puppy when you are not there. This should be a safe area where there is nothing that the puppy can chew or destroy. When you put the puppy in there, place a chew toy or two in with them so that they can chew on it while you’re not home.A laundry room or bathroom might be good for this purpose. You can buy a puppy pen online or in a pet store. You can set up the pen before you leave home and put the puppy inside. If you are crate training your puppy, you may leave them in the crate for short periods of time, although it is better to give them more room if you are gone for the day. 

keep dangerous items out of reach.  spray taste deterrent on your furniture.  supervise the puppy.  walk away if they nip you.  contain the puppy.

 This method is a simpler version of the first set of instructions presented in this article, and applies only in feet and miles.  The formula you will be using is d = 1.2246* SQRT(h)  , (R + h)2 = R2 + d2. Solving for h (making the assumption that R>>h and expressing the radius of the earth in miles, approx. 3959) yields the expression: d = SQRT(2*R*h)  

assume a flat plane or the ocean.  solve for the distance in miles by plugging in your height of eye in feet (h) into the formula.  derive the formula from the pythagorean theorem.

If your website is your business, or at least strongly relates to building your business, consider a pay per click campaign to help attract targeted clients to your website. Develop targets for both the keywords you want to use and the types of customers who would make the best leads. You’ll use this information later, when setting up campaigns. Include social follow buttons on your website. This makes it easier for people to boost your social media presence. Make sure these buttons are in a prominent location, on every page.Provide free tools or services on your website. When you provide useful resources to the clients, you establish your credibility with them. You can add tools for searching properties according to entered criteria, calculating EMI, estimating the value of a home, and selecting an appropriate locality on your site. You can also provide free chat-based consultation to help prospects with any real estate related questions they might have.  With the prevalence of social networks and social media today, it can be crucial to Use Social Media to Market Your Business. There are many ways to use social media to market small business.Focus your social media presence and communications on benefits to the client, instead of features of property. In other words, people buy, sell, or lease property that meets their needs, not property that has certain amenities. Use the social media tools that your clients use. This may include social networking sites, blogs, or microblogging sites, such as:  Facebook Twitter Instagram Pinterest   Utilize different types of content, from text and pictures to audio and video. Clients are more likely to pay attention to your online presence if there is a variety of ways for them to engage. You can even give video tours of your properties.Be active regularly on social media. Having an account is not enough. You have to be present online for your clients to notice you. Schedule regular times, at least once a week, to post new content. Invite friends, family, colleagues, and past clients to like or follow your social media pages, so they can see and share your message. Make sure to keep in mind that people should want to share and “like” your content, as you design it.  Email blasts, where a company's message is sent to a large number of subscribers all at once, is very common. Make sure to get your clients' and potential clients' email addresses. Be careful not to email too much, lest you get marked as spam.   Though research suggests that e-marketing in this way has a small impact, it shows that it does increase real estate business performance.Encourage clients to share your content by adding share buttons to your email. Set up email sign-up forms on your website. Use a subscriber's name and other details from your interactions to give emails that personal touch. This is more difficult to pull off in large email blasts.  Web syndication apps allow you to link your online presence together, and then post your content across multiple online platforms at once or on a schedule. This can be a key way to manage an unwieldy volume of online material.   Share other people's realty-related content. This can help you build professional connections rapidly. People are more likely to give you a social media boost if you give one to them. Put your content in as many places as possible. This provides your potential clients with an array of ways to access your business. Someone visiting your blog might not go to your Facebook page, and so syndication can increase the chances clients see what you create.  

build a website.  utilize social networks/media.  start an email campaign.  syndicate. 

 Obviously, if you don't already have a heater, you may want to consider buying one. Plug-in heating devices, which can usually be found at most department stores, are available in a wide range of sizes and power levels, making them a reasonable solution for any size room (and any budget).   Keep in mind that space heaters tend to use a lot of electricity. While you may be able to make up the difference by turning off your central heating, frequent space heater use can affect your utility bill. Always adhere to the basics of heater safety: don't leave space heaters on unattended (including while you sleep) and don't use space heaters that burn fuel indoors, as these pose a carbon monoxide hazard., Though they were once considered unfashionable, electrical blankets are making a comeback thanks to the comfort (and savings) they provide. The devices can make for an exceptionally comfortable slumber when it's cold in your room. Best of all, they tend to use significantly less energy than other plug-in heaters — one consumer study found that they usually saved about one-half to three-fourths of the energy.For the most comfort, start the electric blanket a few minutes before you get into bed. To save energy, turn it off before you fall asleep.  For some, there's nothing quite as comfortable as the feeling of being under a heavy pile of blankets when it's cold. The more layers of blankets you use, the more of your body heat will be trapped in the bed. Additional layers create pockets of "dead heat" — air that has a hard time leaking out into the surrounding cool.   In general, thicker, fluffier materials (like wool, fleece, and down) are warmest. Air gets caught in the tiny spaces in these materials, trapping more heat next to the body. Don't forget that you can even wear blankets around the house — perfect when you don't want to give up the warm comfort of bed just yet.  Windows are one of the most frequent sources of heat loss for rooms.To counteract this, try hanging thick, heavy curtains around your window and closing them as soon as it starts to get cold in the evening. The heavy material of the curtains will help slow the heat loss through the glass, keeping the room warmer, longer.   If curtains aren't in your budget, you can get a similar effect by hanging old blankets in front of windows.  Smooth, hard surfaces like wood, tile, and marble tend to retain much less heat than carpet. In fact, un-insulated floors can account for 10% of a room's total heat loss.If you're tired of freezing your toes off when you get up in the morning, consider laying down a rug or even having carpeting installed. This will also help keep your room warm once you've heated it — a carpeted room will stay warm longer after you turn off the heater than a room with a bare tile floor.   You can even sometimes get away with covering some of your walls with carpet-like materials to increase this effect. Things like tapestries and decorative rugs can look great when they're hung from the wall and can keep your room slightly warmer at the same time.  Though it's a major investment, getting new insulation in your home can be a project that pays for itself in the long run, as this can dramatically reduce heating bills (especially for older, draftier houses).Another benefit, of course, is that you'll be warmer and more comfortable. Below are a just few types of insulation you may want to consider:   Wall insulation (fiberglass, etc.) Window insulation (double and triple-paned windows, protective films, etc.) Door insulation (draft guards, floor seals, etc.) Every house is different, so the amount of work required can vary wildly from house to house. Before you make any concrete decisions, talk to an experienced contractor (or several) and get an estimate for your project so you can determine what the best decision for you is  

get a space heater for your room.  get an electrical blanket for your bed.  get more blankets.  get thicker curtains.  cover bare floors (and walls.),  invest in better insulation.

 The U.S. International Trade Commission publishes the HTS, which is available online for download in PDF format. The tariff rates listed apply to imports into the United States, but you can use it to find the appropriate classification number for your product.The entire HTS is huge – the size of an unabridged dictionary – but the online version allows you to browse the table of contents and click on specific chapters that apply to broad categories of products. Keep in mind that very specific details about your product may go into its classification, such as its design, where its parts come from, and the identity of your customer (whether you're selling to individual customers or to businesses). Through browsing the HTS, you may be able to find several possible classification numbers. In that case, it could take additional research to determine exactly which number applies to your product. Labeling your product with the wrong Schedule B number could result in additional tariffs or penalties, so it's important to make sure you have the correct number. Your Schedule B number also must be included on import and export documents required for shipping your product, and certificates of origin associated with your product.; , The Census Bureau hosts a search engine on its website that can help you find the classification number for your product. You can use the database to search for specific words or phrases, or to browse the entire Schedule B book.To find the search engine on the Bureau's website, click on the "Business & Industry" topic heading, then click on the "Foreign Trade" subcategory to navigate to Schedule B. The Schedule B search engine allows you to use various key words to find a possible Schedule B number, but it's important to understand that it will only produce results based on the words you enter, not close or similar results. As a result, if you use the wrong words you may end up with the wrong classification number. Browsing the section that corresponds to the classification can help you confirm that the number you've isolated is the correct one you should use to classify your product.  Both the Census Bureau and the government website export.gov have a number of instructional videos, webinars, and other online tools that you can use to learn more about the classification process.Export.gov has a webinar that not only walks you through finding the correct Schedule B number for your product, but using searchable online databases to find the applicable tariff rate for your product in the country where you want to sell it. You also can find an instructional video on the Census Bureau's website that explains how to use the Bureau's online tools to find the classification number you need. In addition to the video, the Bureau's website includes a number of informational articles and "how to" guides related to various foreign trade issues. Export.gov also has a number of informational articles and FAQs about foreign trade and international tariffs, including links to definitions and descriptions on other government and third-party websites.  If you still have questions or concerns about the classification of your product after using the online tools and resources, you may want to speak with a commodity classification expert.U.S. classification experts are available by phone at 1-800-549-0595. Select menu option "2" to speak with an expert. You can describe your product and the expert will help you identify the correct Schedule B number. Classification experts also are available via email at the address ftb.scheduleb@census.gov.  The first six digits of the Schedule B number associated with your product are the Harmonized System (HS) number used internationally to classify your product. The customs info database provides tariff rates for each HS number.You can use your Schedule B number to determine whether your product is eligible for reduced tariff rates under a free trade agreement. While the U.S. government does not provide a database of all foreign tariffs, you can search online using the third-party information provider Customs Info. To use the database, you must register with the service by providing a valid email address. After registration, the service is free to use. Customs Info provides tariff and tax rates for shipments from the U.S. to more than 120 countries around the world. Once you register and confirm your email address, you're ready to search. You will need to enter the country where you plan to ship your product and the HS number associated with your product. When your search result appears, click the applicable button to calculate tariffs and taxes associated with your product.  If you have a shipper, freight forwarder, or customs broker, they also may be able to help you determine the applicable tariff rate for your product. Shippers may have additional information for tariffs in countries not listed in the customs info database.If you don't already have a shipper, you may want to contact an international shipping company such as UPS, FedEx, or DHL. Contacting several companies can allow you to compare rates and services and choose the best shipper for your business needs. If you're shipping to some parts of the world, it may be beneficial to contract with a customs broker or freight forwarder. You can find an appropriate broker or other vendor by searching on the websites of the Shippers Association, the National Customs Brokers and Freight Forwarders Association, or similar organizations.  Many countries also have tariff databases available online that you can search to find the tariff rate associated with the product you want to ship there. These databases typically are free to use, although some may require registration.Export.gov has a list of links to some of the most commonly used databases, including the tariff schedules for Canada, China, and the European Union. When you're evaluating these schedules, make sure you're looking at the tariffs associated with products that are imported into that country. It can be easy to get confused and read the wrong schedule, but if you're looking at tariff rates in the destination country, your product is an import from that country's perspective – even though from your perspective it's an export. Various trade unions such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) also have websites with tariff information applicable to member countries.  Once you have the tariff rate, you're able to determine the international tariff cost based on the amount of product you intend to export. At the same time, you should include any additional customs fees, licensing, or certification the destination country requires.The tariff rate typically is based on a certain weight of product or number of units. Make sure you measure weight accurately, typically using the metric system, so you can calculate the tariffs you'll owe at customs. Some countries also may have varying tariff rates depending on the total amount of the product you import, or the frequency of shipments. If you were able to use the Customs Info database, your search results would include all national and local taxes for your product. However, keep in mind that if you were looking directly at the country's tariff schedule to determine the applicable tariff rate, additional sales and other taxes typically are not included. Depending on the type of product you want to export, there also may be testing or inspection fees.  The cost to ship your product to a country overseas includes your domestic freight charges to get the product to the appropriate port, as well as ocean freight and insurance.Some shippers include required insurance in the price they quote you for transporting your products, while others may require you to purchase it separately. Keep in mind that if the tariff is based on the value rather than the weight of the product, the cost of insurance typically is included in that value for the purposes of calculating the tariff.  The final or suggested consumer price of your product overseas is the factory price plus all the costs for tariffs, other taxes, shipping, insurance, and any additional charges by importers, distributors, or marketers in the destination country.Keep in mind that setting a correct price may be one of the most difficult aspects of this exercise, and even experienced exporters sometimes get it wrong. Your international tariff costs are only a small piece of the pricing puzzle. While you can't do much to change the total costs of exporting your product, if there's little to no demand for your product in your target country, it will just sit on the shelves and your buyers will be unlikely to purchase more. Apart from overall shipping costs and the wholesale factory price of your product, you must determine what the retail markup will be. If your product is too expensive, you won't have many sales – particularly if there's already a domestic product on the market that has a lower price tag. You can commission industry and marketplace studies from experts to better understand your product's potential in foreign markets. You also can do much of this research on your own for some, more common products. For example, suppose you make bicycles. You know that in parts of Southeast Asia, bicycles are the primary form of transportation for most people, and that very few people own cars. You want to sell your bicycles in those areas. You know the demand is there, but whether that demand would translate into a demand for your particular product depends on many factors such as the prices of bicycles that are already on the market, what your bikes have that those domestic bikes don't, and how often and for what reasons consumers in those areas purchase new bikes. All of these factors – and more – will go into your calculation of the base price of your product. The sheer number of variables that must be considered leaves plenty of room for error. The buyer with whom you plan to work may be able to give you some guidance on the local market that can help you reach a fair and more reliable number.  After you've totaled the cost per unit of your product, you're ready to create a price estimate for overseas buyers, which typically is communicated using a pro forma invoice.A pro forma invoice form is available on export.gov for you to download and use to quote an estimate to your international buyers. Your quotation not only includes the price of the product, but provides a method and proposed dates for shipping. You also should include the terms of sale and method of payment, including any amounts required in advance.  

check the harmonized tariff schedule (hts).  use the census bureau's search engine.  watch instructional videos.  seek additional assistance.  check the customs info database.  work with your shipper.  search public tariff resources.  total tariff costs and customs fees.  factor in the cost of shipping.  set the base price of your product.  quote an estimate. 

 Get out a medium mixing bowl and measure 1 cup (120 g) of white cornmeal and 3/4 teaspoon of salt into it. Use a whisk or a fork to stir the cornmeal and salt together., Bring 1 cup (236 ml) of water to boil. Slowly pour the water into the bowl of cornmeal while you stir it. Keep stirring the mushy cornmeal.You can heat the water in a pan on the stove or use a water kettle.  Slowly pour 1/2 cup (120 ml) of milk into the cornmeal mixture and stir it well. Set the batter aside while you heat a heavy skillet over medium heat. Grease the skillet with bacon drippings or shortening.The batter should be pretty thick, since there isn't very much liquid in it. You don't need to heat the milk before you add it.  Once the skillet is hot, scoop a spoonful of batter and drop it into the pan. Press down on each johnnycake, so they flatten to 1/4-inch (6 mm) thick. Flip them over with a spatula once they're golden brown on each side.You can probably fry half a dozen johnnycakes at a time. If they begin to stick to the skillet, spread more bacon drippings on the pan.  Fry the rest of the New England johnnycakes in batches. Set them on a serving plate and serve them with:Butter Maple syrup Applesauce  

combine the cornmeal and salt.  pour hot water into the bowl of cornmeal.  stir in the milk and heat the pan.  fry several spoonfuls of johnnycake batter.  finish frying the johnnycakes and serve them.

 Add your apple cider vinegar, ground mustard, salt, and aquafaba to a small bowl. Blend them together with an immersion blender until they’re evenly mixed. This should only take a second or two., Once the other ingredients are mixed, keep the immersion blender running. Very slowly pour in ¼ cup (59 ml) of your oil while mixing it in with blender as you pour. The oil will cause the mixture to thicken, which means you’ll have to move the blender around more and more to cover it all, so pause between each ¼ cup to blend and judge the mixture’s consistency before repeating.You only need enough oil to thicken the mixture so it isn’t runny. If it doesn’t drip or pour off the blender when you remove it after the third 1/4 cup, stop there. If it still appears running, add another 1/4 cup.  Pour the mixture into a jar with an airtight seal. Place the jar in the refrigerator. Give it a few hours to thicken, until it reaches the consistency of real mayo. Once it does, use it as a spread for sandwiches, a dip for french fries, or as needed in any recipe that calls for mayo.Once a can of chickpeas is opened, the aquafaba will last for one week when refrigerated, so adjust the recipe's proportions if needed to make an amount you're likely to use up in that time. 

blend together all but the oil.  add the oil.  refrigerate. 

 Cream blushes don't have to contain dangerous chemicals. By making your own cream blush, you get to decide exactly what goes into it—and you can customize the color too. This section will teach you how to make your own cream blush. You can apply it using your fingers or makeup sponge.  Fill the bottom pot with an inch or two of water and place the upper pot on top. Transfer everything to the stove and turn the stove on to a medium heat.   If you do not have a double boiler, then you can make your own by filling a large pot with an inch or two of water, and placing a large bowl over it. The bottom of the bowl should not touch the water.  You will need 1 teaspoon of shea butter and ½ teaspoon of emulsifying wax. Place both ingredients into the upper pot or bowl of your double boiler.  Heat the two ingredients until they melt. Be sure to stir them while they are melting with a spoon or spatula. This helps the butter and wax melt more evenly, and it mixes them together.  Once the shea butter and emulsifying wax have melted completely, turn the stove off and move the double boiler to a heat-resistant surface. The mixture in the pot should look translucent, and there should be no clumps.  Once the mixture has cooled slightly, measure out 1 tablespoon of aloe gel and transfer it to the mixture. Blend everything together with a spoon or spatula. Try to use a clear aloe gel, as opposed to a tinted one.  Add both your mica and cocoa powders a little bit at a time until you get the color you want. You can use any color of mica powders you want, but pinks and reds might yield the best and most natural results. The cocoa powders will help darken the blush. If you wish to have a lighter blush, then use less cocoa. You will need ½ to 1 teaspoon of each powder, depending on your preferences.   Consider dipping a spoon into the mixture, letting it cool, and holding it against your cheek to make sure you have the right color.  Once you have achieved the color you want, transfer everything into a small, seal-able jar using a spoon or spatula. Leave the jar in a cool place, unopened, until it has solidified, then seal the jar tightly with a lid.   Wait 24 hours before using the blush. This allows it to solidify., You can leave your container as is, or you can personalize it further by adding a personalized label or embellishing it with stick-on gems.  

consider making a cream blush.  assemble your double boiler.  measure out the shea butter and emulsifying wax and put it the a double boiler.  melt shea butter and wax in a double boiler.  remove the double boiler from the stove.  add aloe and mix until smooth.  add mica and cocoa powders a little bit at a time.  transfer everything into a little jar and let it solidify.  consider decorating your container.

 In order to buy collard greens, you need to know what you are looking for. Collard greens are large in size, usually at least 10 to 12 inches long, with oval, flat leaves.In comparison to kale, the leaves are usually wider and the stems are thicker.If you are unsure about which greens in your store are collard greens, look for signage to indicate or markings on the ties that keep bunches of collards together. You can also feel free to ask someone who works there.; , Many grocery stores will carry collard greens on a regular basis in the produce section, close to other greens, such as kale or Swiss chard. They should be located in a chilled area, which will keep them firm.   Look for the freshest collards to show up in your store in winter through spring. They will also be at their lowest price during these times of year., If you can't find collard greens in your normal grocery store, you may need to go to a specialty store. Stores that cater to African Americans are likely to carry collard greens, as they have an important place in African American food culture.There are other cultures that use collard greens in their cooking. Collards can be found in dishes all across the globe, from Ethiopia to Portugal, so they may be available in a wide variety of specialty stores., The leaves of collard greens should be a very dark green. However, the leaves will have light colored veins and stems.   The leaves of collard greens can have almost a waxy finish, which is a natural way they deter insects., Good collard greens are firm and crisp.Firmness will show you that the collard greens are relatively fresh and that they have been stored properly in the store, as well as while being transported from the field to the store.   Pick up the greens and bend them a little bit. They should be firm and not floppy.  Discoloration is a sign that the collard greens are past their prime. Even though you may be stewing the greens, buying collard greens that are discolored will result in a sub-par finished product.   In a bunch of collard greens there may be one or two leaves that were slightly damaged and thus are a bit discolored. It's also not uncommon to have a few holes in collard greens due to hungry bugs. If the majority of the leaves look good, however, then the collards are probably just fine to purchase., Once you purchase the collard greens, you will want to store them in a plastic bag in your refrigerator. This keeps them nice and firm, as the plastic bag prevents dehydration.Do not wash the collard greens before you put them in the refrigerator. This will promote decay.  Collard greens are known for being relatively dirty and gritty when they are harvested. Because of this, you will need to clean them thoroughly before cooking them. To do this, soak then in a sink full of water and rub them vigorously to remove any dirt and debris.Don't just neglect looking at each individual leaf. Make sure each individual leaf is cleaned or you may end up with dirt and girt in your meal.  There are a variety of ways that you can use collard greens, but most traditionally they are stewed or boiled in water with a piece of bacon, ham hock, or pork and some salt.This process takes quite awhile, some recipes state upwards of two hours, so that the collards become nice and silky and so that they take on the flavor of the pork.   Before you cook the greens you will need to cut them into smaller pieces. Remove the stems from the center of the leaves. Then roll up the remaining leaf pieces and cut them into one inch wide ribbons.There is a wide variety of other ways you can use collard greens.To begin experimenting with them in your cooking remember that any way you would use cabbage or other greens, such as kale, in a recipe, you can use collard greens instead.  

identify collard greens.  look in the produce section.  go to a specialty store.  look for dark green colored leaves.  assess the firmness.  avoid signs of browning or yellowness.  keep your collard greens fresh.  wash the greens thoroughly.  cook the collard greens.

 Your preferences can change frequently, so why would your choice in partners be any different? If you’re surprised by who you’re attracted to, consider the many factors that may be in play. For example, you may be attracted to their pheromones or feel connected in a strong intellectual way rather than physical way.If you notice your tastes changing or that you’re surprised in who you’re attracted to, accept these changes and don’t fight against them.; , Perhaps you’re drawn to someone new because what has worked before isn’t working now. For example, the kind of partner you were interested in during college may not be the kind of person you’re interested in now in your 30’s. Be open to exploring it and surprising yourself. It may open up new parts of yourself that you’ve never discovered before.Don’t immediately shrug off the attraction you feel. Be open to exploring.  If you find yourself attracted to someone who might actually be good for you (for once), see what has changed for you. Perhaps you’ve matured and want a better fit. You may have gained clarity on something in your own life, which has extended to making different decisions for your romantic relationships.   For example, if you’ve been drawn to powerful men in the past yet it’s consistently ended badly, you may have learned to empower yourself. Now, you might want a man who is more balanced with you. Give yourself some credit for the growth you have made.  You might be attracted to someone because they are different. Think about the positive things that make them different from other people you’ve been interested in. Perhaps this person shows more love and respect than you’ve experienced before. They might show support in a way that you’ve never known. Think about the positive things they bring that may be attractive to you.For example, notice if they’re patient and calm, even if you don’t feel patient and calm.  If you find yourself attracted to someone who doesn’t fit your type based on looks, be open to experiencing attraction in different ways. You might be more attracted to this person for who they are and less for how they appear.Attraction can happen on many fronts. If you’re less physically attracted to someone yet still feel attraction toward them, it might be their charisma, intellect, or relatability.  Attraction to someone goes beyond physical sex appeal. While you may not feel immediately attracted to someone by their looks, you might find that you become emotionally or intellectually attracted to them. As you build a connection, you might begin to feel more sexually attracted to them, even if it wasn’t there at first. Focus on what you desire about the person and allow that to unfold.If you’re surprised by your attraction to someone, see where it goes. It might lead to more attraction to them overall.  While someone might look different from others you’ve dated, they might have similar qualities or personalities. For example, if you tend to date people who are controlling, they might be controlling in different ways, but are still controlling. Stay clear of people who exhibit signs of bad patterns from your past.For example, you may have dated materialistic people who had fancy cars. If you find someone new who doesn’t have fancy cars but spends lots of money on their appearance and clothes, you still like a materialistic person, it just looks different.  If you’re attracted to someone then realize that they trigger some old habits, take note. For example, if you’ve just quit smoking then meet someone you’re attracted to who smokes, question your attraction to them. You might just want an excuse to justify your behavior to go back to smoking.   For example, if you’re an alcoholic, you might be attracted to other people who also drink in excess, even if they are very different from you. Notice if your attraction is based on something that might be harmful to you.  If you find that you’re attracted to someone you know is trouble, stay away. It’s one thing to be attracted to someone, yet it’s another to act on the attraction. If you know someone is violent, dramatic, or a bad partner, acknowledge your attraction but stay far away. Some warning signs to look out for include possessiveness, mood swings, pressuring you to do things, and explosive anger.Don’t involve yourself with someone you consider dangerous or violent.  If you find yourself always choosing the ‘wrong’ people in your love life, consider seeing a therapist. You may gain some insight as to why you’re attracted to people that are not ultimately good for you. If you’ve experienced trauma in the past and bring that to relationships, therapy can help you work through the trauma and move on with your life.Therapy can help you learn more about yourself and your patterns. Then, you can begin to create more positive patterns for your life.  If you’re surprised and wonder why you’re attracted to someone, ask yourself if they fit in with the kind of person you want right now. For example, if you’re newly single and want to flirt with new people, you might be interested in people who flirt back or show an interest in you. Depending on what you want, act accordingly.If you want a fling and someone is available, then you might want to go for it. However, if you want a committed relationship and the person wants a fling, this ultimately does not align with what you want.  If you tend to date people who are not a good fit for you, try to initiate something with this person. If it doesn’t feel natural at first, that’s okay. Give it a shot and see what happens. If you’re trying to break bad patterns, give someone who doesn’t fit your type a chance.Give yourself some time to adjust. Dating someone entirely new might feel uncomfortable at first, but give it a real chance to see if it might work well.  Don’t just pursue someone because you want to see if you’re capable of liking them. Don’t lead someone on or play with their emotions, especially if their feelings are involved. It’s okay to try new things and date different people. However, if you know you are not emotionally invested, be honest with the person and tell them your intentions.   If you’re unsure about dating someone, don’t promise them commitments. Ask for more time in defining the relationship until you know what you want.  

recognize that tastes can change.  be open.  ask yourself if this person is better for you..  examine their positive traits.  focus less on looks.  understand that attraction can grow.  notice bad patterns occurring.  ask yourself if you’re making excuses.  be cautious.  see a therapist.  ask yourself what you want.  try something new.  avoid using someone. 

 This is extremely important for safety and convenience reasons, so don't forget to do it. Put the selector switch in the "OFF" position, and once everything's powered down, go ahead and expose the hinge pins on the refrigerator's ice door by sliding the covering bracket aside. Take out the pins–– there ought to be one or two on either side of the bracket––and put them somewhere out of the way, but don't lose them.  That screw you just removed also secured the harness in the back of the unit, so remove that too. The only thing that should be left by now is a set of locking tabs. These tabs sit on each side of the ice-maker and hold it in place. Use your flat-bladed screwdriver to press them out of locking position, then slide the ice-maker toward you.  You should be able to see a wire harness coming out of the back of the ice-maker. If not, just slide it forward some more. Making sure to keep the infrared door shut, pull the tab on the side of the harness and disconnect it. Pull the ice-maker out, and put it on a clean, level surface. It's time to swap out the base of your old ice-maker so that you can put it on the new one., This will make it easier to remove the bottom assembly. Remove the three hex screws with your hex screwdriver, push in the two tabs attaching the wire harness connector to the end of the base assembly until the harness falls out, and discard the rest of your old ice-maker. You won't need it any more. As always, make sure to keep any screws you've removed some place close at hand.  Line up the holes for the screws and screw everything down nice and tightly. Put the harness connector through the hole the old one fell out of, and once the tab on the end of it is clearly visible, lock everything in place. Now it is time to put your new ice-maker into the fridge!, Make sure that it locks in. Next, line the ice-maker up so that it slides on the grooves on each side of the open cavity in front of you. Slide the ice-maker backward until you hear a snap––that's the sound of the locking tabs engaging. Now it's time to reinstall the wire harness cover. Just run it up the back and over the top of the harness itself, and then screw in the 1/4" hex screw that holds it in place. To re-install the door of the ice-maker, engage one hinge pin, and once it's back in the bracket where it belongs, put in the other one (bend out the tab if you have to, but be careful; you don't want it to break!).  Your icemaker is now brand-new and ready to use. Turn the power switch from "OFF" to "ON", and make yourself a well-earned drink! You've just replaced your ice-maker. 

make sure that the ice-maker is turned off.  remove the quarter-inch hex screw on the right side of the ice tray and pull the shelf out.  find the wire harness.  flip the ice-maker upside down.  put the bottom assembly you just took off onto your new ice-maker.  stand your newly assembled ice machine on end, so that you can connect the wire harness.  done. 

 This type of living isn't for everyone, and you'll need to rely on survival instincts to make it each day.; , Since you simply cannot run to a shower house, flip on ESPN or hit the gym, you must mentally prepare yourself for life away from civilization. This means you'll need to learn food growing, basic survivalist skills and mentally training yourself to live with literally nothing more than what you choose to bring.  The new paradigm in primitive living is to plan ahead, unlike the days when you had a Swiss Army knife and some clothes. Several items would come in handy should you wish to remain technologically engaged with society: a small or medium solar panel charger, small rainwater collection kit (water stowage), a tent large enough to stand and not feel cramped up in, a means to cook food, at least two weeks worth of easy-to-carry rations and either a consistent financial source, or the skills to barter. Remember––you'll be living outside of a city that is relatively small and without much work.  Niland sits on California Highway 111, which runs near Interstate 10. You can also take the Route 86 South exit off I-10 as 86 joins 111 near Mecca, CA. From Niland, take Main Street until it joins Beal Road; once you pass Salvation Mountain, you're just around the corner from The Slabs.  The area is considered 'deserted territory' by the United States government;however, those living there have set up their own camps, so find space that is a comfortable distance from your nearby neighbor. Many 'courtesy' rules exist at The Slabs, such as allowing perennial RVers the courtesy to have the same spot, although these rules are not enforced since they, essentially, cannot be enforced because nobody owns the land.  If driving, you'll probably want to set up camp near your vehicle to allow others the opportunity to have space; if walking, perhaps 'mark' your territory with a flag, stick sign or something similar. Set up your tent, prepare your bedding, then start mingling with the locals, in order to learn more about The Slabs and their 'community courtesy rules'.  Many kind folks may have rations to give or loan from time to time, yet it's ultimately your responsibility to feed, water and bathe yourself. Ask if different outposts have been created to help people learn about survival. Again, The Slabs are not governed by any specific body, and nobody can do more than to ask you to leave their particular campsite.  If you can hitch a ride with someone to town every couple of weeks to gather rations or water, take the opportunity to do so. If hitchhiking back and forth, you should only carry what you can, and maybe make several trips each week.  Although most individuals are down to earth, rude and disruptive individuals are dealt with, most of the time not very kindly.  

gauge your personal comfort level before heading to slab city.  prepare for a primitive lifestyle.  plan ahead.  find your way there.  once you arrive, find space.  get situated.  learn about surviving.  plan trips to niland sparingly.  keep a level head and kind demeanor while living at the slabs.

 The formula for calculating kinetic energy (KE) is KE = 0.5 x mv2. Here m stands for mass, the measure of how much matter is in an object, and v stands for velocity of the object, or the rate at which the object changes its position.Your answer should always be stated in joules (J), which is the standard unit of measurement for kinetic energy. It is equivalent to 1 kg * m2/s2.; , If you are solving a problem where the mass isn’t given, you will have to determine the mass yourself. This can be done by weighing the object on a balance and obtaining the mass in kilograms (kg).   Tare the balance. Before you weigh your object, you must set it to zero. Zeroing out the scale is called taring.Place your object on the balance. Gently, place the object on the balance and record its mass in kilograms. If necessary, convert grams to kilograms. For the final calculation, the mass must be in kilograms.  Oftentimes, the problem will give you the velocity of the object. If this is not the case, you can determine the velocity by using the distance an object travels and how long it takes to cover that distance.The units for velocity are meters per second (m/s).   Velocity is defined by the equation, displacement divided by time: V = d/t. Velocity is a vector quantity, meaning it has both a magnitude and a direction. Magnitude is the number value that quantifies the speed, while direction is the direction in which the speed takes place during motion. For example, an object’s velocity can be 80 m/s or -80 m/s depending on the direction of travel. To calculate velocity, simply divide the distance the object traveled by the time it took to travel that distance.  The formula for calculating kinetic energy (KE) is KE = 0.5 x mv2. Here m stands for mass, the measure of how much matter is in an object, and v stands for velocity of the object, or the rate at which the object changes its position.Your answer should always be stated in joules (J), which is the standard unit of measurement for kinetic energy. It is equivalent to 1 kg * m2/s2.  If you don't know the mass or velocity of the object, then you'll have to calculate it. But let's say that you do know both quantities and are working to solve the following problem: Determine the kinetic energy of a 55 kg woman running with a velocity of 3.87m/s. Since you know the mass and velocity of the woman, you can plug it into the equation:KE = 0.5 x mv2 KE = 0.5 x 55 x (3.87)2  , Once you've plugged in the mass and velocity, you can solve for kinetic energy (KE). Square the velocity and then multiply all of the variables together. Remember to state your answer in joules (J). KE = 0.5 x 55 x (3.87)2 KE = 0.5 x 55 x 14.97 KE = 411.675 J  , The formula for calculating kinetic energy (KE) is KE = 0.5 x mv2. Here m stands for mass, the measure of how much matter is in an object, and v stands for velocity of the object, or the rate at which the object changes its position.Your answer should always be stated in joules (J), which is the standard unit of measurement for kinetic energy. It is equivalent to 1 kg * m2/s2.  In some problems, you may know the kinetic energy and the mass or kinetic energy and velocity. The first step to solving this problem is to plug in all of the variables that are known.   Example 1: What is the velocity of an object with a mass of 30 kg and a kinetic energy of 500 J?  KE = 0.5 x mv2 500 J = 0.5 x 30 x v2   Example 2: What is the mass of an object with a kinetic energy of 100 J and a velocity of 5 m/s?  KE = 0.5 x mv2 100 J = 0.5 x m x 52    , Using algebra, you can solve for the unknown variable by rearranging all of the known variables to one side of the equation.   Example 1: What is the velocity of an object with a mass of 30 kg and a kinetic energy of 500 J?  KE = 0.5 x mv2 500 J = 0.5 x 30 x v2 Multiply mass by 0.5: 0.5 x 30 = 15 Divide kinetic energy by the product: 500/15 = 33.33 Square root to find velocity: 5.77 m/s   Example 2: What is the mass of an object with a kinetic energy of 100 J and a velocity of 5 m/s?  KE = 0.5 x mv2 100 J = 0.5 x m x 52 Square the velocity: 52 = 25 Multiply by 0.5: 0.5 x 25 = 12.5 Divide kinetic energy by product: 100/12.5 = 8 kg    

know the formula for calculating kinetic energy.  determine the mass of an object.  calculate the velocity of the object.  write the equation.  plug the mass and velocity into the equation.  solve the equation.  write the equation.  plug in the known variables.  rearrange the equation to solve for the unknown variable. 

 Boil 2 ears of corn for 2 to 5 minutes, or until tender. Rinse the corn under cold water and place the ears of corn on a clean cutting surface. Stand each ear, 1 at a time, on end and shave all of the kernels off of the cob using a chef's knife. Set the corn kernels aside.; , Take approximately half of a bunch of cilantro and separate the stems from the individual leaves. Place the cilantro leaves in a tight pile near the center of your cutting surface, chop roughly and set aside.  Remove the core from 1 tomato and, on a flat, clean cutting surface, use a chef's knife to cut the tomato into small pieces. The cut tomato pieces should be approximately the size of the nail on your pinky finger.  Finely chop 4 tbsp. of onion on a clean, dry cutting surface and set aside.  Finely dice 3 chilies, retaining the seeds to add to the fresh corn salsa.  Using a pairing knife, cut 1 lime in half through the middle of the stem. With the flat side facing down, cut each half of the lime in half again through the center of the stem cavity and. Set the limes aside.  Combine the lime, cilantro, corn kernels, chopped onion and chilies in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Squeeze the juice from the lime wedges into the mixing bowl and add 1/s tsp. of salt. Add more salt as needed, to taste. Your fresh corn salsa is ready to serve. 

prepare the corn kernels.  prepare the cilantro.  cut the tomato.  chop the onion.  dice the serrano chilies.  cut the lime wedges.  mix the ingredients.  finished.  

 Modern diamond cutting is based on the optical calculations and is aimed at creating maximum brilliance as a result of dispersion. Diamond cut consists of the following parts: crown, pavilion and possibly culet. Pavilion depth and angle, crown depth and angle should be perfectly combined to achieve the right refraction of light. To deep or too shallow cutting lets light out of the gem, while its design should reflect the light back and make the diamond sparkle. There are round and fancy shapes of diamonds: pear, marquise\ navette, emerald\octagonal, oval, princess, radiant, heart, trilliant, asscher, cushion, round. Round cut is classical and the most popular. To choose the best shape you should consider fingers length and form. Small and symmetric diamonds look better on small hands with slim fingers, while Marquise and Pear would best fit short fingers.; , A diamond works like a prism dividing incoming light into the spectrum of colors. There is a scale grading diamonds colors from D to Z, with D meaning a perfectly colorless diamond, and Z - noticeable color. Colorless diamonds marked D – F allow more light to pass through them, thus, they are considered the best and are the most rare and expensive. So, the less color the diamond has the more sparkling flashes (called “fire”) it will produce. Yellow color in a diamond reduces the color spectrum like a filter. Diamonds marked Z are yellowish or even brownish.  Carat is a measure of diamonds weight, which is of course directly proportional to their size. To help you understand the proportions of carats and sizes there are multiple guide charts with relation tables available. They are adjusted for each diamond shape listed above.  Diamond clarity is the quality describing the existence of internal and surface defects of stones. These peculiarities of texture are called inclusions and blemishes. Inclusions are structural imperfections, different in size, color, location, number and visibility. They can be whitish cracks or crystals of foreign materials. There is a clarity grade as well which allows assessing the presence of inclusions identified under ten times magnification.  

look at the cut and shape.  really look at the color.  determine its number of carats.  examine it for its clarity. 

 No matter how excited your child is to start preschool, they also may feel a little nervous or scared. Help them understand preschool by giving them an idea of what it will be like. Tell your child where they will be going, what they will be doing, and what a normal day in preschool might include. Give them a sense of what will happen so that they can feel prepared to start with as little worry as possible.For example, say, “You are going to this building right here. I’ll drop you off at the door and say goodbye, then you’ll go inside and do lots of fun activities. You might sing, dance, color, draw, paint, or play. Then, you’ll have snack time and quiet time. When preschool is over, I’ll come back and pick you up!”; , Some schools have a meet day where children can come and explore their classroom and meet their teacher. Have your child meet the teacher, tour the school, and spend some time on the playground. Point to things around the classroom and show your child where they might sit. Let them look around the classroom and see what activities, games, and toys they can play with at school. This should help them get excited about coming.If your child’s preschool does not have this, they might have a parent-teacher meet day. If so, tell your child about the teacher and the classroom and let them know what kinds of things they can expect. You can also bring your child to the playground and let them play there.  Take turns being the child, teacher, and parent. Practice the roles and do common activities performed in preschool such as saying goodbye in the morning, hanging up a jacket, having circle time, singing songs, and reading stories. Let your child experience the different roles.When role playing, make preschool sound exciting and fun.  A great way to prepare your child for preschool is to read books about preschool. Your child can learn how their favorite characters deal with the changes that preschool brings. It can help them get a sense for what preschool will be like and how to adjust to it. Some books help children cope with the uncertainty or fears they have about making big transitions and being away from parents for a longer time.Read books specifically designed for getting a child ready for pre-school. Some books to check out from the library include, “Llama Llama Misses Mama,” “I Love You All Day Long,” “Maisy Goes to Preschool,” and, “What to Expect at Preschool.” 

tell them what to expect.  get familiar with the school.  play pretend preschool.  read books.

 Cut back dead or dying shoots to the healthy wood. All other shoots must be treated as follows.; , On rose bushes, these are shoots that you would target for removal. For climbing miniature roses, however, these shoots remain important for continued climbing growth. Remove only the tips of these growing shoots.  Fanning out long shoots is best done when the shoots are young and green (and therefore more pliable).  Cut back and shorten flowering shoots that have grown along the length of the previous year's branches. When doing this, leave one or two buds of the thinnest shoots. The rest can be removed.  These can, in the main, be kept. Tie these shoots back into the framework regularly to encourage growth in the pattern that you consider desirable.  

remove dead or dying shoots from the start.  keep long, strong shoots that have as much length as possible.  tie the long shoots to the trellis or framework against which the miniature climbing rose is growing.  keep new shoots in preference to old ones.  trim strong shoots carefully. 

 You can do it handheld, but there won't be nearly the precision that you want.   Alternatively, you can use a focusing rail or something like a Gorillapod with 'socks' on its 'feet'.; , It is next to impossible to shoot macro, let alone use a focusing rail if the subject is moving around.  As with all macro photography, you need a strong light.  It is best to have a certain order of focus. Front to back or back to front. , For the purposes of this article, the front. Take the photograph.  Take the photograph.  Take the photograph.   Obviously, this will differ greatly from snapping a panorama type image to a macro image. , Some are:   Adobe Photoshop (Commercial) Photoshop Lightroom Photoshop CS CombineZP (Freeware)  

be sure to have a tripod.  be sure the subject is very stable.  have a source of light.  set up your macro shot.  determine how much/how many shots you want to take and the area of focus.  ,  focus where you will start the stack at.  move slightly past the first point of focus.  take another shot just a little further back.  continue until you have all of the images that you need.  ,  offload them off to the computer and open the program that you will use to stack them in. 

 The Kangal dog has a large, but well-proportioned skull. Its skull is broad and slightly rounded with a slight furrow in its forehead. A distinctive dark “mask” covers the Kangal’s face. It generally covers its nose and muzzle, but can extend beyond its eyes.The Kangal’s muzzle tapers toward a large black nose with open nostrils.; , The Kangal has medium-sized eyes that may be almond or oval in shape. The color of its eyes can range from light amber to dark brown in color. The rims of its eyes are well-pigmented and will be either black or brown.Eye-rims that sag or have incomplete pigment are a disqualification. Having eyes that are of two different colors or blue eyes is a disqualification, as well.  The Kangal’s ears are dark in color and complement the color of the distinctive, dark mask on its face. It has triangular-shaped ears with rounded tips. Its ears are also medium-sized where the length of its ears is about six inches and the base about four inches in width.Its ears are set no higher than the top of the skull, i.e., slightly below the skull. They lay flat against the side of the Kangal’s face. When alert, the ears are slightly higher. Kangals do not have erect ears.  

observe the skull.  examine its eyes.  look at the ears. 

 Customers tend to be more willing to support businesses that support other local and small businesses in their community. To keep your customers happy you should try to reach out and collaborate with local businesses in your area. You can boost customer loyalty by supporting and promoting local services and products in your restaurant whenever possible.Skip music on iTunes or Amazon and play music by a local musician. Or have a local musician play live while people eat in your restaurant. Hang up art by local artists on the walls rather than stock art from a big box store. You can also include prices on the artwork so customers can buy the artwork directly from local artists.; , You should also make an effort to have local food items on your menu whenever possible, as this is beneficial for the environment and for your business. Replace food from a national distributor with food from a local farmer or a local producer. Make sure you note that food items are local on your menu and promote foods popular in your area so your customers know you support local producers.You should also make an effort to participate in local festivals and events as a way to promote your restaurant. Partner with another restaurant and collaborate on a special dish for a local festival. Or, create an event where you allow customers to sample local foods in your restaurant or at a local venue.  You can also keep your customers engaged and coming back by setting up a loyalty program. Most customers enjoy reaping the benefits of returning over and over to the same establishment. You should reward your customers so they have an incentive to return.You may set up a loyalty program using a rewards card program where customers earn points for returning to the restaurant or for spending a certain amount of money. This could be in the form of a low tech option like a paper punch card or a high tech option like a plastic rewards card that is swiped every time they come in. You could also start an account for customers where they earn certain perks after collecting enough points, such as a free appetizer or money off their bill.  You should always make an effort to make your customers feel like they are important to you by giving them personal attention. As the owner of the restaurant, you should try to spend time chatting briefly with regular customers who come in often and welcoming new customers who are dining for the first time. Stay in touch with your customers by dedicating at least one to two days a week giving personal attention to them.You may go around during dinner service and ask customers how they are enjoying their food or how they are finding their meal. You may also spend time chatting with long time customers about their personal lives, if you have established that kind of relationship with them. You can also give customers personal attention by dropping off food to the table yourself. Making your presence known to customers will show you are a dedicated owner and that you care about the happiness of your customers.  You should also keep your customers happy by handling customer complaints properly. Remember that the customer is always right, even if they seem wrong to you. You should take every customer complaint seriously and show appreciation for their feedback. This will keep your customers happy and feel as though their concern is being taken seriously.You should always listen to what the customer has to say and allow them to vent. You should acknowledge their complaint and then apologize. You may say, “I understand you are not happy and I apologize for the incident.” You should then offer a viable solution to the complaint. You may off some sort of compensation for the customer’s issue, such as a free round of drinks or a complimentary dessert.  You can draw new customers to your restaurant by upping your social media presence. Make sure you have an Instagram account for the restaurant as well as a blog. If your blog can be tied to your restaurant’s website, even better. Try to post images and text at least once a day to promote the restaurant and to attract new customers.You can also set up a Facebook page for the restaurant where you post day specials and promos. You may post things like "The first 20 customers get a free appetizer," that are specials on that day only, to draw customers in. You may also create an email newsletter that you send out to customers on a subscription basis. You should include images of dishes at the restaurant and include any promotions or specials for the week. You may also include some of the restaurant’s history or background so customers feel they are getting an inside look at the restaurant.  You can attract new patrons by embracing theme nights at your restaurant, with a theme or a special for each day of the week you are open. You may put a specific dish on special, such as Taco Tuesdays or Wing Night Wednesdays. You may also hold theme nights on certain days of the week, like Bring Your Own Wine Sundays or Half Off Mondays.You may want to start by having theme nights for the days of the week that tend to be slow or lacking in customers. This way, you can attract customers to the restaurant on the slower days and then gradually amp up the theme nights throughout the week.  Happy hour is a popular way for restaurants to fill their space with customers during the slower hours of the day. This promotion usually takes place from Monday to Thursday between 4 pm and 8 pm. You can offer your customers happy hour prices on drinks and food to satisfy their cravings after a long work day.You should create a happy hour menu that has half-price drinks, cheaper cocktails, and small dishes or nibbles that are low in price. This will encourage your customers to eat and drink a fair amount during happy hour.  If your restaurant has a great chef working in the kitchen, you may try creating “meet the chef” events. This will allow your customers to have a special night where they buy a ticket to spend time in the kitchen with your chef. You may offer a limited number of tickets to customers to make the event feel exclusive and special.You may feature a particular ingredient as part of the meet the chef event or have a theme for the event. You should create a custom menu for the event and invite customers to watch cooking demos done by your chef.  You can also promote your restaurant to new customers by creating new food and drink pairings with your chef or cook. You should work with a sommelier, if possible, to put together wine and food pairings using your existing menu.You may also collaborate with your bartender to create cocktail and food pairings to offer to customers. You should then promote your new food and drink pairings on social media, posting a picture of the pairings on Instagram and putting a short write up of each pairing on your restaurant’s blog.  You can actually boost customer loyalty and keep your restaurant running smoothly by retaining your employees. Having a revolving door of new employees will require you to spend time training and does not promote a community feel at your restaurant. One way you can retain your employees is to try to give them a competitive hourly wage, as many servers will earn extra money through tips. Paying your employees fairly will encourage them to stick around and work hard.The average pay in the U.S. for waitresses and waiters is $9.85.Factoring this hourly wage in with tips, your employees should be able to maintain a decent standard of living. You may decide to give your employees competitive pay and raise their pay on a sliding scale so they feel they are valued at your restaurant.  If possible, you should consider offering your employees benefits. Though traditionally, many service jobs do not come with health care benefits, you may want to work out a way to do this to better support your employees. Your staff should feel you are able to offer them what they need as an employer and employee benefits could help to boost their morale.One way you can make enough money to provide healthcare for your employees is to add a surcharge to all bills. The money for this surcharge can then go to funding health benefits for your staff. Often, this surcharge does not have to be much, about 3% of the total bill., You can also help your employees feel valued and cared for by creating quarterly employee only events. This could be a team building event like playing a sport together or doing team building exercises as part of the event. Make the events fun and inclusive for all your employees so they feel they have time to bond and connect.You may ask certain employees to join a social committee and allow them to plan the events on their own. You may set a budget for the event and then have the social committee collaborate with other employees to create fun events.  You can empower your employees by giving them the opportunity to grow within your business. One way to do this is to provide specialized training for them, where they can learn new skills or expand their existing skill set. You can do this training during off hours at the restaurant or send a group of employees to training sessions at another location.For example, you may set up a training session for employees who want to learn how to properly serve wine to customers. Or you may create training sessions for employees who want to learn how to properly recommend certain drinks to customers.  The prime costs of your restaurant will help you determine how profitable the restaurant is and if you are turning enough of a profit on a consistent basis. Your prime costs can be determined by the following equation: food cost + beverage cost + salaries and wages + payroll taxes + employee benefits = prime costs.Your prime costs should run at no more than 65 percent of your total sales. This will ensure you are making a healthy profit and are still able to pay all the costs of running of the restaurant.  To ensure you remain the owner of your restaurant for years to come, you should make sure you have a financial safety net in place. This will ensure that you have money to dip into if the restaurant experiences a sudden damaging event, such as a fire or structural damage to the building. You can also lean on this safety net if the restaurant starts to have lower profits, especially during times of the year that tend to be less busy., As the owner of the restaurant, you should also keep excellent and accurate financial records for the day to day operations of the business. You should have a clear record of costs and sales that cover the daily and monthly numbers of running the restaurant. You should keep all paper receipts on file and make sure you are recording all financial transactions so you have this information on hand.  You may start to feel overwhelmed with finances if you are doing them yourself as the owner of the restaurant. If you do not already have an accountant, you should consider hiring one. An accountant can help you stay on top of the restaurant’s finances and let you know ahead of time if there are going to be any financial issues that need to be addressed.You may also try using accounting software on your own to keep your finances straight. You can buy accounting software online or in store.  

support local businesses whenever possible.  promote local foods.  start a loyalty program.  give customers personal attention when they come in.  handle customer complaints with grace and make amends.  promote the restaurant on social media.  create special theme nights at the restaurant.  have a happy hour.  do a meet the chef event.  design new food and drink pairings.  give them competitive pay.  provide employee benefits.  plan quarterly employee events.  provide more specialized employee training.  calculate your prime costs every week.  make sure you have a financial safety net.  keep good financial records.  hire an accountant. 

 If at all possible, find ways to decrease the stress in your life, as this will likely help to soothe your psoriasis flare ups. Consider sharing your life stressors with a close friend, or even seeking professional help from a counsellor or psychologist.   You may also consider trying activities such as meditation, yoga, or taking walks out in nature as ways to invite a calm energy into your life. Increasing your aerobic exercise (exercise that elevates your heart rate, such as jogging, brisk walking, swimming, or cycling) to at least 30 minutes three times per week has been shown to decrease stress levels. Psoriasis also has a close association with depression, due to the psycho-social impact that the disease can have. If you believe that you may be suffering from depression, book an appointment with your family doctor. They will ask you further questions, and may offer you medical treatment for depression if needed. Dealing with any concurrent depression may help to reduce your stress, and to decrease the severity of your psoriasis.  If you have been contemplating quitting smoking, now may be the time to do so.   You can consult your family doctor for support in quitting smoking. They can offer you nicotine replacement options as needed, as well as medications (if you are interested) that can help to tame your craving for cigarettes (such as Wellbutrin, Chantix, or bupropion).  There are also injectable medications, known as "biologics," that your doctor may recommend if other strategies to combat your psoriasis flare ups have been ineffective at producing the desired results.   Biologics are the next generation of medication of immunological diseases like psoriasis. Before you start any biologic therapy, such as a TNF alpha inhibitor it is important to get tested for tuberculosis, as this could complicate treatment. Talk with your healthcare provider about safely starting these medications.  Speak to your naturopath for further information.   It is important to always mention to your doctor any natural remedies you are trying, to ensure that they do not interfere with any of the medical treatments you are on.  This is because it is a condition that cannot be fully cured; it can only be managed as effectively as possible.  

reduce your stress.psoriasis flare ups have a strong correlation to emotional and psychological stress.  quit smoking.smoking has been tied to worsening of psoriasis as well as to more frequent and more severe psoriasis flare ups.  consider other medical options.oral treatments for psoriasis flare ups that can be prescribed by your doctor include methotrexate, retinoids, and apremilast.  inquire about natural remedies.some natural remedies that may help with psoriasis flare ups include aloe vera, apple cider vinegar, tea tree oil, and turmeric, among other things.  understand that psoriasis cannot be cured.if you have been diagnosed with psoriasis, even if the lesions go away, you are always at risk of them returning throughout your life. 

 These drugs are usually the first step in treating UC and other inflammatory bowel diseases.   Aminosalicylates such as as sulfasalazine can effectively reduce UC symptoms. This medication can produce a variety of side effects, including digestive distress and headaches. Other medications in this family include mesalamine, balsalazide, and olsalazine. These medications are available in oral and enema or suppository forms. Cortisteroids, including prednisone and hydrocortisone, are generally used when moderate to severe UC does not respond to other treatments. They are delivered orally, intravenously, or via enema or suppository. Steroids can produce many side effects, so they are not usually a long-term treatment., These drugs reduce inflammation too, but they do so by targeting the immune response that produces the inflammation. Sometimes they are used in combination with a cortisteroid.   Azathioprine and mercaptopurine are the immune system suppressors most commonly prescribed to UC patients. Infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab are “biologics,” or immune system suppressors that operate by neutralizing a protein that your immune system produces. These medications are generally prescribed to moderate or severe UC sufferers. Vedolizumab was recently approved for patients who have not responded to other types of immunosuppressant drugs., Always talk with your doctor before beginning a new medication regimen. Doctors will often recommend one or more of the following in addition to prescription medication:   Antibiotics, especially when a flare-up is causing you to run a fever. Anti-diarrheal medications, especially if your diarrhea has become severe. Acetaminophen for mild pain relief. Note that ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, and diclofenac sodium can all worsen UC symptoms and should therefore be avoided. Iron supplements to combat anemia, especially if you are experiencing bleeding., Between 20 and 30 percent of people with UC will eventually need to undergo a colectomy (removal of colon) or proctocolectomy (removal of colon and rectum) due to massive bleeding, severe illness, rupture of the colon, or cancer risk. Surgery does usually eliminate the disease altogether. Your surgeon will create an internal pouch from a portion of your small intestine that empties into your anus, allowing you to expel waste relatively normally.Note that sometimes it is not possible to construct an internal pouch. If this is the case, your surgeon will create a permanent opening in your abdomen (a colostomy), through which stool is collected in an attached bag., UC does increase your risk of colon cancer, so it is important to go in for a surveillance colonoscopy every one to two years. 

consult your doctor about anti-inflammatory drugs.  talk to your doctor about immune system suppressors.  use over-the-counter medications to help manage uc symptoms.  talk to your doctor about surgical treatment.  pursue regular colon cancer screening. 

 Botulism in all its forms is a serious life threatening illness and requires immediate medical treatment. The sooner you get medical attention, the better your recovery. Call emergency services by calling 911 in North America. Symptoms of foodborne botulism present 12 to 36 hours after eating contaminated food and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, blurred or double vision, slurred speech, drooping eyelids, dry mouth or difficulty swallowing or talking, sudden facial muscle weakness, trouble breathing, and paralysis. Foodborne botulism comes from environments with little oxygen, such as canned and bottled foods and foods fresh from the soil.Symptoms of infant botulism begin with constipation, floppy movements, drooping eyelids, weak cries, drooling and difficulty sucking or feeding, and paralysis. Infants contract botulism via spores that get into the intestinal tract and convert to toxins inside the body. Infants who develop botulism are typically between two to eight months of age and have ingested honey or soil.Symptoms of wound botulism are the same as in foodborne, except you will not have nausea, vomiting, or abdominal cramps. Spores can convert to toxins inside open wounds and are commonly found in cuts you haven’t noticed and intravenous drug users’ injection sites.Botulism does not increase blood pressure or heart rate or cause confusion. You may have a fever if you have wound botulism.; , Antitoxin is one of the first lines of early defense in fighting botulism. Antitoxin cannot reverse damage already done but can reduce the risk of further complications and nerve damage. Antitoxin is delivered via a slow intravenous infusion. Antitoxin is derived from horse serum so a skin sensitivity test will be done before administration.  Because the toxin in botulism weakens muscles to the point of paralysis, you can stop breathing. Medical treatment for botulism therefore usually includes time on a ventilator to help you breathe until the effects of the toxin have cleared your system. This could take several weeks., Medical treatment for foodborne botulism usually involves induced or forced vomiting and medications to cause bowel movements. The goal is to clear the food substance out of your system., Wound debridement is the removal of dead or infected tissue, thereby removing toxins in the wound if you have wound botulism. 

get to a hospital immediately.  be prepared to receive an antitoxin.  expect respiratory treatment.  anticipate vomiting and bowel movements.  undergo wound cleansing and debridement. 

 An abstract is a summary of the experiment. It assumes that the reader knows something about the subject area, but has not read the paper itself. It should be around 200 words.An introduction, meanwhile, details the type of experiment, its objects and importance, along with general background information needed to understand the experiment. It has nothing to do with the findings of the experiment.  Whether you're working on temperature models, DNA/RNA replication, or plate-tectonics, a good introduction adequately explains what the experiment is going to be about. A great introduction will make it clear which factors will determine whether the experiment is going to be successful.  What do you aim to figure out by undertaking this experiment? These objectives should be related to, but not synonymous with, your hypothesis. Your objectives will be analyzed in your conclusion, and are therefore extremely important to be clear about.  It may be helpful to list any theoretical predictions for what the experiment might yield, especially if your experiment resulted in a groundbreaking finding. This provides a contrast between what's expected and what is actually true.  

know the difference between an abstract and an introduction.  briefly explain the experiment.  explain the experiment's objectives.  provide any theoretical predictions for what the results will yield, if applicable. 

 Oral irrigators, such as water-picks, can be used to push tonsil stones out of their cavities.Test it out briefly on your tonsils before you buy it—if the spray is too strong, and hurts in any way, don't use it to get out your stones.  Place the irrigator inside the mouth but not touching the stone, and switch on the oral irrigator on the lowest setting. Direct the stream of water onto one visible tonsil stone, keeping it steady until the stone has been dislodged.  If the irrigator is loosening the stones but not removing them, alternate using the pic and using a cotton swab or the back of your toothbrush.   Repeat steps for each visible tonsil stone. Remember to be gentle as you pressurize the stones away with the water.  

buy an oral irrigator.  use the irrigator on its lowest setting.  help your stones along with a cotton swab or toothbrush. 

 What DO you love about your appearance? Is it your eyes, lips, hair? What don't you like?; , What are your best characteristics?  , Also, do not put impossible things in the dislike column. Example: I am too tall. That's something you can't change, so embrace it!  , With pimples and changes in your body it's easy to begin to feel insecure at times, but no matter what, keep your head high and let it be known you love who you are. Don't be arrogant because no one likes a snob, but if people make fun of you, use your humor to turn the joke back on them. If you're sure of who you are and what you believe, the other girls will want to be like you.  If you don't like your hair, try a new style. If you wish you could be more patient, start practicing!  , But keep it natural. Ashley Tisdale says, "I always think natural makeup is prettiest. It just looks prettier." And it's no lie! Mascara, eyeliner, powder, and lip gloss are all you need. If you don't want to wear makeup, that's fine, too.  For a cute style read How to Be a Preppy Girl.  Set goals for yourself!  , Sports are a great way to meet people and make new friends. They also help you stay in shape and learn new skills. Discipline is something else you learn in sport, which makes you a good leader and liked by other teen girls.  It's tempting to try to dress or act like someone else as a teen girl to get attention, but whenever you try to imitate someone else you always end up second. No one can do you better than you. Besides, people can tell when you're being fake.  

look in the mirror.  then think about your personality, what annoys people about you?,  make a list of those like & dislikes, but don't put more than 5 in the dislike list.  act confident.  now go out and fix what you don't like about yourself (that you can)!,  ask your mom, or other loved one to teach you to apply make up.  dress fashionably, but modestly.  study in school, and do the best you can.  get involved in sports or school activities.  be yourself. 

 It's better to listen to a piano version, but other instruments will also help. Your mind will pick up the melody and rhythm, and then knowing the tune makes it easier to know whether you are producing the intended sound for what you read.; , It is very important to realise whether you can't -- by either technical skill or physical technique -- play the song; so, you don't start and have to quit because of things you don't know.  It is very annoying to practice the song with a metronome, and one might not help. But, maybe it is syncopated (a kind of off-beat rhythm), varied from a standard rhythmic accent:Throw a pair of tennis shoes or jeans in the clothes dryer. Chances are the rhythm you hear will be syncopated, like an ad-lib, varied from standard, but in a general pattern, such as jazz.  This follows the level of how good you are at reading notes.   Read and play only one hand at a time.  Practice the treble and the base clef separately.   Read and put both hands together when you can. Read both hands and characterise the tune of the song properly working up to the desired speed.  Learning to read notes takes many hours practice, but saves you from fumbling later. As a student you can read loads of notes, not only music supplied by the teacher, but also found other places by yourself. 

learn the tune before you attempt to read and play the song.  prepare by scanning and visualising the notes first to find parts you might get in trouble with reading while playing.  make sure to stay in tempo!,  try these steps to reading notes.  remember, these skill won't come by themselves.  study up, ask and read about different methods of scoring music to know whether it's for vocal or instrumental, duet, trio, 4 part harmony, or "easy piano", or is sheet music with a lead-sheet with a melody line and numbered chords for a studio musician, or geared for a jazz ensemble. 

 If you purchase new energy efficient appliances in the U.S., you can qualify for a tax credit for 10% of costs up to $500 or a specific amount from $50-$300. This only applies for an existing home that is your principal residence. New construction and rentals do not apply. Relevant appliances include stoves, heat pumps, air conditioning, water heaters, furnaces, fans, insulation, roofs, windows, doors, and skylights.You can apply for these credits on the Department of Energy’s website. The site will also inform you about local and state benefits you can apply for.These benefits apply to the U.S. Look for similar programs if you live in a different country. You might also look into installing solar panels. Using solar energy may provide you with some utility savings and tax credits.  You can receive tax deductions for mortgage interest, lender points, mortgage insurance premiums, home improvements, home equity loans, and being a first-time buyer. You can indicate your qualification for these breaks on the appropriate federal tax form in January and receive information about your deduction a few weeks later.Look for similar tax-incentive programs at the state and local level in the U.S., and in other nations as well.  If your home is purchased with less than twenty percent paid down, your lender will require private mortgage insurance. PMI can add significant costs to your mortgage and you’ll want to pay enough of the principal to remove it as soon as possible.If you’d like to remove your PMI before you can pay off a sufficient amount of the principal, you can also remodel to increase your house’s market value, refinance, or get a new appraisal. Remodeling can increase the equity of your home. This is because the additions you make add value greater than the cost of the additions and this will reflect in the equity to meet the 20% level.  Figuring out how to save money on your mortgage or maximize your tax savings can be tricky, especially when you're trying to settle in to a new house. Consult with your mortgage lender, an accountant or tax advisor, an attorney, and so on to discuss your options and opportunities for savings. The initial costs of a consultation will likely be a drop in the bucket in comparison to the significant savings you can accumulate for years to come.   Refinancing your mortgage or appealing your property tax assessment, to name a few examples, can easily save you thousands of dollars in the years to come. However, this is not usually something you would consider right after purchasing a home. It might just be something to consider later on.  

apply for federal energy efficiency benefits.  research tax deductions.  pay off private mortgage insurance.  talk to the experts.

 Then, soak the mung beans in water for two hours.  Add the pandan leaves. Then, put in the ginger for five minutes only, after which time, fish it out.  Cook until the mung beans pop and are soft. , This forms the dough base for the mung bean balls.  Set aside and leave until it cools down completely. , For the first bowl, add the coconut pulp that you used to make the milk. In the second bowl, tip the coconut milk.  Add an egg, and some salt, and the coconut milk. Stir the ingredients together until smooth, then tip in the vanilla extract, to give it a sweet taste. Stir again until combined. This forms the batter.  Stir the dough and pulp together until they combine as one.   Form the mung bean balls. Take a spoonful of dough and form it into a ball, then press to form a round flat. Repeat until you have used up all of the dough and have formed as many balls as possible.  Dip the mung bean balls, one by one, into the batter bowl. Be sure to dip enough to cover all of the ball's surface. This will help to prevent the ball from breaking apart during frying.  Cook them until the outer part of the balls become golden and crisp.   Do this in batches. Do not try to fry too many balls at the same time.  Remove the mung bean balls from the frying pan and the kumbu kacang ijo are ready to served.

 Minecraft fans have created tools that analyze your seed or save game and locate the villages for you. You can then take these coordinates and use them to find the village in your game. Note that these finder tools are usually about 66% accurate, as one-third of villages do not spawn as they should.   One of the most popular village finders is Chunkbase's. You can access it at chunkbase.com/apps/village-finder. Use an up-to-date browser like Chrome to access all of the features of the finder. There is currently no village finder tool that works for Minecraft PE.  The quickest way to load your world is to enter your current seed. If you're playing on PC, you can load your level.dat file from %appdata%\.minecraft\saves.   To find the seed for your current game, type /seed into the chat window. If you're playing a multiplayer game, you'll need to ask one of the admins for the seed.  After loading the seed, the grid below will be populated by brown dots representing villages. If you're too zoomed in, you may not see any dots at first. Zoom out by scrolling the mouse wheel down until you see some dots.  As you move your mouse cursor over the map, you'll see the coordinates change at the bottom. Move your cursor over one of the dots to see the coordinates of the village in the game. Because the map shows all possible villages, you'll want to make a note of several in case a few didn't get generated correctly.  Once you're playing, you can look up your coordinates to help you find the village. You can also use the teleport command to move directly to them without having to explore.   On PC, press F3 to find your coordinates. If you're playing Minecraft PE, you'll need to use a third-party tool to find your coordinates. On the console versions, you can see your coordinates when you use a map. See Find Your Coordinates in Minecraft for more details. To teleport to a specific location, type /tp name X Y Z when cheats are enabled. For Minecraft PE you'll need to use an inventory editor app to teleport. In the console versions, you can only teleport to other players. See Teleport in Minecraft for more details.  The village finder will display all possible villages, but the game will only generate about 2/3 of them. This means you have a good chance of coming across a non-existent village at the location you picked. If this happens, just move on to the next coordinates you noted.   The console editions of Minecraft exhibit odd behavior for villages, and you may come across many that are only a well with no buildings. The village finder tool can also miss villages for the console versions. This can make finding a valid village more difficult in the console versions.  

visit a village finder tool in your web browser.  enter your seed or load your save file.  zoom out on the map.  make a note of several villages to check out.  find your coordinates in-game.  check out another village if the first one isn't there. 

 The balance board can be remarkably sensitive. The balance board must record your weight before you can perform most exercises or play most games. To ensure that the balance board weighs you accurately, place it on a hard, flat, and clean surface such as a tiled/wooden floor. Uneven surfaces such as carpets can interfere with weight measurements.; , It starts off with only some basic poses such as: cobra, tree, and downward-facing dog. In order to unlock more poses, you will need to master the yoga basics. Then you will be able to perform yoga poses such as spinal twist, chair, and palm tree. Be sure to focus on your core and make sure that you breathe. Furthermore, you should try to distribute your body-weight evenly in order to avoid causing one part of your body to bear the brunt of the exercise. Despite the fact that you have already mastered some yoga poses, you will need to go back and "review" previous yoga poses.   Before doing exercises like aerobics and strength-training, do yoga. It will stretch out your body and prepare you for the more difficult exercises that lie ahead.  When you try the aerobics, you will probably notice that you can gain more points and unlock activities more quickly by having good form. For example, when you are signaled to catch the hula-hoops that are thrown, raise both of your arms up to the sky and lean your body over in the direction that the hula-hoop is coming from. Time your movements to the same beat of the music that is played in order to get perfect timing on the basic step game. During the running exercises, keeping a steady speed will help you exceed 100 percent and unlock more levels.  The strength training exercises were designed in a matter consistent to build the muscles in your arms, legs, chest and core. Increase the amount of repetitions that you do and motivate yourself by listening to music, and unlock the trainer challenge mode. Then challenge your trainer head to head in the jackknife, parallel stretch, and the push-up exercises. A competitor motivates you to push your limits, and if you win you will feel great.  When playing the balance games, move your abdominal muscles minimally while you move your weight to the left and right. If you are trying to gain momentum in the ski jump game, shift your balance to the blue dot that is shown on the screen. For the soccer ball dodging game, try not to get hit by the shoes and panda heads, but shift your weight to the left or right side in order to touch the soccer balls with your head. Try to not randomly move around, and if you are behind on timing, skip the ball that is coming at you and wait for the next soccer ball to come at you.  

weigh yourself accurately in the body tests.  spend time performing the yoga exercises.  perform aerobics.  challenge the trainer in strength training and yoga.  engage your core in order to stay balanced. 

 A vegan diet can be a very healthy alternative and allow you to lose weight in a very healthy way; however, you have to spend some time ensuring adequate intake of the specific nutrients, particularly iron, zinc, Vitamin B12, omega-3 essential fats, and Vitamin D. These are critically important for your health., Make an appointment with a dietitian who can help you ensure you are getting adequate nutrition. They can help you write up a meal plan that provides all the essential nutrients and answer any questions you might have about being vegan. They can help you set weight loss goals and make sure you stay healthy while you drop pounds.  Have your blood regularly tested for deficiencies, especially if you are new to a vegan diet. Tell your physician about your food choices and your concerns. Conditions caused by nutritional deficiencies can be identified and rectified.Treating these deficiencies may require changing some of your dietary choices. This doesn't mean you need to give up your vegan lifestyle, but you may need to increase your intake of certain foods or consider supplements. Your physician or dietitian can help you with this.  Keep track of your food and use a nutrient calculator to make sure you are getting all the nutrients you need. This helps you monitor your vitamin, mineral, and nutrient levels to make sure you are getting everything you need every day.You can use nutrient trackers like FitDay and Chronometer and check out nutrition data.  Fish are not the only source of omega-3 fats. There are vegan sources, like nuts and seeds. These nuts and seeds can be raw.   Try flax seeds (golden or dark brown), chia seeds, or hemp seeds.Walnuts, pecans, almonds, peanuts, and virtually all nuts are healthy sources of omega-3 fats.  Leafy green vegetables should be a staple of your diet. They include a wide array of nutrients that your body needs. One important nutrient that leafy green vegetables have is omega-3 fats.They also contain calcium and iron.You can cook your greens, eat them raw, or even put them in a smoothie. Great examples of leafy green vegetables include:   Greens of beets, radishes, mustard, collard, Swiss chard, turnips Spinach, kale, Chinese cabbage (bok choy), cabbage, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, arugula, field greens, purslane, romaine lettuce  , Tofu has a lot of protein, zinc, iron, calcium, vitamin D, and omega-3s. You can substitute tofu for meat in just about any dish. Try it in stir fries, pastas, and even on sandwiches.Firm tofu works great for recipes since it holds its shape.  Beans are important for a vegan diet because it provides a large amount of protein, which is important to maintain when going vegan. Beans also are rich in fiber, among other important nutrients. Legumes are similar to beans. They contain a lot of fiber and B vitamins.You can eat beans and lentils in soups, casseroles, as side dishes. There are endless possibilities. Good examples include mung beans, navy beans, kidney beans, soybeans, black beans, and lentils.  Winter and summer squashes are wonderful foods to add to your diet. Winter squashes are a great source of omega-3s, among other nutrients.Summer squashes, like yellow squash and zucchini, provide nutrients and are versatile components of your diet.   Winter squashes include acorn, butternut, spaghetti squash, and pumpkin.  If you need to, make sure you take vegan-safe supplements. If you eat a varied diet full of fruits and vegetables, you should get all the proper nutrients you need. But supplements can help, particularly to get enough zinc, iron, selenium, and calcium. 

ensure you get the proper nutrients.  visit a registered dietitian.  get regular blood tests.  track your nutrition.  eat nuts and seeds.  incorporate leafy green vegetables.  substitute tofu for meat.  eat beans and lentils.  add in squash.  take supplements. 

 Included in the search engine of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is the Global Patent Search Network. This will allow you to search the full text of multiple international patent databases.The GPSN currently includes information from 1985 through 2012. Regular updates are expected. You can access the GPSN by visiting the USPTO.gov site, then following the links to “Patents,” “Patent Search,” and then “Global Patent Search Network.”  , This database, the EPO, is available at www.EPO.org. From the home page, you simply select the tab “Searching for Patents,” and you will be directed to the EPO search tool. On this site, you will have access to millions of patent documents, including resources throughout Europe and Asia., The European Patent Register is an extension of the European Patent Office (EPO). This is a free online service that contains all European patent applications from the moment they are published. It includes links to all the national offices for the countries that subscribe to the EPO.In addition to simply searching for patents, the European Patent Register includes information about the current stage of a patent application, whether or not a European patent has been granted yet, and whether any oppositions have been filed to a European patent. It also includes copies of correspondence between the EPO and patent applicants or their attorneys. You can access the European Patent Register by going through the EPO website at www.epo.org, and then selecting the links to “Searching for Patents” and finally “European Patent Register” under the heading of “Quick Access.”  , The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has a website that is accessible to search over 57 million worldwide patent documents.The WIPO page is translatable into ten different languages: English, French, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Arabic. You can conduct a search on the WIPO site by visiting its home page at www.wipo.int, and then following the links to “Reference” and “Patentscope.” Within the Patentscope search tool, you can search for individual terms to find patent information, or you can browse the week’s applications and approvals.

 These could include prison, homelessness, job loss, financial difficulties, serious medical problems such as an overproduction of serotonin and even death.; , Maybe investing in a career, or practicing an instrument. Drugs can destroy family ties, so spend time strengthening bonds with your family and friends.  Think about the compliments received from utilizing your skills, the rewards of pursuing an interesting career, or how much your new found self-esteem really means to you. Write down your goals and tick each goal as you achieve it. Don't set your goals too high, make sure they are reasonable, or you will just set yourself up for failure.  If you were taking drugs, the results would never be as good. , It could be a street corner or a party. By now, you should be able to tell the person why you choose to refuse or chose not to participate in what they are offering. If in a moment of weakness you choose to try drugs again, first, think it through very carefully. Second, make sure you are in a safe environment with people you love and trust.  Try immersing yourself in activities that are made more difficult by drugs, such as driving, talking on the phone, learning something new, or jogging.  This will help you be more accountable, and it should provide you with positive feedback from someone who genuinely cares about you. , Just because many Rock Stars, actors or friends use them doesn't make them cool; you must make your own decisions. For every star who looks cool taking drugs, there is one who is in rehab, or has died.  If you don't make mistakes in life, how will you learn? Accept your mistakes and don't be hypocritical when you see people around you making the same mistakes. The thing that matters is what lies ahead of you, not what is in your past. The past has taught you a valuable lesson. Learning from your mistakes has made you a stronger person today.  Make sure you are firm and strong. If you come across as weak, the person following you will latch on.  Try to lose them if at all possible. Find a crowded location or look for somewhere you can find someone responsible and reputable. If you're in school, find a teacher.  Make sure that you alert an appropriate person about the encounter. Give all the details you can.  This step is one to take if you are not in school. Move away from those who have offered you drugs before calling the police. If they hear you, they may become angry or violent.  You should avoid the person who offered drugs at all costs. It would also be advisable to avoid the place where you were offered drugs.  example: No thanks, lets go play some baseball.  example: No thanks! My parents would ground me for life!  

realize that abusing drugs may lead to devastating events in people's lives.  think about what other things in life you can do, such as activities that are more fulfilling than drugs.  examine all activities broadly, to help you discover what you really want from a new career.  compare the results, long term and short term, of your new lifestyle.  realize that enjoying life and pursuing new interests is more satisfying and easier (long term anyway) than abusing drugs.  ,  prepare yourself for occasions where strangers may offer drugs to you.  try to associate with people who do not use drugs, and avoid situations where they will be used and given or offered to you.  have a good friend who you can talk to about any situation where you are tempted to take drugs.  remember that the future is full of promise and abusing drugs might rob you of those beautiful things in life.  ,  look at the list of people who have been destroyed, even killed, by drugs.  forgive yourself if you feel you made a mistake by trying drugs.  just say no.  walk away.  tell an adult about it.  call the police or an authoritative person.  avoid further encounters.  change the subject.  state a fact. 

 Learning assertiveness and the finesse of pointing out the harmful, critical patterns of others in a loving and productive way is in an important step toward dealing with put downs. Cultivate power by standing up for yourself and altering the environment to prevent future put-downs.   Being assertive is different than being aggressive. Try speaking clearly and maintaining eye contact while being a receptive listenerCommunicating assertively can help increase self confidence, gain the respect of others, improve decision-making skills, and enable conflict resolution.; , Often people are too different to be able to see eye to eye. You will come across many people who don't make you feel particularly good to be around, and others will feel the same way about you. The key is to see that, even though not all people are meant to be friends, this does not make you or the other person bad. Incompatibility is just another part of life that we can learn to respond to with grace or with defensiveness and cruelty. When somebody puts you down, it's about that person and not you. Here are the top reasons people might criticize you:   They are threatened by your competence, attractiveness, etc. so they are trying to level the playing field. They have a concern about your motivation, skill level, performance or contribution. They feel you are not doing your share of the work or being a team player. They have a strong unmet need that is not being satisfied. They have a controlling personality and have to be in charge. They feel entitled to special treatment or status and do not feel they are receiving it. They want to make you look bad so as to advance their own position or curry favor with the bosses, etc. They feel insecure and are overcompensating. They think you are making them look bad in front of others.  When we feel hurt or put down, it is easy to take the position of the victim and assume there’s nothing we can do to change these bad feelings. Seeing that there are always choices you can make to improve your situation, try to think about your options for responding and your approach moving forward.For instance, if a peer at school consistently puts you down, remember that you always have the choice to ignore that person entirely. If you feel that this is not the best way to handle the problem, think about who can get involved to help you assert your desire for some distance. In a public forum, such as a meeting, you may want to argue for the value of your decision or work and correct any misperceptions. With family or friends, you may want to let them know that you genuinely want to understand their concerns, but that you don't always agree. Depending on the situation, you may want to assert yourself by saying, "Let's agree to disagree."With aggressive children or teenagers, you may want to acknowledge that their feeling is legitimate, but that they need to work on a more respectful delivery.  If you've just been put down, you probably feel embarrassed, upset, or filled with a sense of injustice. While these feelings shouldn't be denied, see that they also offer you paths besides feeling stuck in them.View the put down as a learning experience that is giving you practice for how to be more resilient in the face of whatever comes.   After all, life is full of situations that we wouldn't necessarily choose, and the way we respond to these situations is the difference between ruminating in sadness and getting excited about how much hurt you can learn to let go of Understand what happened on your own terms. Ask yourself, according to your own values: What went well? What didn’t go well? What can I do better next time?Try practicing mindfulness in the moment. It can be helpful to remove yourself from the hurt emotions and take a moment to ask what the put downs say about the other person.  It is much easier to look realistically at what has happened to us and where we can go from the put-down when we drop thoughts that skew our thoughts into exaggerated, negative evaluations of our situations. The following are some examples ways of thinking that make it difficult to see the reality of our situation:Fortune telling is when we assume that things will turn out badly without having any real basis for this prediction. Black-and-white thinking is when we only look at things in terms of extreme judgments. In black-and-white thinking everything is either good or bad (even if reality tells us that things are too complicated for this sort of judgment). Mind-reading is when we think we know what others are thinking (and it’s usually the worst about us!) In reality, we can’t know what others are thinking. Labelling is when we choose a simple label like “stupid” or “ugly” to describe a behavior, situation, or person that is much too complex to be summed up in just one word. Labels are usually negative and make us forget the other aspects in play.  It is easy to ask yourself, "Why me?" in tough situations. Getting stuck in the "why me" mindframe can make it hard to see the lessons that always come with hardships. Seek meaning by changing "Why me?" questions to questions like "What do I now see about why and how some people put others down?" or "What can I do to play a role in stopping the cruelty that I have experienced?"   The most resilient people come up with constructs about their suffering, ways to see the message that they are receiving about life through their suffering. This is means the situation is meaningful despite being uncomfortable., In many situations, the putdown that you hear will have very little to do with who you are and what happened in reality. In these cases the put down may not even be worth gratifying with serious consideration about the incident or what you could have done differently.   Think about the absurdity of judging yourself based on one single instance. It doesn't make much sense to think that one slip-up or one person's opinion of you should factor into your sense of who you are, does it? Try laughing about the fact that you are much more complex than one putdown could possibly capture.  There are so many things that we cannot control, including others’ decisions. So, bouncing back can be made easier by rediscovering your ability to have a positive impact.Work on something that you can control, like an art project or a challenging new assignment at work or in school. Observe yourself being dedicated to something (and rocking it!) to remember that you are capable of contributing lots of good to the world around you.  Friends, family, and other supportive relationships in your life are very important to your ability to bounce back from putdowns. Make sure that you have people in your life who will listen to you speak freely about painful experiences without judgment.   Keep your support system close, even when these people are not with you physically. When you feel kicked around by the world, think about these people. What do they show you about the good in your personality? How does it feel to be around them? Then, you can be the person you are when you're around them even in their absence.  If you are being put down time and time again by the same person or group of people, you may be a dealing with bullying. Bullying is a serious offense, and it's important to reach out to your teachers, parents, or counselors who can help put an end to the problem. The following are signs that you are being bullied and should seek help:The put down involves actions like making threats, spreading rumors, launching physical or verbal attacks, and purposeful exclusion. The person bullying you has power over you, like physical strength, popularity, or access to information that can be used to harm or embarrass you. The behavior happens more than once and has the potential to continue.  If you are trying to love yourself more, shame is one of your worst enemies--it tells you that simply being you is something fundamentally bad or wrong.Since shame is usually directed toward the parts of you that you try to hide, writing about your deeper feelings (even the ones that make you embarrassed or disgusted) can help you come to understand that there is nothing wrong with what's inside. When you journal, write about the difficulties and pains that you encountered throughout the day, including things you judged yourself about.For each painful moment or event, practice re-framing the experience through a lens of compassion. Think about what you learned from what happened and be generous to yourself regarding how you acted, knowing that you have plenty of opportunities to respond differently. Try writing in a journal each day for a couple weeks to get comfortable with your own perspective. You might be surprised when you read back over your entries--look at this inquisitive, sensitive person who must've been writing!  , In a world so focused on progress and improvement, we can easily forget the importance of accepting the things about ourselves that we cannot change. You have unique gifts and shortcomings that make you who you are. Acceptance of yourself and your feelings, rather than forcefully shutting them out, can help you to work with what you have. This will help you discover who you are and what you're truly capable of (and not just what you think you should be capable of).   Acceptance has been shown to contribute directly to self-love by reducing the shame that tells us that we are not good enough or that we would be more desirable people if we could feel and act otherwise.One thing that everyone must accept is that the past cannot be changed or overwritten. Since this is the case, focus on the future--what you do have control over is how you learn from and respond to the situations that you find yourself in currently.  Strong values are help fill our lives with meaning that is personal to us. This is because knowing your values offers you ways to understand what's happening around you.Your values will also clue you in to the put downs that matter to you in the grand scheme, and let you know when these setbacks are just insignificant bouts of negativity that can be ignored.   For example, say your values prioritize celebrating accomplishments and you go out to a restaurant with friends to celebrate a promotion. If you get some eye-rolls from neighboring tables for wearing party hats and glitter, who cares? You are acting according to your values and not others' standards for proper celebratory behavior.  Are you on top of the habits that contribute to your overall lifestyle? Pay attention to the things that are very important but easily slip through the cracks, and take care of yourself as if you are caring for a loved one (because you are!).   Do you eat well? Ask yourself whether or not you have consistent means to provide yourself with nutrient-rich foods that your body needs. How much sleep are you getting? Do you frequently feel tired during the day due to lack of steady sleeping habits? What about exercise? Getting 30 minutes of brisk cardiovascular exercise each day improves mood, overall functioning, and reduces risk of chronic illnesses.  Spend time by yourself learning what you like to do or fostering hobbies and interests that you already have. Seek out your passions and talents and dedicate a certain amount of time doing what you love each week. Maybe your thing is writing short stories or cooking the meals your mom used to make when you were young. By simply reconnecting with your favorite activities you make your world a little more accommodating to your deeper needs that are easily overlooked when work, school, and other duties stress you out.  In our fast paced world, relaxation is hard to come by--and all the more important because of its rare occasion. When you intentionally take steps to relax, you are giving yourself a great gift and affirming to yourself that you deserve this break at the same time. The following are some tools you can learn in order to put together an effective relaxation regime for whenever you should need it:   Mindfulness meditation Yoga Deep breathing Progressive muscle relaxation  

respond with finesse.  accept reality.  take stock of your choices.  learn to re-frame your current situation.  check your thinking for negativity traps.  seek meaning from put downs.  laugh off the put down.  shift your focus to something you can control.  seek social support.  know when to seek outside help.  shed shame.  work on self-acceptance.  develop your values.  take responsibility for your general well-being.  focus on your interests.  learn to relax. 

 You can transpose any matrix, regardless of how many rows and columns it has. Square matrices, with an equal number of rows and columns, are most commonly transposed, so we'll use a simple square matrix as an example:matrix A = 1  2  3 4  5  6 7  8  9; , Rewrite row one of the matrix as a column:   transpose of matrix A = AT  first column of AT: 1 2 3  , The second row of the original matrix becomes the second column of its transpose. Repeat this pattern until you have turned every row into a column:    AT = 1  4  7 2  5  8 3  6  9  , The transposition is exactly the same for a non-square matrix. You rewrite the first row as the first column, the second row as the second column, and so forth. Here's an example with color-coding to show you where the elements end up:   matrix Z =4  7  2  13  9  8  6  matrix ZT =4  37  92  81  6   , The concept is pretty simple, but it's good to be able to describe it in mathematics. No jargon is required beyond basic matrix notation:   If matrix B is an m x n matrix (m rows and n columns), the transposed matrix BT is an n x m matrix (n rows and m columns).For each element bxy (xth row, yth column) in B, the matrix BT has an equal element at byx (yth row, xth column).  If you switch them again, you're back where you started.  In a square matrix, transposition "flips" the matrix over the main diagonal. In other words, the elements in a diagonal line from element a11 to the bottom right corner will remain the same. Each other elements will move across the diagonal and end up at the same distance from the diagonal, on the opposite side.   If you can't visualize this, draw a 4x4 matrix on a piece of paper. Now fold is over the main diagonal. See how elements a14 and a41 touch? They trade places in the transpose, as does each other pair that touches when folded.  A symmetric matrix is symmetric across the main diagonal. If we use the "flip" or "fold" description above, we can immediately see that nothing changes. All the element pairs that trade places were already identical.In fact, this is the standard way to define a symmetric matrix. If matrix A = AT, then matrix A is symmetric.  Complex matrices have elements with a real and imaginary component. While you can take an ordinary transpose of these matrices, most practical calculations involve the conjugate transpose instead.Matrix C = 2+i     3-2i 0+i     5+0i   , The complex conjugate changes the sign of the imaginary components, without altering the real components. Perform this operation for all elements of the matrix.   complex conjugate of C = 2-i     3+2i 0-i     5-0i   , Take an ordinary transposition of the result. The matrix you end up with is the conjugate transpose of the original matrix.   conjugate transpose of C = CH = 2-i        0-i 3+2i     5-0i   

start with any matrix.  turn the first row of the matrix into the first column of its transpose.  repeat for the remaining rows.  practice on a non-square matrix.  express the transposition mathematically.  (mt)t = m. the transpose of a transpose is the original matrix.this is pretty intuitive, since all you're doing is switching the rows and columns.  flip square matrices over the main diagonal.  transpose a symmetric matrix.  start with a complex matrix.  take the complex conjugate.  transpose the results. 

 If you receive the ping report ping: cannot resolve example.com: Unknown host, it usually means that the you have misspelled the host name. Try another host name like “example.com”. If that reports “Unknown host,” then the problem is most likely the address of the domain name server.  If the problem is the address of the domain name server, ping using the host’s IP address instead of its name (e.g., 192.0.32.10). If this is successful then either the address you are using for the domain name server is incorrect or it is unreachable or down.   If you receive the ping report ping: sendto: No route to host, this may mean the address of the gateway is incorrect or that the connection from your computer is not up and running.  Ping 127.0.0.1 This is the IP address of your own computer. If this fails, the network configuration or the NIC (Network Interface Card) may be bad. Replace the NIC or add a new one.  If you are connected directly to your router, check the cable from your computer to your router, especially if the connection worked previously. If the Ethernet cable came loose, it could be causing the connection to fail.   If you are connecting wirelessly, ensure that you are properly connected to the network, and that the correct security password has been entered.  Most computer NIC ports have an indicator light that indicates a good connection and one that blinks as data is transferred. As the ping command transmits packets at about 1 per second, you should be able to see the data light blink.  Check that the router’s indicator light is lighting up properly (and no faults), including the one that indicates a good connection to your computer. If a fault indicator is on, follow the cable from your computer to the router to make sure it is properly connected, then call your cable or broadband provider if necessary.  

try another host name.  use the host’s ip address instead of its name.  ping your own computer.  check the network connection.  check the nic port's indicator light.  check the router. 

 All but the shortest haircuts can fit into a ponytail, and there are several different ways to make it look your own. Here are some options.; , For a sleek look, hold your hair about where you want it with one hand. With the other, carefully comb hair back into your hand, starting at your hairline and going all the way around your head. For a more tousled look, hang your hair upside down and muss it, using some light hairspray or a root lifter. Fasten without smoothing hair out.  Put your ponytail on the top of your head, at the nape of your neck, or somewhere in between.  Try positioning the ponytail just behind your ear, or make the shift more subtle by positioning it just a few inches to the right or left. Whatever you do, make sure it looks intentional - you don't want people to think you just couldn't get the ponytail straight.  If you have layers, bangs (fringe) or just want a less structured look, choose a few pieces at the top or side of your face to leave out of your ponytail. These can be curled, straightened, or just left as they are.  For a trendy mod look, make the top of your hair "bump" up before it goes back into the ponytail. Backcomb your hair where you want it to have some lift, and set with hairspray. You can also add a cute headband to a bump, placing it about a half-inch away from your hairline.  If you have long hair and a few bobby pins, you can mask the elastic used to fasten your ponytail. Pull a long, medium-width strand out of the bottom of the ponytail, near the center. Wrap it once around the base of the ponytail, over the elastic, and slip a bobby pin into it when it's back at the bottom. Wrap again, or as many times as you need to, and secure at the bottom again.  Grab the hair around the top of your head, leaving the bottom portion loose. Fasten with an elastic or barrette. This will keep your hair out of your face while maintaining a long, soft look.  Make your one ponytail into two ponytails, also known as pigtails. Be careful, though - while a ponytail is something women of all ages wear, pigtails are typically seen as being for teenage girls and younger, or costume occasions.         

try a ponytail.  make it neat or messy.  set it high or low.  move it to the side.  leave some pieces out.  add a bump.  hide the elastic.  do a half ponytail.  split into pigtails. 

 Do backbends, butterflies, along with leg and ankle stretches, too. When you're ready you can warm up by doing a couple standing back handsprings. Be careful: if you don't warm up, you could hurt your muscles.   After you get used to this, try to do round off twos. These exercises will help stretch you out and prepare your muscles for the standing back tuck.; , Research has proven that visualizing something helps in doing the same thing physically. So practicing a back flip in your mind would help you to do it physically., A spotter is someone, usually a trainer, coach, or experienced gymnast, who will help hold you and give you good posture while you try your first back tuck. Not only will they help you jump more into the air, but they'll also be able to give you great advice on anything you may be doing wrong, as well as safeguard against injury.  Mats ensure that any accidental falls won't be devastating for you. They're also a great psychological motivator: If you're not worried about falling down (don't worry, you shouldn't fall!) you'll jump higher and have better posture.    For beginners: try folding a mat up and standing on top of that for your first couple back tucks. This will give you a little extra space (you'll be higher than the ground) to do the back tuck in the air.  For advanced gymnasts: try jumping back onto a folded-up mat. Instead of having more space in the air to tuck and land, you'll have less. This is a great technique if you're already pretty good at tucking and want to improve your technique!  , Pretend that there's a string tied to each of your hands that's being pulled upwards. This will help you extend your arms all the way up and straighten out your body.  Before you do a back tuck, practice swinging your arms upward as you jump. This will give you the momentum you need to get high enough to actually do the back tuck.   Remember to jump up first and not backward. Many beginners believe that because the back tuck is a backward somersault in the air, they need to backward first. The proper technique for back tucks is jumping up first. This will give you the height needed to tuck your legs and then move backward.  Bring your legs nearly up to your chest as you jump upward. The momentum of bringing your legs into your chest will help make the backward jump much easier.   Try practicing the leg to chest tuck on the ground first. Lie down with your back on a mat and your arms up above your head, as they are in the starting position. (Have a spotter hold your arms there, or pin them underneath something heavy but still comfortable.) Then practice, as quickly as you can, lifting your legs up to your chest, simulating the same motion of the back tuck. Bring them up quickly and then back down, repeating.  You've bent your knees, jumped up, and then brought your knees into your chest while starting to lean back. If you can, try to make yourself small at the top of your jump.  Never land with straight knees. This will seriously hurt, and could put you at risk for hyperextended knees. Try to land with your knees bent so that they can absorb some of the shock of the landing.  Quickly get your balance by straightening your bent knees and thrusting your arms back up into the air. Your final stance should look almost identical to the way that you started.  That's pretty much how you do a back tuck. Not too hard, is it? After practicing all the small fundamentals — jumping, tucking, landing, snapping up — you should begin to get the feel for what a back tuck feels like as one fluid motion. Don't be afraid to work with a trainer or spotter in the early going; never attempt these tumbles alone if it's your first time.  

stretch out your muscles.  practice doing it in your mind.  get a spotter.  get a mat.  start with your arms up and your body completely straight.  lower your arms, bend your knees, and then swing your arms back up as you jump straight up into the air.  tuck your legs as you jump up into the air.  tuck yourself into a little ball in the middle of your mid-air jump.  land with your knees bent.  snap up with your body into starting position right after you land.  practice the whole thing by putting all the parts together. 

 Pour the milk into your stockpot and heat it over medium heat until it reaches an even temperature of 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32.2 degrees Celsius).You can use either cow's milk or goat's milk, but either way, it should be raw. The temperature can be as low as 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29.4 degrees Celsius) when you begin. Check the temperature with an instant-read food thermometer.; , Sprinkle the culture over the surface of the milk and whisk it in, making sure that it is thoroughly combined and dissolved.  Let the cultured milk ripen for 1 hour. Note that you could also use 1 packet of direct-set mesophilic culture instead of bulk mesophilic culture.  Slowly pour the diluted rennet into the milk, whisking continuously as you add it and for at least 5 minutes after all the rennet has been added.  Let the milk set for 1 to 2 hours. A curd should develop in this time, and it should be firm enough for you to cut cleanly with a knife. If you do not want to use liquid animal rennet, you could use 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) double-strength liquid vegetable rennet dissolved in 1/2 cup (125 ml) water or 1/4 tablet vegetable rennet dissolved in 1/2 cup (125 ml) water.  Use a long knife to cut the curds into 1/4-inch (6.5-mm) cubes. The cubes do not have to be perfectly even, but they should be approximately the same size.  Let the curds sit for an additional 15 minutes, or until they get a little firmer.  Gradually raise the temperature of the milk until it reaches 100 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 to 38.8 degrees Celsius). Stir the curds with a long-handled spoon every few minutes to prevent them from matting or clumping.  It will usually take about 30 to 45 minutes for the curds to reach this temperature. After the curds reach your desired temperature, let them continue to cook for another 30 to 45 minutes. Again, stir gently every few minutes to prevent matting. Remove the curds from the heat if they get too hot. During this time, the curds will begin to shrink considerably.  Place the colander in a large, clean sink or basin and line it with enough cheesecloth to cover the sides completely.  Meanwhile, let the curds settle to the bottom of the pot for about 20 minutes.  Pour the contents of the pot through your cheesecloth-lined colander. Rest the colander over a clean sink, basin, or the empty stockpot.  Drain for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the curds from becoming too clumpy or matted.   When you turn the curds out onto your cutting board, they should be semi-solid. The texture will resemble that of jelly or gelatin. Return the sliced curds to the dried, empty stockpot. Cover well with the lid or with aluminum foil.  The water should be about 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.8 degrees Celsius).  Make sure that the basin or sink is at least as deep as your stockpot, and fill it 1/2 to 2/3 full so that the part of the stockpot where the cheese rests will be completely submerged.  Place the stockpot in the basin, making sure that the water does not reach the lid or seep into the pot itself.  The curds need to be kept at a consistent temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius) for 2 hours. Refresh the water, if needed, to keep the contents of the stockpot hot. Turn the slices of cheese curd every 15 minutes. This process is known as "cheddaring," and it is thanks to this process that cheddar cheese has its trademark flavor.  Once the 2 hours pass, the curds should be very firm and have a slight shine to them. Remove them and cut the slices into 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) cubes.  Place the curds back in the stockpot once cubed.  Cover the stockpot and return it to the hot water. Let it sit in the hot water for another 30 minutes.  Make sure that the water is still 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.8 degrees Celsius). Stir the cheese curds with your fingers every 10 minutes during this stage.  Remove the pot from the hot water and add the salt. Stir it in gently using your hands.  The salt should completely coat the curds.  Place a clean piece of cheesecloth over the bottom of the cylinder compartment. The cheesecloth should be large enough to extend up to the top of the cylinder basin.  A home cheese press is all you need for this. These presses usually consist of a round cylinder, in which you will put the cheese, with guide rods on both sides. There should also be a pressure arm that allows you to change the amount of pressure applied to the cheese. Cheese presses are needed for the creation of hard cheeses, including cheddar cheese.  Place the curds in the bottom of the cheese press and wrap them up with the cheesecloth.  Crank the pressure arm until the gauge indicates that you are applying 10 lbs (4.5 kg) of pressure. Let the cheese sit in the cheese press for 15 minutes at this pressure.  Increase the pressure to 40 lbs (18 kg) and press for 12 hours.  Flip the cheese over and change the cheesecloth to a fresh piece before continuing to press the cheese.  Bump up the pressure to 50 lbs (22.5 kg) and press for an additional 24 hours.  Flip the cheese over and change the cheesecloth to a fresh piece before continuing to press the cheese.  Remove the cheese from the cheese press after the 24 hours pass. Place it on a cheese board and let it dry for 2 to 5 days.  The cheese should dry at room temperature. Keep it in a fairly light, dry location and away from excess humidity or moisture. The exact amount of time it takes to dry the cheese will vary depending on how humid the air is. When ready, the cheese should be dry to the touch. It should have also developed a protective rind.   Prepare the cheese for waxing by wiping the surface with a small piece of cheesecloth dipped in white vinegar. This will get rid of any visible or unseen mold. Chill the cheese in your refrigerator for a few hours before you apply the wax. Remove a 4-inch by 4-inch (10-cm by 10-cm) piece of cheese wax. Place the cheese wax in the top part of a double boiler and fill the bottom with water. Heat it over medium heat until it melts and reaches about 210 degrees Fahrenheit (98.9 degrees Celsius). Dip a natural bristle brush into the melted wax and coat the wheel of cheese with the wax, working with one surface at a time. Let the wax on one surface cool before waxing another surface. You should apply at least two coats of wax over the entire surface. Let dry completely.  Place the cheese in your refrigerator and store it there for at least 60 days before enjoying.  The cheese should ideally sit at a temperature between 55 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit (12.8 to 15.6 degrees Celsius). If you prefer a sharper flavor, age the cheese for 3 to 24 months. The longer you age the cheese within this time frame, the sharper the flavor will be. Ages and flavors:  Mild: 3-4 months Sharp 4-12 months Extra Sharp 2 years Older cheeses are just referred to by age    

heat the milk in a large stockpot.  mix in the mesophilic culture.  add the rennet solution.  cut the curds into cubes.  raise the temperature and continue cooking.  line a colander with cheesecloth.  drain the whey.  turn the curds out onto a cutting board.cut them into five evenly-sized slices.  fill a basin with hot water.  place the pot in the hot water.  cut the slices into cubes.  return to the hot water.  add salt.  line the cheese press with cheesecloth.  add the cheese and press for 15 minutes.  increase the pressure and continue pressing.  increase the pressure once more and continue pressing.  let the cheese air dry.  wax your cheddar cheese.cheese wax prevents hard cheeses, like cheddar, from drying out and growing mold as they age.  let the cheese age in your refrigerator.

 Get rid of useless clothes, old papers, and broken things that you're not planning to fix. Donate any items that might still be usable to someone else, and throw out or recycle the rest.   When you're going through your clothes, actually try them on. It'll take a while but it's the only way to remember whether older clothes are worth keeping. Yes, you might have loved that shirt from five years ago, but if it doesn't fit and doesn't have extreme sentimental value, there's no reason to keep it anymore. Even if it does fit you, consider whether you've worn it in the last year. If not and if you're not about to wear it tomorrow, find it a new home through donation, and let someone else love it from here on out.  In simpler terms: put everything away when you're not using it. If every bit of clothing or other personal item has a "home", staying organized is easy. It's a lot of work to set up, but once you know which drawer houses your socks, which part of the closet is for shirts, and where your trousers go, it's easy to stick to it.  Once of the biggest sources of mess in people's rooms is dirty clothes. Get a big hamper or basket for dirty clothes, and every time you take something off that you don't plan on wearing again before you wash it, throw it right in there, rather than on the floor. Once the hamper is full (or even before), do a load of laundry. When the laundry is done, put the clothes away right away. Skipping the steps where dirty clothes clutter up the floor or clean clothes are sitting around waiting to be put away will help everything feel much more organized.  Some people love having a lot of sentimental mementos in their rooms. It's not exactly minimalist, but it's okay, as long as you keep them somewhat tidy and clean. Clean them every now and then so that they don't accumulate a lot of fluff and dust, and they'll only enhance your room.  Ok, everyone accumulates a fair share of junk that doesn't "fit" with other supplies. Designate one drawer or box/shelf in your closet for these items that don't "go" with anything else. Every few months, look through it and throw out what you don't need. Junk has a way of accumulating!  

sort out your clutter.  use your drawers, wardrobes, and built-in closets religiously.  do laundry regularly.  organize your trinkets and ornaments.  consider having a "junk" drawer or box.

 Your mindset or attitude is an important part of your mood. That is, you can't always change a situation you're in, but you can change how you react to it. You have to start by identifying what you're feeling currently.For instance, maybe you had a bad interview for a job. You can identify your feelings as sad or angry, depending on what you're feeling.; , Once you've established what mood you're already in, think about what mood would be better. To help you decide, focus on what kind of mood would help you move forward, rather than stay stuck where you are.For instance, if you did badly on an interview, you may decide that a better mood would be confidence that you will do better next time by learning from your mistakes. While you can't instantly change to a new mood, deciding what mood would be better can help push you in the right direction.  When you're in a bad mood, you're likely only looking at what went wrong. However, if you can find the positive in the situation, you'll help change your mood.This step can be as simple as looking for the things in your life that you're grateful for or looking for what you can be grateful for, even in a situation that you think isn't great. For instance, if you've had a bad job interview, at least you have the qualifications and the resources to apply for those jobs., Basically, just tell yourself that you can and will do better. It's like a friend giving you a pep talk, but you're doing it for yourself.For instance, in the case of the interview, you could say, "That didn't go as well as you hoped, but you'll do so much better next time. Plus, at least you didn't bomb it completely. You showed up on time, and you were dressed in a professional manner. Plus, you rocked that question about your future goals!", Sunlight can naturally improve your mood, especially over time. If you work in a dark environment or stay in the house all day, try spending some time outside.If you can't get outside, try opening the windows to let the light in. If you live in an area that is darker in the winter, you might try getting a lamp meant to offer the same benefits as sunlight.  Exercise is a natural mood-lifter. When you exercise, your body releases mood-lifting endorphins into your bloodstream.Even if you don't have time for an hour-long workout everyday, adding exercise to your routine can help, too. For instance, take the stairs instead of the elevator if you can or park farther out when you go to the store., Getting out and spending time with people you like can also boost your mood. If you don't have many friends, try joining a club that focuses on a hobby you love.Try connecting with people on the internet through social media, who you can then meet up with in real life. You can also meet people at social events such as open mic nights at your local coffee shop.  If you're sitting alone in your house brooding, it may be time to get out. Go to the park. Enjoy a coffee at a coffee shop. Stop by the library or bookstore. Pick a place that makes you feel better, and spend an hour or two lifting your mood., Pick some music that always energizes you. Put it in a playlist, and blast it across your room or house. Spending some time listening to music that makes you happy can lift your mood.If you can't decide what to listen to, many social music sites have playlists made by users for certain moods. For instance, you could find a list meant to be energizing or make you happier.  When you are in a bad mood, try engaging in something that interests you. Learning something new, which engages your creativity and interest, can help boost your mood.One place to explore ideas is your local libraries. Try checking out books on some topics you love.  

identify your mindset.  decide what mood would be better.  look for the positive.  give yourself a pep talk.  get into the sunlight.  go for a walk.  enjoy time with other people.  get in a better environment.  play some happy music.  find out about things that interest you. 

 The ideal height for this shrub is between 6 and 10 feet, because this height allows it to be full, lush, and compact.   Always use sharp hand pruners when pruning this shrub. Even if it is grown as a hedge, hedge shears should not be used. They tend to shred the leaves. Find a growth bud on the stem that is located at a height of 6 feet (1.8 m) or less. If it has not reached its mature height yet, the stem can be cut down to about two-thirds its current height. Make the cut at an angle just above the growth bud.  While Tardiva is a young shrub, it does not need to be cut back drastically to reduce its height.   A light pruning is all that is necessary. It will keep the shrub more compact and encourage additional new stem growth which means more beautiful hydrangea flowers. Make the cuts at an angle above a growth bud with sharp pruners, but find a growth bud that is not very far down on the stem.  Older Tardiva hydrangeas sometimes need serious pruning to help them look their best.   This type of pruning is called rejuvenation pruning because it does, in a sense, rejuvenate an old bush. Cut one-third of the oldest stems right off at the base in winter or early spring each year for three consecutive years. The height of the remaining stems can be reduced by one-third each year as well to help reduce the overall size of the shrub. In the fourth year, most of the stems will be new and the shrub will be full-looking.  Dead branches should be removed completely and immediately, as soon as the dead branch is noticed.   This can be done at any time of year. When doing your annual pruning in the winter or early spring, cut out any branches that are growing at odd angles and crossing other branches. These branches can rub against other branches, causing wounds that open the shrub up to disease and boring insects.  

maintain a height of 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3.0 m) to achieve ideal growth.  refrain from excessively pruning young shrubs to maintain a compact shrub.  prune older hydrangeas to rejuvenate them.  remove dead or odd-growing branches to tidy up your shrub. 

 Just as there isn't a clear step-by-step process to win everyone over, there's no one way to dress well. This open-endedness isn't a bad thing. Rather, there are endless possibilities through which you can express yourself. Aim to dress to suit the occasion you're taking part of, whether it's a wedding, funeral, or weekend party. For more general circumstances, it's a good idea to take a look at the clothes you currently wear and ask yourself what kind of impression that would give across to someone who saw you on the street.   You don't need to follow current fashion trends, but it does help to check up some of the more recent styles for inspiration in finding your own look. This includes making sure your clothes are freshly laundered regularly, especially if you're on the brink of a high-priority meeting like a first date or job interview.; , Improper sleep has a list of bad effects on you and your body. You'll never be in your best mood without proper rest, and your body will look drained and pale. It's recommended you try to get at least 7 hours of sleep each night. Although this may be difficult to accomplish for some, there are lots of things you can do to improve on your sleep. Avoid caffeine and stay away from electronics in the hour before getting to sleep if you can., Remember to attend to basics. This includes trimming your nails, brushing your hair, brushing your teeth at least twice a day, and showering regularly.   Keeping up with hygiene's especially important if you have a physically strenuous lifestyle.  A solid posture and assertive stance make you naturally look more powerful and reliable. On the other hand, being slouched over will have a negative reaction from whomever sees you like that. Positive body language also has a benefit on your self-confidence.   Smiling is a universal tool for sending positive feelings. There are numerous benefits for both smiling and being smiled at.Don't forget to smile whenever you meet someone for the first time. Strong eye contact is essential. Make sure you're looking directly at whomever you're talking to.  Even if there's a lot of nagging self-doubt, confidence is necessary if you want to maximize your chances at winning people over. Having a firm belief in yourself is something that goes over well with practically everyone. When you have confidence, other things like charm and collectedness fall into place like clockwork.   Try asking some of your friends some good things they like about you. Even if you find yourself clouded in self-doubt, they'll probably see a much better version of you. If you think it will help, make up a list of ten things you like about yourself or are proud of. Don't be modest on your list and don't underrate the things you've already accomplished in your life. Once you have a full list of things you have to offer other people, you'll be able to look at it and be reminded of everything you have to offer the world.  Gratitude is a reminder that the person thinks highly of whomever they're talking to and sincerely appreciates all they do. If someone does something for you, make sure to thank them for it. You should always thank someone for their time after meeting them for the first time. Time itself is valuable, and the other person will be made to feel special.   Make sure the way you're expressing gratitude is appropriate to what you're being thankful for. For example, if someone has held open a door for you, a simple "thank you" usually suffices. On the other hand, if you've recently been offered a great raise by your employer, a more in-depth thank you (such as a written letter) may be more appropriate.  They don't try to hide what they're feeling. Emotional expressiveness also allows you to relate to the other person on more than just a mental level. Don't be afraid to let feeling come into whatever you're talking about. So long as it's kept within appropriate boundaries, everyone likes a person who sounds passionate or moved but the thing they're talking about.   Especially if you're meeting someone, you should probably limit your range of emotions to the positive-leaning end of the spectrum. Coming off as an angry or embittered person isn't likely going to win somebody over.  A lot of research shows that people have a hard time being charmed by those they think are out of their league. A lot of the most charming movie actors have traits that are otherwise completely normal, and this is why they are so appealing.If you want to win someone over, you shouldn't try to give the impression that you're somehow completely better than them. Your best bet is to find common ground. Make yourself relatable to the person they're talking to. Even if you're coming from opposite backgrounds, make it sound like the other person is talking to an equal.  Instead, people tend to feel endeared towards people who aren't afraid to show their weak points. There is a difference between this and dwelling on your failures. People don't like a sob story. You want to show these vulnerabilities while all the while expressing confidence and security. This proves to others that you are bigger than any of your weaknesses.   Any character flaw can improve if you put your heart to it. There is a world of differences between someone who likes to relax and someone lazy. Some good weaknesses, per example, would be being clumsy or having a soft heart towards kitten. Self-deprecating humour is a good way to express vulnerability without making it seem like you're dwelling on the negative. By turning something touchy into an excuse to make other people laugh, you can show people you're stronger than your insecurities.  Once you've won someone over, it's another thing entirely to keep that relationship healthy and afloat.Making connections takes charm, while keeping them healthy takes trust and understanding. Once you have a bond with someone, it's important to let each other in on the details of your lives as if you were still just getting to know each other. In this way, a friendship or relationship will continue to grow.  If you have won someone over, you can do a lot to make your ties stronger by winning at things together. If there's a contest you're going to take part of, it doesn't hurt to bring this person into it as well.   On the other hand, you can set parallel goals and keep one another accountable for their own. For instance, if the two of you have a weight loss goal, you can keep each other motivated by telling the other how much you've lost and what you're doing to get there.  No doubt it makes you feel a lot better when someone gives you affection. The same works both ways. Make sure to return affection when it's given by someone you care about. This may be a difficult thing to do at first if you're a naturally cold person, but the benefits will be apparent for you as much as the other person. Research shows that people are happier when they regularly express gratitude and affection for people they care about.If affection doesn't come naturally to you, you should try to mirror the affection that's been given to you. For example, if someone smiles, it is generally good form to return the smile. Make sure you feel the affection as sincerely as the other person does. If you're trying to force returned affection, it will seem like you're being condescending.  Patience is a necessary virtue for practically all relationships. If you've developed a meaningful connection with someone, you'll need to acknowledge that there will be times where communication might be slow.Life events can take their toll on a person, and limit the amount you'll get to see them. Don't take the changes personally. Accept the fact that everyone changes over time, and be patient towards the challenges that may create.

Garlic has a sulfuric enzyme called alliin that helps protect against viruses. Garlic is best taken as a raw clove to release alliin.   To make it more edible, crush the garlic into a spoonful of honey or olive oil.

There are several licorice root pills and serums you can take You can also eat one to five grams of real licorice root. Look for candy licorice with a main ingredient of licorice root, not anise or licorice flavoring.   An alternative to simply eating the licorice is to make a licorice tea. Soak one to five grams of licorice sticks in a cup of boiling water. Let it steep for three to five minutes, then strain and drink once every week.

For example, if you intend to use a 15W device for 2 hours a day, that's 15W x 2h = 30Wh. Note, however, that ratings are usually higher than the actual power consumption. To determine how much a device actually draws, you can use a meter like the Kill-a-Watt. Once you have all the Watt-hours, add them up. If the total exceeds 1000Wh (or 1 Kilowatt-hour), this How to may not be suitable for you.; , Unobstructed literally means that there are no shadows. If a tree, neighboring building, or anything else casts a shadow in that particular spot, don't count the time during which a shadow exists. So, if you get 12 hours of sunlight, but the sun is beyond the fence for 2 hours in the morning, then behind a tree for an hour at noon, then shadowed by your neighbor's barn for 2 hours before sunset, you only get to count 7 hours. Note also that days are shorter in Winter. If you intent to use your set up in Winter, use your Winter hours.  If you decide you need 600Wh and that you get 6h of sunlight, that's 600Wh / 6h = 100W. This is the amount of power you need to generate per hour of sunlight to meet your needs. To be safe, multiply that by at least 2 or more. This is to account for the fact that solar panels only generate their rated output when pointed directly at the sun, and if your solar panels are fixed, they won't be facing directly at the sun most of the time. After various inefficiencies, you may lose another 20% or more of the power generated. If you expect regular and sustained cloud coverage, you may need to multiply by 5 or more (or simply reduce consumption to live within your means).  Broadly speaking, there are 3 types of solar panels (strictly speaking, photovoltaic cells): amorphous silicon, polycrystalline, and monocrystalline. Amorphous silicon panels are relatively inexpensive, relatively unaffected by small shadows, but are very inefficient in terms of space (for the same power rating, amorphous silicon panels will be larger and heavier). Polycrystalline panels are more efficient, cheaper than monocrystalline, but also less efficient. Monocrystalline panels are the most efficient, but also the most expensive. Output from mono- and polycrystalline panels can be halved or less by even a tiny shadow because of the way individual cells are wired. Mono- and poly-crystalline panels can be purchased these days can under $1 per Watt., While some people want their panels to last 25 years, the reality is that the cost of PV cells are coming down so rapidly that replacing or augmenting your panels in another 5-10 years may actually be cheaper than paying more now for ones that last longer. If the solar panels are more expensive than your budget allows, consider lowering your power consumption. Turning off or forgoing some devices won't kill you (and if it will, this How to is not for you).Calculate the amount of battery capacity you need. To do this, take the power consumption estimated in Step 1, then double it, because only about half the batteries' capacity should be considered usable to avoid over-discharge. Then, multiply by the number of days' reserve you would like. For instance, if you want to use 600Wh, you need 1200Wh (or 1.2kWh) of capacity, so if you had 3.6kWh, you'll be good for a few days even if the sun disappears (though you may have other problems at that point). Since most batteries have capacities in Amp-hours, it may be best to convert Wh to Ah. To do so, divide the capacity you calculated by the battery's voltage, so 3600Wh / 12V = 300Ah (divide by 6 for 6V batteries).  While normal car batteries will work (for a while), it is best to use "deep-cycle" batteries, which are generally marketed for use in RVs and boats. Some people prefer 6V golf cart batteries, which are designed to withstand repeated deep discharges. If using 6V batteries, connect two in series (positive terminal of one connects to negative of the other), then connect pairs in parallel (positive of one pair with positive of the other pair, negative with negative). If your budget allows, you may consider AGM batteries, which can take more "abuse", but also cost 2-3x what lead acid batteries cost. Make sure the Ah ratings of all batteries added together is higher than the capacity you calculated in the previous step. If using multiple batteries, make sure to get multiples of the same battery, and to get them all new (or reconditioned) at the same time. Mixing different capacity, model, or age batteries can shorten all of their lifespans.  Charge controllers can cost as little as $10 or over $100. The most important thing is to actually use a charge controller. If you hook up solar panels directly to some batteries, the batteries will charge for a while, but they could quickly be ruined. Whichever charge controller you get needs to support the amount of current your solar panels produce. Most charge controllers are rated in Amps, so divide the Watt rating of your solar panels by 12V (e.g. 200W / 12V ~= 17A). Find a charge controller with a rating higher than your theoretical estimate. This will give you a safety margin, as well as some headroom for growth in the future. Beyond that, exactly which charge controller to buy is basically a trade-off between cost vs efficiency and battery-life. The more expensive charge controllers will use different charging algorithms best suited to the type of battery you have. They also may compensate for temperature to better protect your batteries.  use normal wall plugs), you will also need an inverter. There are broadly two types of inverters: modified sine wave and pure sine wave. Pure sine wave inverters give you power that is closer to city power, but these inverters tend to be more expensive ($150+ for a 600W inverter). Modified sine wave inverters can be much cheaper ($30+ for a 400W inverter), but some devices may not work, or work well with them. Note also that inverters have 80-90% efficiency, which means you lose some power in the DC to AC conversion. However, if you've followed all previous steps as recommended, your set-up should have the excess capacity to absorb this inefficiency.  

decide how much power you need.  determine how much unobstructed sunlight you receive in the location you intend to set up solar panels.  divide your total power consumption from step 1 by the number of hours you came up with in step 2.  buy solar panels.  consider "b-grade" panels which are significantly cheaper, yet come with reasonable warranties.  buy batteries.  buy a charge controller.  if you plan on running devices off of ac power (i.e. 

 of olive oil in a non-stick frying pan. A medium-sized pan is best. Heat the pan on medium heat until the oil warms up a bit, which should take 2 minutes. You can substitute butter for olive oil if that's what you prefer.; , Most orzo comes packaged in one-pound boxes, so use half the box.  You will want to lightly brown the pasta to give it a nutty flavor. This will take 2-5 minutes, depending on the heat. If it starts getting too dark too fast, take it off the stove. You want it to be toasted—not burnt.  Pour in 1 cup at first, and then add the rest as time goes on so the rice absorbs it. You can stop after 1 1/2 cups if you'd like the orzo to be less creamy. The orzo will absorb the chicken broth similarly to the way rice would absorb the broth.  Then, reduce the heat to low and simmer the orzo and broth mixture for 10-15 minutes, or until the orzo is tender and has absorbed all of the broth.   Sometimes you will find the orzo has absorbed the broth, but is still a bit tough. In that case, just add a bit more broth or water to the pan and keep cooking.  Serve this tasty orzo on its own or eat it as a side dish with a main course like chicken or beef.  

pour 4 tbsp.  add ½ pound of orzo to the pan.  stir the orzo into the oil with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula.  pour in 2 cups of chicken broth.  turn up the heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil.  serve. 

 Facial cysts, medically referred to as sebaceous cysts, can be annoying and unsightly but they don't necessarily require medical intervention. If the cyst is not painful, it might be best to leave it alone to avoid complications having it removed. However, you should see a doctor if any of the following develop:   Facial cysts are usually small, round lumps just underneath the skin. They may be black, reddish or yellowish, and occasionally release foul-smelling discharge. Cysts are generally more painful than other skin conditions, such as pimples.If the cyst ruptures, this can lead to a potentially dangerous boil-like infection. Prompt treatment and removal is required.If the cyst suddenly becomes painful and swollen, it may be infected. See a doctor to get the cyst removed and get the proper antibiotics.In very rare cases, a cyst can lead to skin cancer. During your regular annual doctor's exam, ask your doctor to look at the cyst and determine if it poses a risk for cancer.; , If the cyst is infected or painful, your doctor can inject the cyst with a medication. While this will not fully remove the cyst, it will reduce redness and swelling. This can make the cyst less noticeable., If the cyst grows significantly or becomes painful and uncomfortable, you can have it medically removed. The cyst can be cut open and drained by your doctor.   The doctor will make a small cut in the cyst and gently drains out the built up fluid. The procedure is fairly quick and usually not painful.The major downside to this method is that cysts often reoccur after being lanced and drained., The only way to fully remove a cyst is through surgery. Talk to your doctor about undergoing surgery if you want a cyst removed.   Cyst removal surgery is minor. It does not take very long and recovery time is relatively brief. However, you may have to return to your doctor's office after the surgery to remove any stitches.Surgery is very safe and usually prevents cysts from occurring. However, cysts do not usually pose a medical threat. Therefore it may be difficult to get surgery covered by insurance. 

decide if medical intervention is necessary.  ask your doctor for an injection.  have the cyst drained.  ask about surgery. 

 Turn your jeans inside out to preserve the color on them and ensure that the inside gets cleaned thoroughly., Close off the stopper in your bathtub before filling it up. When running the faucet, make sure the water is cold. Push the jeans down under the water so that they are fully saturated. Hot water can cause your jeans to fade or shrink. If you don't have a bathtub, you can use a large plastic bin.  You can use a simple soap or a light detergent to clean your jeans. Look for detergents that are meant for delicate clothing if you want to preserve the color in your jeans., Swirl the jeans around in the soap and water mixture until suds start to form on the top. Once you're done, allow them to soak for up to an hour before coming back to dry them.  Make sure to rinse off all the soap suds created by the soap or detergent before drying them off. Run them under cold water until the water runs clear.  Rolling your jeans between two towels will soak up the remaining moisture in your jean. Press down on towels once the jeans are rolled up so that the towel absorbs the water before unrolling it., Hang your jeans up outside or in a breezy place inside of your house. After drying, the jeans may be stiff. Wear them for 20-30 minutes to loosen them up.  

turn your jeans inside out.  submerge your jeans in cold water.  add a light detergent to the water.  allow the jeans to soak for 30 minutes to an hour.  rinse your jeans off.  lay your jeans in between two towels and roll them up.  hang your jeans up to dry overnight. 

 Most bake sales are for raising money for a charity or cause. Be sure you and your customers understand who or what you are raising money for. Have posters or other advertising materials. It may help to make pamphlets or other media presentations available to explain your charity. This is a great opportunity to promote your cause, too.Put out a jar for tips or donations. If you are raising money for a cause, give people the opportunity to donate without buying. Some people may not be hungry, or cannot buy sweets due to dietary restrictions, but they still might want to support your organization. Make sure you know how to send your profits to your charity.; , Get your friends and family to help. If this is a fundraiser for a school, get the students involved. Let the kids have the option of participating in the fundraiser by baking goods with their parents to sell in the bake sale, and give them appropriate responsibilities.Make clear what the cause is, when the bake sale is, and have reasonable shifts available. How many volunteers you will need will depend on the size of your proposed bake sale. A small bake sale may be easily handled by one experienced volunteer. However, a large bake sale may need several people to coordinate helping customers, the cash box, setting up and taking down, and baking. You might want to make one person in charge of organizing the volunteer bakers, one person in charge of renting the venue and the equipment needed, and one person in charge of publicizing the event.  Generally, you want to be in a high traffic area. For instance, have your bake sale at a well-frequented public spot or in a school or college. If the bake sale is for your school, ask the Student Union, administration, or other appropriate staff for possible venues on the school grounds.Sometimes retail stores will be happy to have a booth set up nearby. Community events, such as festivals and special events like street fairs, outdoor public concerts, and other big public events are all excellent choices. At schools, plays, concerts, open houses, sporting events, parent nights are excellent bake sale opportunities. Make sure that it is legal to hold at the spot you choose, and get permission from the appropriate authorities, if applicable. Be sure you have a "rain site" to do the bake sale indoors or under a tent in case the weather turns sour.  You may be lucky and have a table and chairs available already and a sign made up already--especially if this is a yearly event. But if you do not, you will need to plan ahead. You may need:   Booths or tables Card tables or folding tables Some sort of awning, like a pop-up pavilion or gazebo to protect from rain or sun Tablecloths Decorations and signs to grab attention A cooler and ice to keep items like drinks cold A garbage container and garbage bags for cleanup Folding chairs Crock pots to keep liquid items warm A cash box. You need to keep your funds in some sort of container. Be sure it has change for large bills!  , The best way to ensure a large number of potential customers at your bake sale is to have it coincide with another event. Or, if your bake sale is for your school, make sure you have it during a time when the greatest number of parents and kids can attend, such as a weekday evening. Some ideas for events to place your bake sale near include: elections, PTA events, school games, and community events.You will also want to make sure your date is in the sweet spot between being so soon that not enough people hear about and so far that people forget about it. Somewhere around two weeks from when you announce it should work., Make sure you assign your volunteer bakers certain items to make through something like a sign up list, so you don't wind up with too many of some goods, and not enough of others.   If many people in an organization are baking, ask them to package things in sale-size quantities, perhaps two to three cookies to a package or one cupcake or larger item.  Give the volunteer bakers a specific method for packaging their finished goods. It's a good idea to have every item individually wrapped in plastic wrap or a plastic bag, to avoid contamination that might cause allergic reactions.  All the goods should have the ingredients listed. Many people (especially children) have food allergies and sensitivities and dietary preferences. Providing a list of ingredients help people stay healthy and happy while supporting you. Knowing that a cookie has nuts in it or not may make a big difference.   An index card by the dish is an easy way to do this. You can also put sticky labels on plastic bags. Marking items with common allergens can be helpful (tree nuts, strawberries, peanuts, etc.). Also mark foods which may be a good choice for certain people, such as gluten-free brownies, Kosher treats, vegan cookies, or nut-free items.  Try to include some healthy options too, instead of just cupcakes and pie. Not everything has to be sugary at a bake sale. Fresh homemade bread, pretzels, and corn muffins can sell too., Remember, it is a bake sale, so you don't have to get too caught up in the money as long as it is for a good cause. Optionally, you can even opt not to set any prices at all, except something like a $1 minimum, and let people pay what they want on the "honor system"., Decide who is going to do what once you start the event. Delegate people to retrieve and set up the equipment, someone to organize the goods and volunteers once they arrive, and someone to keep track of the money.Invite your friends that will contribute and try hard. Make sure you have an adult around so if you need any help, they'll be there to help.  If you live in a suburb, consider moving the sale to the corner of your street, or to the front of the neighborhood. Move your set up to the reasonable area., Design attention-grabbing and colorful media with the date, time, place and cause being supported. Design and share posters online or put paper ones up in well frequented areas.If you are selling at a school, have your bake sale announced over an intercom, in the daily notice or school paper, or whatever is available. Advertise your organization through your clothes. If you are raising funds for your scout troop, for instance, wear your uniform.  Bake sales are a good opportunity to bake a variety of goodies. A bake sale needs baked items, which ideally will be homemade. Have all your baking volunteers bake the goods the day before the sale, to ensure maximum freshness.You could bake the items yourself and this is usually the cheapest way. Divide the baking between many members, if possible. Alternatively, buy them from a local bakery or shop. This is particularly effective if people don't usually have access to such goods, such as at a high school. It also is easier for people who can't cook, or don't have the time.  A lot of people like to have a bit of liquid to wash down sugary treats, and it is an additional chance for you or your group to earn a bit of extra money.   Coffee, tea, iced tea, lemonade, water, and soda are all good options. However, use common sense: hot coffee probably will not sell well on a hot summer day.  Set up the tables, donation box, and signs. Keep track of all the volunteers arriving, and let them each know where they should set up their goods. Bring a supply of small paper plates, paper towels, plastic forks, napkins, cups if you are serving drinks that require them, and plastic wrap, bags, or foil. It's best to keep these to a minimum, as they cut into profits and create waste.All these tasks can be delegated to some of your team members. Don't try to stretch your own efforts too thin by putting yourself in charge of too many tasks.  Double check that everyone is where they should be, and all the tables are full of delicious baked goods, and start selling. If you planned it well enough, this should be the easiest step of all. Consider getting some music going to make the atmosphere more fun and welcoming.Have a cash box and start with a reasonable amount of change in it. Write down the amount so you can calculate how much you've earned at the end. Keep the cash box safe throughout the event. Thank the customers for their support as they leave the event.  "Hey! How are you? Try some delicious treats for a low price!" If the customer decides to buy a cupcake for example, consider packaging it in a cute cardboard box., Have a specific time when the event will end. Once it reaches that time, politely let everyone know that the bake sale is wrapping up. Let all the customers currently buying goods finish before you start packing up.   Once the event is over, count the money earned and thank all the volunteers for their help. Help them pack up their unsold goods.  Be courteous and leave your area as clean or cleaner than you found it. Remove all the tables, chairs, and other equipment rented for the event. Clean up and throw away all the trash. Ask some of the volunteers to help you with this., Let the volunteers know that they are of course free to take their leftover goods home with them, but also provide an option for them to donate their unsold baked goods. Contact a local food shelter or nursing home and ask them if they would like to take your unsold goods. Then ask one of the volunteers to deliver the goods, or do it yourself, as soon as possible, so they're still fresh. 

have a cause.  make your team.  decide on a venue.  get all the equipment you need.  decide on the time.  assign the baking work.  give instructions on how to pack the goods.  give instructions on what to label on the packaging.  have a variety of types of baked goods.  set reasonable prices.  coordinate the work.  decide on an area you'd like to sell at.  publicize the event.  make the goods.  get drinks to sell as well.  set up the event.  get the party going.  be polite when greeting the customer.  end the event.  leave the area clean.  send the leftovers somewhere. 

 Since researchers -- including historians, sociologists, journalists, lawyers, and political scientists -- are the primary archival users, understanding the research process and knowing what sort of sources could be useful can make you a more effective archivist. The best way to develop strong research and writing skills is to earn a degree in history, English, sociology, or another research and writing-intensive major.You could also sharpen your writing skills by publishing a blog about a topic you are interested in but know little about. Since it can be difficult or impossible to objectively evaluate the quality of your own research and writing, show your work to strong writers and ask for feedback. Join a writing club in your area (preferably one that focuses on nonfiction writing) to connect with others who can help you develop strong research and writing abilities. Strong research and writing skills can help you draft useful finding aids -- the guides that let archival users know what the archive contains.  Having a special area of knowledge can make you more attractive for archival institutions. These specializations are both topical and format-based. Topical specializations include advanced knowledge of a particular collections area such as labor, Asian-American history, modern British culture, ecology, and so on. Format-based archival specialization includes familiarity with a particular type of archival material, including photographs, digital records, cassette tapes, and so on.   The utility of a particular specialization is impossible to gauge, since each archival institution has different collections policies and needs.  While professional certification is not always necessary to obtain work as an archivist, it certainly enhances your resume. The particular process by which you obtain certification depends on the certifying organization.Generally, however, you will need to register for a certification exam and pay an application fee. The specific areas of archival science on the certification exam vary depending on the organization. Take advantage of online study guides provided by the certifying organization to identify the topics the exam addresses. If possible, take sample exams in order to familiarize yourself with the sorts of questions you’ll encounter. Professional certification might not be offered year round. Contact the certifying organization for more information about when and where you can take the certification exam.  Many archives contain documents in foreign languages. While the applicability of this skill depends on the institution to which you apply for work, if you know that you are interested in working in an archive that deals largely or primarily with foreign-language documents, learn to read that language. 

sharpen your research and writing skills.  select a specialization.  obtain professional certification.  learn a foreign language. 

 It is not easy to get involved in the music world, even for children. It's roughly estimated that it takes 10,000 hours of practicing to become truly proficient in a skill, and singing is no exception.This will probably mean sacrificing a lot of time doing other things, like hanging out with friends, playing video games, and pursuing other hobbies. So you have to really ask and decide for yourself if you really want to make this commitment.   You will probably face a lot of competition and roadblocks. Even after you become successful, you may not see a lot of profit at first, and there will likely continue to be a lot of work involved, like signing autographs for hours, traveling for tours, having to write and rewrite melodies and lyrics, long nights at the studio, etc. Although it is a very glamorous and rewarding job, it is not always easy.; , You should find out more information about what other modern child singers' experiences have been like in order to understand what the process is like, and how long it will be like. You will also want to start researching to see what kind of music you want to sing.   Pick a particular person you admire, like Aaron Carter or Charlotte Church. Use a search engine like Google, Bing, or Yahoo to find interviews and articles written about their careers. Try search terms like "Name Interview," "Name on Success," or "Name music industry." Try finding the artist's Wikipedia page by searching for them at Wikipedia or any search engine. Scroll to the bottom and look in the "References" section for articles hosted online for interviews and other articles about their career history. Go to your local library and ask a librarian for help finding more information about the music industry and child singers; they should be able to help you locate biographies and autobiographies for current and past famous individuals.  Maybe you already think you know what style of music you want to sing, or maybe you have no clue, but you should make sure you know which genre you want to pursue. It would be a waste of time and energy to think you want to be a country singer only to realize three years into training that you want to sing in the opera some day. Research all kinds of different artists and genres of music by listening to them to discover what you like, and what sounds you think you can envision your voice contributing to.   Try web services like Last.fm or Musicovery to build your own radio station that features songs that match your taste or mood. Try Earbits Radio's web service or surfing your local radio stations on a car radio for different music genres. Ask your parents and grandparents to introduce you to music they enjoy; it's probably very different than what you and your friends like to listen to.  "Successful" is a really vague word, and it could mean a lot of things, especially in today's day and age where there are many paths to choose from. Do you want to be an internet sensation? Do you want to sign onto a record label and perform all over the country? Do you want to star in Broadway or go onto a career in the opera someday? The answers to these questions will determine the kind of training you will need to pursue.  In addition to being time-demanding, in order to pursue this career you will need money. There will be things you need to purchase and invest in along the way like training, equipment, and clothes. It will also be emotionally demanding, since you may have to face rejection, criticism, and other difficulties. There are also things that you may not be able to do for yourself as a minor, like driving yourself to auditions or signing legal paperwork. You are going to need the support of your parents or legal guardians in order to pursue this career.  Because becoming a singer will be a lot of work for both you and your parents, you need to show them you have put a lot of thought into this decision despite your young age. If you simply say, "I think it will be a lot of fun," they may come up with counter arguments like, "But do you know how much time and energy this will take?" You will need to use the research you did before to prove to them you know what you're talking about.   Try treating this like writing a persuasive essay. If you can think of all of the bad reasons someone could come up with, then you can think of good reasons and arguments to oppose those bad reasons. Be sure to back it up with facts when possible. So, if your parents say "You won't be able to spend time with your friends," you can say, "I can join the school or church choir and make friends that share my passion for singing." Rehearse your argument to yourself. You will want to make sure you remember your points for when you have a discussion with them.  Having done the research already, you should now be ready to tell your parents how you feel. Remember to stay calm and in control even if they are initially resistant. Instead, continue to maturely show them you're interested by looking into joining a church or school choir, singing whenever you have the opportunity, even casually, and occasionally trying to have more conversations with them about it. Some arguments could go like this:   "I don't think that's a good idea. You need to go to school." "I can still go to school. I would do all of my practice after school, and any performances would be on the weekends. If I got famous and I had to quit public school, I could get private teachers or do long distance learning through computers." "You won't enjoy it. It's a lot of work." "I know it's a lot of work. I did a lot of research on what Michael Jackson and Hillary Duff have been through for their singing careers. But, I really believe that I can do this, especially if you'll help keep me on track." "Wouldn't you rather just keep singing a hobby that you love?" "People say that you should love what you do. I think that if I had a job about something I was passionate about, it would never really feel like work." "We don't have that kind of money." "We could find ways to make money so I could get training and go to perform. We could do bake sales, and car washes, and I could take small singing jobs in town."  

face the reality.  research a child singer.  research music genres.  define for yourself what "successful" means.  understand why you need your family's support.  come up with a convincing argument.  have a discussion with your parents. 

 You need to be in a place that you will be undisturbed and quiet. It’s also a good idea to have a place where you consistently meditate so your body and mind get used to the place and position and you can more easily activate the third eye., Like the location, most practitioners of meditation benefit from meditating at the same time every day. Think about when you would be best suited to meditate, be relaxed, and free your mind. Don’t do it immediately before or after eating. Many people prefer to meditate in the morning, but any time of day that you choose can work if you keep at it consistently., By getting out some of the kinks in your body, you will be able to sit for longer and more comfortably as you meditate. Doing this every time before you meditate can also help you get into the mental framework you need for meditation. Try each of these for about 30 seconds each:Bending over and trying to touch your toes Stretching your arms above your head Laying on your back with your feet in the air – your legs at a ninety-degree angle with the rest of your body  , For most people, the ideal position would be to sit relaxed and cross legged. If this is uncomfortable or difficult, experiment with other positions that make it easier to focus on your breath and meditation. Work up to sitting cross-legged on the floor.   Keep your chest open and your back straight. Place your hands in your lap or on your knees -- whichever feels better. Keep your head upright and your eyes gently closed.  Allow your body to settle. Breathe in and out. Be mindful of your body and how it feels. If there are aches in your body, work on relaxing those before you begin.   Focus on each part of your body in turn as you sit and relax Begin to move your mind away from your worries and get ready to focus on the present moment Feel your body expand and contract with each breath  , Breathing is the key to all meditation. Be aware of how your breath goes in and out. Try to focus entirely on your breathing. Take a deep breath (inhale for the count of three, the out for the count of three), repeat with two other deep breaths, and then begin.  This is the point at which you will begin to start focusing on the third eye, the center of your forehead. Under your eyelids, move your eyes toward the third eye. Keep them focused there throughout the meditation. Begin counting backward from one hundred as you focus. If you aren’t able to get in touch with the third eye immediately, don’t worry. Meditation can take a while to get used to, and activating the third eye even longer., By the time you have reached the end of your counting backward from one hundred, you should be ready to access the third eye. When you focus well, then you sense everything is dark except at the third eye chakra. If your third eye is activated, your brain will be relaxed but functioning at a new level. Both sides of the brain will be working together and you will be aware of the energy around you.You will know you have accessed the third eye when your body feels a new level of energy both coursing through it and around it You can also tell if your third eye has been activated when you are able to focus strongly on one object or image and your mind is completely consumed by that object or image.  People have different reactions to the activation of the third eye. Some people experience the mind flashing different visual effects, like images of nature, waterfalls, people, trains, and other scenes that you might have seen. Some people describe it as being able to see your thoughts, almost as if they are scrolling by on a blackboard., It is common to have a headache during your first attempts to activate the third eye. Don’t worry -- as you continue to practice the headaches will go away. To train yourself to more fully appreciate the third eye, try focusing on one particular image. It could be a number, it could be an object -- just try to keep your mind centered on whatever image you have chosen., Move your eyes away from the third eye. Stay relaxed, but become more aware of your breath. Be mindful of the way that your breath goes in and out. Sometimes counting helps to put more focus on your breath as you are coming out of your meditation. Slowly open your eyes., It will become easier to activate the third eye as your meditation practice continues. Work on focusing on different images when you are meditating to help your concentration improve and keep the third eye activated.  Meditation on the third eye is a part of the larger practice of Hatha Yoga, which integrates both physical movements with meditation and energy work. The chakras, or energy centers of the body, are all linked -- the ajna chakra or third eye is the one that is highest on the body. To work on activating the others would require a practice using the body, not just meditation., Since the third eye is a chakra, you can work on making your body feel better and become more in touch with your inner, intuitive self. But this does not come immediately -- keep practicing your meditation and working on greater levels of focus within it. You might find yourself becoming more in touch with your body and the energy that flows within you and around you -- this is the point of meditation on the third eye.  

choose your location.  be intentional with the time you choose.  stretch before you begin.  position yourself.  relax.  breathe.  empty your mind.  access the third eye.  experience the third eye.  stay focused on the third eye for 10-15 minutes.  bring yourself slowly out of the meditation.  practice daily.  consider practicing hatha yoga.  harness the energy of your meditation. 

 Ice wine is manufactured across the globe, but Germany and Canada are known for producing the best ice wines. If you’re looking for a traditional ice wine, select a wine from one of these two countries.Canadian and German wines primarily use Riesling grapes in their ice wines.Canadian wines do not age well and are best consumed when they are younger. German wines should be allowed to age a little longer.; , The United States is not a major producer of ice wines, but it does have several very successful vineyards. If you’re buying ice wine from the US, look for wines manufactured in very cold regions, like Michigan or the Finger Lake region of New York.If you’re an ice wine super-fan or if you’re local to New York, visit the NY State Ice Wine Festival, which is held every February in Fairport, New York. Wineries across the region bring samples for vendors and new fans to sample and enjoy. There are also other festivals scattered across New York, as well as across the country. Try Googling Ice Wine festivals to find an option near you.  Australia is much warmer than other countries where ice wine is manufactured, and therefore, their methods are a bit more controversial. Australian ice wine is created using artificial freezing techniques, instead of natural freezing techniques.Tasters are unable to tell the difference between wines frozen artificially and wines frozen naturally, but if you're looking for a more traditional ice wine experience, avoid Australian ice wine.  

try canadian or german ice wine.  try an ice wine from the us.  try an australian ice wine. 

 Deciding to do a digital detox can be a big decision. You may worry about what you’ll miss by logging out. You might even wonder what you’ll do with your time. You can do a digital detox if you remind yourself of all the good reasons why you should take this time to log off and unplug.Make a list of three to five things you want to try to get done during your detox time. For instance, you might write that you want to work in your garden, organize your closets, or catch up with old friends. Remind yourself of the benefits of the detox. For example, tell yourself, “I’ll feel more relaxed, in tune with myself, and in tune with my family and friends.” Tell yourself that the detox will give you a break from some of the information-overload you may be feeling.; , Although you may want to start your digital detox right now, you should think about the timing of your detox first. Deciding to log off during a peak work time or around exam time during school may not be best decision. Choose a time when you have fewer responsibilities and when there will be less consequences for missing a message or two.Think about having your detox over a weekend, school break, or holiday. You are less likely to receive important messages during those times. Look at your calendar and pick a time when you don’t have any upcoming deadlines or important events. This way you won’t miss updates about them.  You may not realize all the ways in which you depend on your smartphone and other devices in your day-to-day life. For instance, if you use your phone as an alarm, do you have an alarm clock you can use while you detox? If you want to listen to music during the detox, do you have a radio? If you use your phone or computer for driving directions, do you have maps so you won't get lost? Before your detox, try to note all the different ways in which you rely on your devices and think of other ways to meet your needs.  You may also need to think about how you will do this if your family is not participating in the detox. What will you do if everyone is watching TV? Do you have a digital-free area where you can retreat to read or work on a craft project? How will you fill your time and avoid the temptation when other people are using their devices?  , In general a digital detox will last for about one to two days.This gives you time to connect with your friends and family and do some of the things you’ve been meaning to do. But, if you have a lot of obligations, this might be too long for you. Deciding how long to detox will help you plan for it and anticipate any issues that may come up during your detox time.   Consider your responsibilities and obligations. How long can you digitally detox without getting behind in your work? Think about people that depend on you. Ask yourself if there is anything you would need to do online for them during this time.  If you are including work or school in your digital detox, you may need to let others know what you are doing.This way they can let you know what’s going on and you won’t miss messages about major deadlines or other important information.   Do you have a landline so that someone can call and reach you in case of an emergency? You might also want to let family members know that it's okay to show up unannounced if there is an emergency. Ask someone to contact you with important messages if your digital detox is going to last more than 12 hours. For instance, say something like, “Could you call me on my landline if we have a schedule update at work?” If you primarily communicate with people via text, email, or messaging, you may want to let them know what’s going on.  Nothing can ruin a digital detox or any peaceful time like an electronic device that’s beeping, binging, and chirping every two minutes. Staying logged in will make it easy for you to quickly turn on your device, especially if you have widgets, and check your social networking updates. Logging out and turning off all notifications for social media can help you stick with your detox.   You don’t need to disable your account, but you can log out of the app on your device. You can log back in once your digital detox is over. Make sure you know your login information before you log out of the app. Turn off your alerts and notifications if you can’t or don’t want to log out of your apps.  When your device is right by your side you may be tempted to check it to make sure you aren’t missing anything. Keeping your phone, tablet, or laptop at a distance will make it easier for you to do a digital detox.Remember the adage “out of sight, out of mind.” Put your device in a closet, drawer, or somewhere out of sight. If you need to, ask a family member or close friend to keep your device for you during your digital detox.  One great way to make the most of your digital detox is to spend some of your time doing something to help someone else. It doesn’t have to be a big thing like repainting their house, but you can take an hour or two to do something that benefits someone else.   Volunteer for a cause or organization that you support or attend a charitable event in your neighborhood. Offer to go grocery shopping for your dad, walk your neighbor’s dog, or help your friend wash her car.  During a digital detox is a great time to practice relaxation techniques and calming strategies.When your detox is over, these strategies will help you release stress and tension when you begin to feel digital overload or stress in general.   Try spending just five to 10 minutes meditating. Get comfortable and try to focus on your breathing. If you find your thoughts drifting, gently bring them back to your breathing. Practice deep breathing techniques. Slowly inhale into your belly, hold it, and then slowly exhale. Repeat these steps for a few breaths.  One of the challenges of doing a digital detox is boredom. You may be so used to being online that you don’t know what to do with your time. You can use your time during your digital detox to try a new activity or learn a new skill.Read a book or article about a topic that interests you. You can even go to the library to look at a hard copy instead of a digital one. Take a class or lesson to learn a new skill or talent. For instance, take a gymnastics class or sign up for foreign language lessons.  It can be easy to let social networking and messaging take the place of face-to-face or even phone interaction. You can make the most of your digital detox by spending at least some of your time with your family and friends.You can use this time to catch up, talk, or just hang out.   Give them your undivided attention when you’re together. You don’t have your electronic device distracting you, so look them in the eyes and show them you’re listening. Invite them somewhere or accept their invitations to go out. Catch a movie, grab some coffee, or play some basketball.  Ease yourself back into the digital world. This way you won’t become overwhelmed by the information and entertainment. It will also give you the opportunity to think about which social networks, apps, and games and actually want and need to use.Start by logging back into your primary email account. Prioritize your messages and respond to those you need to. Delete any messages that aren’t important and take a few minutes to unsubscribe to any newsletters or updates you don’t really need.  After your detox, try setting limits for your digital time. This way you can avoid getting caught up in the never-ending cycle of emails, alerts, updates, and posts.Try checking and responding to emails only in the morning (between the hours of 9 and 10am, for instance) and at the end of the day (from 4:30 to 5pm). Turn your notifications off on social media apps and sites. This way you won’t be tempted to check every time your electronic device beeps. Limit the time you spend on social networking sites. For example, you might set a limit of 15 minutes for being on Twitter or Snapchat.  You will get the most benefit out of your digital detox if you make it something that you do more than once.You don’t have to do a full detox for a day or more, though. Doing a mini detox, even for just an hour or two, might help you briefly recharge and relax.   Consider the hour before bed as a non-digital time. Put your electronic devices on vibrate and turn any non-essential alerts off. Have a regular weekend detox for a few hours. For example, you might want to spend every Sunday morning free of your electronics.  

motivate yourself.  choose when to detox.  think through the logistics.  decide how long to detox.  give advance notice.  log out of social networks.  put your electronic devices out of reach.  help someone.  meditate and relax.  learn something new.  socialize with loved ones.  log in one app at a time.  limit yourself.  do a mini detox.

 This expression actually means "to like" but it's the most commonly used form of expressing love. If you add "dai" to the beginning ("daisukidesu") it means "I really like you."  , This is best used to convey true and committed feelings of love. Nothing about this expression speaks to friendship. Do not use it unless your feelings are strong.  This means "you are precious" and may be a preferred way to express your feelings if you're not quite ready for a committed relationship.  This can be translated "Don't you know how much I love you?" Uttering this expression is a way to offer an explanation--"nan" is used when giving or asking for explanations.  Those who perhaps are a bit too practical to believe in love at first sight, might talk about "koi no yokan," which refers to the feeling upon meeting someone that love is in the cards, in time.  

suki desu 好きです.  kimi wa ai shiteru a  iしてるの君.  taisetu 大切.  suki nan da 好きなんだ.  koi no yokan. 

 Alternatively, cut down a wool blanket to a smaller size; this is a useful repurposing for blankets that are nearing the end of their days. It must be one hundred percent wool, as this won't catch fire easily.   Spray the wool blanket with water, so it is a little bit misty. Pop it in the microwave or dryer for a little bit to heat it up. Wrap it around your neck or anywhere that is sore.  

use a woolen baby's blanket. 

 Before you begin swinging your toddler, make sure the area is clear of other children. Additionally, make sure older children know not to start swinging until the front and back area of the swing set is clear of children.While your toddler is young, help them become aware of moving swings and the dangers of standing too close. Let them know that if they stand too close to a moving swing they may get hurt.  When you place your child in the swing, also place their hands around the swing's straps. Tell them to hold onto the straps tightly at all times.If you see your toddler let go of the straps while you are swinging them, then stop the swing immediately and place their hands around the straps again. Let them know that you cannot resume swinging until they are holding onto the straps.  While your child is a toddler, you should always be nearby when they are swinging or playing on the swing set. This way you can prevent accidents from happening, as well as socialize them on the appropriate swing set behavior.  Try to place the swing set in an area that it is visible from your living room or kitchen window. This way, you can supervise your children from afar once they are old enough to play on the swing set by themselves.  

make sure the area is clear.  teach your toddler to hold onto the swing's straps at all times.  supervise your toddler at all times. 

 With the exception a a few professional inline leagues, most inline hockey players do not wear shoulder pads because direct checking is not allowed, although, rubbing players into the boards is OK. There are players however, that feel more comfortable and protected wearing shoulder pads anyway. Another alternative to shoulder pads that many high level players wear, is a padded shirt. These are breathable stretch shirts with pieces of foam and hard plastic shells inserted. They offer good protection without having bulk of shoulder pads.(They are also socially accepted so you won't get chirped at. XD); , One piece of equipment a lot of inline players do not wear but should is a girdle or "hockey pants." Inline girdles are more lightweight and cooler than ice girdles. There might not be legal checking, but this is still a contact sport and collisions are frequent. Most inline girdles have a jock built in and some even come with a cup. , Shin guards are both recommended and required equipment. Ice hockey shin guards are more often than not exactly the same as inline, as in, shin guards are shin guards as long as they are designed for hockey. Hockey shin guards also provide knee protection unlike soccer shin guards for example, and are designed to take the impact of a puck as well as a stick.  Many players over the age of 18 prefer no extra face protection or wear a half shield. A full face cage or shield is highly recommended. , Often times sticks from opposing players will get up on the hands, many times unintentionally. Gloves are the same as shin guards in the sense there is no difference between ice hockey and inline gloves. , Inline Hockey skates for the most part, are ice hockey skates with wheels. If you are looking for skates, try them on first and see what feels comfortable to you. If you have the option, bake new skates. Baking skates helps them conform to the shape of your foot and much faster. This makes the breaking in process shorter and less painful. One mistake a lot of new or inexperienced skaters make is not tying their skates tight enough. Once you have the skates good a tight, pull them tighter. The tighter the skate the healthier for your ankles and knees but also, the better and faster you will be able to skate. Loose skates will be harder to stand on and when you take a stride will absorb the energy of your push whereas a tight skate will transfer that energy through the skate to the floor.  This is a matter a preference. Some people like to wear their shins over the tongue of their skates. Other players prefer to wear their shins under the tongue, or inside their skates.  Ice on the other hand calls for a bigger girdle so nothing is worn over it, instead hockey socks are worn to cover the shin guards. Some inline players also play ice and wear an ice girdle and hockey socks when playing inline. Other inline players wear shorts over their girdle and wear ice hockey socks. Wearing pants or socks is not important however, most leagues require you to cover all your pads.  The type of jersey you wear does not matter however, inline jerseys are much cooler than ice jerseys.  

decide whether to wear shoulder pads.  get a girdle.  an athletic cup is very important for both male and female players and is required of players under the age of 18.  ,  get shin guards.  helmets are also a required piece of equipment for all ages and for players under the age of 18 it also required they wear a full face cage or shield.  mouth pieces are only required of players under the age of 18 however, but are recommended.  ,  hockey gloves are important if you like having the use of your fingers.  hockey elbow pads are another piece of equipment that is not worn by many players and most definitely should be worn every time you are on the floor.  ,  choose your skates carefully.  put your shin guards wherever they feel comfortable.  typically, inline hockey uniforms call for inline hockey pants which you wear over your girdle and shin guards.  inline jerseys are also much lighter than ice jerseys. 

 In the bowl of your stand mixer, combine 1 1/3 cups warm water, 4 tablespoons softened butter, ½ cup honey, 2 ¾ cups bread flour, 1 ¾ cups whole wheat flour, 2 teaspoons salt, 1 tablespoon powdered caramel color, and 2 ½ teaspoons instant yeast.You can use an electric hand mixer if you do not own a stand mixer.  Place the paddle attachment on your stand mixer. Mix the dough on low until combined. This should take about 1-2 minutes. Scrape the dough from the sides of the mixer bowl, and replace the paddle attachment with the dough hook attachment. Continue mixing until you have formed dough that is smooth, yet slightly sticky., Remove the bowl of dough from your stand mixer and cover the bowl. Place the bowl of dough in a warm, but not hot, place. Allow the dough to rise for 1 hour. The dough will not double in size. It should, however, be slightly puffy after 1 hour.  After allowing the dough to rise for an hour, divide it into rolls. You should separate the dough into 10 separate rolls. Then shape each individual roll into an oval that is 6 inches by 2 inches, or 15 ¼ centimeters by 5 centimeters.  Take 1 cup of cornmeal and place it in a medium sized bowl. Then take each individual roll and place it in the bowl of cornmeal. Use your hands to lightly coat each roll. Place each coated roll on a lightly greased baking sheet.  Cover the rolls with plastic wrap. Move the baking sheet of rolls to a warm place. Allow the rolls to rise for 90-120 minutes. The rolls will become puffy. You will know they are ready to bake when you gently press your finger into a roll and the indentation rebounds very slowly., Near the end of the rolls’ rising time, you will preheat your oven. Turn your oven on to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, or 176 degrees Celsius. This is the temperature at which you will bake your rolls.  Remove the plastic wrap from the baking sheet of rolls. Place the baking sheet in your preheated oven. Bake the rolls for 24 minutes. The bottoms of the rolls will be slightly browned when they are done. Remove the rolls, cool the rolls on a cooling rack, and enjoy! 

combine all ingredients except the cornmeal.  mix the ingredients.  let the dough rise.  shape the rolls.  coat the rolls.  allow the rolls to rise.  preheat the oven.  bake the rolls. 

 Brush your teeth twice a day, and (if you can be bothered) use mouthwash afterwards. Shower after school or dinner or whenever you want to. Wash your hair whenever you feel it needs a wash. If you can't tell, ask your mother to let you know, and if you can't do that for whatever reason, wash it every three days. Before you get dressed, put on deodorant.   Use pimple cream if needed. The best time for this is usually right after you have a shower or brush your teeth––put the gear on the bench next to the faucet in the bathroom.; , Some girly-girls will get up crazy early to style their hair, but let's be real. The more time spent in bed the better, right? So apart from washing your hair every three days, what else do you have to do? Pick a signature style. Two easy favorites are messy plaits/braids or a high ponytail. These are really simple and take about five minutes to do.  Again, who has time for this? If you want to wear it, you could wear foundation, lip gloss and mascara. For school, maybe a little mascara but definitely don't wear anything else. If you're a true tomboy, you won't really feel the need for eyeliner and blush and eyeshadow, because it really takes away from the casual look.   You don't want to wear anything skin tight or hard to move around in. Comfort always comes first but be sure to look cute. Jeans, oversized sweaters and tees, Uggs, Converse, flowing shorts, form-fitting blouses, and crop tops are nice.   Do not go out and buy all the latest trends, or read *shudders* fashion magazines. Try tracksuit pants, ripped jeans, leggings and shorts for pants, and t-shirts, tank tops or crop-tops for shirts. For shoes, three pairs is enough––Ugg boots, high tops and Converses. Literally wear whatever is comfortable. Don't wear shorts in the middle of winter!  , Maybe wear one bracelet with your thing on it, such as a yin and yang symbol on it. You may wish to wear something on your head, whether it be a cap, a bow or a headband. Accessorizing is something to have fun with. Don't fuss though, there is no need to be into jewellery at all.   Yes, it is okay to wear beanies throughout the entire year.  A few starter pack traits for popular tomboy are to be: Funny, sporty and friendly. Have a smile pretty much glued to your face. When people are around you, say hi, and think of something to do instead of just standing there. You could even start dancing the YMCA dance completely randomly. We dare you!  , As an ice cube. It's really important to keep your cool, and above all, never see yourself as popular. If people know you know you're popular and can see a lack of humility, they won't want you to be popular anymore. Don't take advantage of it!   If insulted, walk away or make a witty comeback. Yes, 'witty'. Deal with it. Don't stand there and take it, just shrug and walk away, or tell them to 'chill'.   A big part in being a tomboy and popular is maintaining somewhat boyish hobbies. Sports are a big deal.  Play as many as you can, and don't be afraid to get down and dirty while playing them.  Run around, laugh, don't be afraid of getting hurt, and just have fun while playing! Track, soccer, swimming, basketball, and dodgeball are great.   If you want to be popular you have to open yourself up to new people.  Talk to everyone, and get to know everyone.  It doesn't matter who they are, it doesn't matter what their personality is, as long as their a worthy friend, then make friends with them!  Just say hi.  Also be sure to talk to a lot of boys and hang with them too.   Boys are known to be more daring and strong than girls, so don't be afraid to take risks!  Your favourite quote should be YOLO (you only live once).  It's true, and it never hurts to try, and you might fail or get hurt, but it's worth it! Enjoy your time here.   Okay, school is very important, as it can affect your future a lot. Always do your homework before having fun, pay attention in class, take notes, ask the teacher about things you don't understand, and participate. Just put the studies first and then do whatever you want after. Tomboys don't fail school, they enjoy it especially when it comes to sporty things.  Let all your emotions out, and don't be afraid to get rough!  Life is too short to live with worries, so smile everyday!  You will fail multiple times, but keep on pushing through! You may not be awesome today, but you can be awesome tomorrow so don't let it ruin your day. Keep that mindset forever.  Just be yourself, confident, and rule!  , It can be helpful to carry with you a small black backpack. In it, carry:   Mints and gum Chips Deodorant (and sometimes perfume) A book Your laptop (and chargers). Phone, wallet, keys. Simple, but effective. Make sure to have on hand your wallet, phone and earphones, and keys to your house. This is pretty much the essentials.  If you're cheap, don't have time to stop at Starbucks, or live in a place where there is no Starbucks, buy coffee cups from the supermarket and make yourself a hot chocolate. Then rock up to drama in the morning with your messy hair (on point obviously), tracksuit pants and Ugg boots and an absolutely chill coffee cup. This works almost every time.  Everybody is friends with 'the kid with food'. Even if you don't want to share your food, know that the easiest way to become popular is to bring a bag of chips, or a pack of gum and be like, "Hey want some?" Come on guys, who says no to free gum?  

have good hygiene.  fix your hair.  consider the need for makeup.  dress comfortable yet cute.  choose minimal accessories.  be the kind of person you want to be.  be chill.  play sports.  make friends.  take risks.  put the studies first.  relax and smile.  pack the things that help may your day an easier one.  if you are going to a place really early in the morning and you don't have time to eat breakfast, go to starbucks and show up at this place with starbucks.  share that food around. 

 Many dog trainers believe that excessively anxious, excitable, or frightened dogs are the direct result of insufficient training. You must reinforce positive behavior when training your dog. Teach it to not get anxious at the vet, excitable at the dog park, or frightened by thunderstorms. Do this by offering an alternative task to focus on and then rewarding it when it completes the task successfully.For example, during a trip to the veterinarian’s office, if you dog gets overly anxious in the waiting room, tell it to “sit” or “lay down”. Really any basic command will do. Then reward your dog after they’ve successfully followed your command. This will reinforce the training and take your dog’s mind off of the stressful situation. In the future, your dog may even associate the waiting room of the vet with sitting and receiving a treat, not with being probed by a stranger., Your dog thinks of you as a member of its pack. If he sees you anxious or fearful, he will adopt a similar emotional state. If you find yourself in an unsettling situation, don’t let it show. Take deep breaths and count them, exhaling slowly and deliberately.   For example, if you take your pet to the vet for an operation and you’re stressed about it, don’t let your dog see it. You want to always create a positive experience for your dog in these situations. Alternatively, if you shriek every time you hear a thunder clap, your dog will think there is something to fear. This will cause anxiety too., Pheromones are chemical messengers given off by a dog’s mother during nursing to reassure her pups that they are safe and secure. Synthetic versions of this chemical, known as Dog Appeasing Pheromones (DAPs) are available for purchase as many pet superstores. Simply plug them into the wall or attach them to your dog’s collar and watch them calm your canine companion., Zylkene contains a protein extracted from milk that acts as a calming agent — like diazepam. This capsule is given twice daily and has been shown to calm dogs during thunderstorms, trips to the vet, or stays at the kennel., They will be able to advise you on what measures will work best - either behavioral or medical. If necessary, you can get a prescription for stronger medications. Only give these to your dogs if your vet prescribes them and do so according to the vet's instructions. Five types of medicines are usually used to treat behavior problems in dogs. These are benzodiazepines (BZs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). 

train your dog.  mask your own reaction.  use pheromone diffusers.  give your dog a zylkene supplement.  talk to your veterinarian. 

 This grip should be close to identical to a wrist shot. You may want to slightly raise your dominant hand's position on the stick in order to get more power.  You will need to hit the ice slightly before the shot so the puck needs to be further up in your stance.   The stance for the slap shot should be identical to any other shot. You should still assume an athletic stance and be angled about 45 degrees to the intended target of your shot.  Do this by raising your dominant hand backwards and raising the stick off the ice.   To a certain extent, the higher you raise the stick, the more power you will get from the shot. If you want less power, raise the stick only to your hip. You should also transfer your weight to your back foot at this step. Just like in the wrist shot, this will help you gain more control and accuracy.  You should try to hit the ice slightly before the puck for the slap shot. Think of it as if you are shooting the puck down into the ice. This will help the puck rise off the ice.   Flick your dominant hand's wrist slightly one you make contact with the puck. This will help with the power and rise of the puck.  Angle your hips and shoulders where you want the puck to go and point the blade in the direction of the target.   The follow-through may not seem as important but it is essential in aiming. Thinking of the follow through while shooting will help focus your aim toward the target.  

grip the shaft of the stick correctly.  position the puck about halfway between your two feet for the slap shot.  raise the stick so that it is about parallel to your shoulders.  quickly bring the stick down toward the puck and shift your weight forward.  follow through correctly. 

 Sticking a knife with no rotation is made possible by modifying the standard throwing grip. Wrap your hand loosely around the handle of the knife. Pinch the handle between your thumb and the length of your middle finger. Place your index finger flat against the spine of the blade at the knife’s center of balance. This is known as the “thumb grip,” or sometimes the “drive-finger grip,” as you’ll be using your thumb to guide the movement of the knife and your index finger to drive it forward as you release.The thumb grip is used to neutralize the rotation of the blade after it leaves the hand. Every knife will have a slightly different center of balance. Locate the knife’s center of balance by laying it across one outstretched finger and adjusting it until it balances on its own. This is the section of the knife on which you should place the point of your finger.; , Hold your arm straight out in front of you with the tip of the blade trained on your target. Eyeball the exact spot you’re aiming for. Pay close attention to the angle and position of your arm. This is where your arm will need to be at the moment you release the knife.Pointing the knife in the direction of the target before you throw can help muscle memory take over, giving you a sense of exactly where your arm should be when you release. For better accuracy, make a quick initial lineup part of your throwing ritual.  Keeping your shoulder fixed and your upper arm parallel with the ground, draw the knife back until it’s level with your head. Your elbow should be bent about 90 degrees, with the blade of the knife pointing straight up. Square your stance and take a small step forward with your opposite foot.To get an idea of what position your shoulder and forearm need to be in, hold up your throwing arm as though you were making the “goal” gesture used by fans of American football. The Mumyou-Ryu technique was derived from a technique used by ancient Japanese warriors to throw circular projectiles (shuriken, or “throwing stars”) without rotation. It was adapted for use with straight, modern knives and spikes., Lean over your front foot as you prepare to throw. Let go of the knife while your throwing arm is at roughly a 45 degree angle—this will help compensate for gravity and create the relaxed arc that the knife will trace in the air. At the moment of release, lightly “brush” the length of the spine with your pointer finger. Straighten your arm so that you complete the throw pointing at your target.

 An online search including “district attorney” and the county or city name will almost always turn up an email and physical address. Alternately, you can call or visit the country or city court to request this information.   If you are looking for the specific attorney handling your case, it is best to email or call the county or city court clerk to find this information.; , For best results, you will want to write a formal letter and address the district attorney appropriately.The envelope: The Honorable (Full name), District Attorney of (city or county) Letter salutation: Dear Mr. / Madame District Attorney:  , Make your letter as brief as possible while still including all the required information. Even if you are upset – e.g. you are a victim writing because our case is not being prosecuted – try to keep you letter formal and respectful. This is the best way to ensure a positive response., If you are a defendant – in traffic court, for instance – and wish for more time to prepare your defense, you can sometimes write the district attorney for a continuance, though in some jurisdictions, you will need to appear in person to do so.State the reason you need a continuance – i.e. to prepare your defense – in your letter.  All 50 states allow victim impact statements, which allow victims to indicate the toll the crime has take on them, and which may impact the judge’s sentence. These statements may include descriptions of:Injury caused by the crime Emotional damage caused by the crime Financial cost of the crime Medical or psychological treatments required by the victim The victim’s views on the crime and the appropriate punishment  , During the course of a trial, you may need to send written statements or other information to the district attorney, or ask questions.  Anything you write to the district attorney may be admissible as evidence in your case. Accordingly, your lawyer should handle all communication with the prosecution.  In some states, you will need to write to a special agency to obtain these records, but in most states, you can write to your local district attorney. You can find a form information request letter for each state here. You will typically have to pay a per-page fee for any document produced. Be sure to include as much information as possible, including:Name of defendant(s) Indictment or docket number Approximate date of the trial  , If a crime is happening at that moment, call 911. Otherwise, write or call your local police department to report most crimes, including theft, vandalism, assault, or nuisance complaints.  Cases of public corruption should be brought directly to the attention of the district attorney. Give as much information as you can on the crime. The cases DAs will investigate vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but often include:Public corruption Criminal acts by members of the judiciary Election violations Fraud involving large amounts (typically over $300,000) Environmental crimes  , DAs typically have 1 to 2 years to bring charges, and a trial may be delayed by workload or the need to gather evidence.That said, if you are a victim and feel that the DA is failing to pursue your case, you can write a letter encouraging him or her to do so. For best results, be sure to add a cc list, letting the DA know that you have also sent the letter to other important people, including his or her boss. People to consider putting in your cc: include:Local officials – the mayor, city council members, judges, etc. Local leaders- A prominent clergy person, business leaders, etc. Appropriate organizations and issue Groups – NAACP, National Organization for Victim Assistance, American Civil Liberties Union, National Organization for Women, etc. State and national officials – attorney general, state and national congress people, governor Local newspapers and journalists  , All states have laws that require the government to give citizens access to public records. If the government fails to turn over records, the next step is usually to contact the local district attorney to lodge a criminal complaint.Be sure to specify as precisely as possible the documents you requested and to include a copy of any rejection notice sent to you.  Even if you were at fault, DAs will often reduce the level of the fine or change the nature of the charge so no points accrue to your license if you have a previously clean driving record. There is no guarantee your letter will succeed, but as it only costs you a few minutes and a stamp, it’s worth a try.  The DA will likely contact the officer who pulled you over to ask about the incident. Officers take notes on each stop, and if you were rude, he will let the DA know. That will likely mean the failure of your request, since the success of your letter depends on the DA’s good will., You can call or email the clerk of the court for the county or city where you received your ticket to discover the District Attorney for your case.  A clean driving record can help convince the DA to reduce the penalty against you. The state department that issues drivers licenses will also be able to provide you with your driving record. See here for information on how to obtain your record in your state.  Keep your letter short and to the point. There are several things you will want to include:Mention that you are not contesting your speed or the speed zone in the area. Explain why you were speeding – i.e. you did not realize the new speed limit after transitioning from a faster speed zone. Apologize and indicate that you will watch your speed more closely in the future. Mention your clean driving record and attach it. Ask for a reduced fine and/or a reduction in charges to a non-point violation.  

look up the correct address online or call the county court.  use the correct form of address.  keep your letter short and formal.  ask for a continuance, or extension of your trial date.  send a written victim impact statement during the sentencing phase of a trial.  communicate regarding the trial if you are a victim or witness.  do not write the district attorney if you are the defendant in a criminal case.  know that all states have freedom of information laws that allow you to request public records, including trial records held by district attorneys.  contact the local police to report most crimes.  write the district attorney regarding fraud and public corruption.  contact the district attorney if a crime against you is not being prosecuted.  report violations of freedom of information laws.  know that you can write a letter to the district attorney to reduce the cost of or even dismiss a traffic ticket.  be courteous when pulled over.  find the name and address of the district attorney handling your case.  obtain your driving record abstract or motor vehicle report.  write the district attorney. 

 The Mayan civilisation is far older than the Aztecs, although the Aztecs absorbed many of the customs and cultures of their hosts who were influenced by the Maya, and whom they later came to dominate. However it is not entirely clear when Mayan civilisation truly began. The Mayan long count calendar suggests 3114BC, however it is not clear whether this is a historical date inherited from the Olmecs or a legendary creation date.  The Pre-Classical Period started around 1800 to 2000BC (although it is suggested to have started even earlier around 2600BC in Belize) and extended through to around 250AD, from there it became known as the Classical period which extended to 900AD. After this is typically called the Post Classic period, which extended up to the arrival of the Spaniards & Conquistadors, although the Mayan civilisation still exists today in a syncretized form. The Pre-Classical Period peoples grew rich by extracting jade, obsidian and seashells. These semi precious stones were used in jewellery, ritual offerings, and expensive crafted wares and for utilitarian use with the obsidian producing reliably sharp edges. They also came rich through the cultivation of cacao (from which Chocolate is produced), the pods and nibs of which traditionally was traded as currency as well as other forms of trade. This culture may have had influence and interactions with the even older Olmec civilisation with whom they traded, but the roots of the Mayan civilisation are still yet to be understood. Around 100AD, the first of two major social collapses started, the cause is still open to debate. In 250AD, things started to improve for the Mayans and they started to build their mega cities and temple complexes. During the classical period, the Mayan population was in the millions, so for the time was a very large civilisation. Trade, political and social contacts were broad and were quite ingrained to the culture, becoming an important networking system, including trade much further north and in the Caribbean. During this period has several centuries of abundant rainfall, which helped agriculture and the civilisation to flourish, but whenever the climate changed, it led to problems with the harvest, food supplies and consequent warfare, which was both political and for religious purposes. By 900AD, the civilisation began its second great collapse, with cities once again being abandoned. The sequence of events is still unknown, however scholars and archaeology suggest it was largely the effect of drought and reduction of rainfall, partly contributed by clearing large areas of forest for agriculture. Dependent on access to clean water supplies and rain for the crops that became increasingly scarce, by 1100AD, the peak of the Mayan civilisation was over. After this period is typically called the Post-Classic and Colonial Periods. Several larger cities managed to survive, perhaps as a result of careful management or that the droughts had not affected them so severely, but also came under increasing external cultural influences. This culture persisted for another few hundred years until they had become reduced to rival city states, which were far more susceptible to the conquering Spaniards. However, it made things more difficult for the conquistadors; unlike the Aztecs and Inca societies, which were run from a central government, the Mayans had no overreaching central structure and so fought independently, often fiercely until one by one they were conquered. Often the conquered communities rebelled which slowed their progress. The conquistadors also had bigger fish to fry as the Mayan territory were not as rich in precious metals as the Aztec and Peruvian nations as the Spanish had hoped, so it took as long as 170 years to completely conquer the Mayan civilisation.; , Central to many of the Mayan communities was the local ruler and his family, who ran a hereditary throne as well as possibly had near absolute power with the associated belief in divine rule (ie, the King was chosen to rule by the Gods). These rulers would often lead the community in social, political and religious roles.   The visiting Spaniards (after the larger collapse of the Maya) often observed the later cities as little more than a neighbourhood surrounding a temple and palace complex. For this non-centralist politic of the Mayans meant few if any were large cities made the size of the far larger Aztec cities such as Tenochtitlan. Scribes were a highly respected social class within the Mayan communities, often being priests or of the nobility themselves. The higher caste of priest was more involved in teaching the mathematics and sciences, writing books, appointing new priests acted as advisors and being involved in the higher level rituals. The priests in charge of the sacrifices tended to have a lower status, where the higher status was reserved for the oracle priests and high priests. Most people (who didn't specialise as warriors) were involved in a service or manufacturing trade, as the civilisation depended on trade to be able to sustain its larger communities and cities. Most produced things such as jewellery, textiles, fine ceramics, paper and book making, and other wares that were often very labour intensive, as the absence of hard metals and many hard stones limited the development of tools and mass production. There was long distance as well as regional trade so travel between cities was a common occupation for some people. Salt often was dehydrated along the coastlines and traded along with fish and shells to the interior. Lower lands tended to grow Chocolate (Theobroma Cacao) which was traded up to higher mountain areas and other long distance traded goods included honey, precious and hard stones as well as precious metals, decorative feathers and decorative wares, books, ceramics and textiles. Building the monuments and cities, as well as agriculture would have played an important role. Unfortunately, warfare was also a common threat, if not part of the social structure so local dynasties would often be at threat. The Mayan civilisation was far from a utopia in this regard. An important social group were those who specialised in herbal medicines, the Mayan climate and landscape being ideal for the growth of pathogens as well as injuries and industrial accidents. The royalty, referred to as the k'uhul ajaw or holy lords were often viewed almost as demigods, being related to the Gods themselves. This helped them to cement their hereditary dynasties, but also placed them at the forefront of a very religious society, acting as an intermediary to the Gods. Bloodletting as a ritualized method was common amongst the nobility. It was a fairly popular practice to deform the shape of the head from a very young age. Desirable traits were a flat forehead, often created by tying a wooden board to the infants head to give the backward sloping effect. Also desirable was developing a cross-eyed feature, by dangling a small object in front of them until their eyes developed. Some communities preferred shaping their noses, which were sometimes broken to achieve.  Like the Aztecs, many of the ancient works were destroyed, so fragments and secreted volumes are all that are left for scholars.  The Popol Vuh, a later work written in colonial times suggests in the Mayan creation myth that the world started as nothing but the sea and the sky (presumably locked in an eternal night), devoid of life. The gods gave light, created the lands and then life. Animals were created first and humans much later although the primary animals created were later turned into stones. The creation of man seemed to have been a trial and error exercise of the Gods, who created man first out of mud and wood, yet finding them mind-less, destroyed them and created man as humans, after a short while, the Gods created the feminine gender. Like other Meso-American cultures, the Mayans believed in the world composed of three realms, the world, the underworld and the Heavens with gods ruling each of these. The Mayans often performed ritual offerings, as well as sacrifices in scale from symbolic to human sacrifices for a range of reasons such as to appeal to the Gods; to send the victim to Xibalba (the spirit world) with a message or request; to make the sun rise and the growing seasons to come; as a blood debt or acknowledgment to the creators; or to create relations with a particular deity. Unique among many cultures around the world in its time, the Mayan had a complex number system which included a zero, which allowed them to compute larger mathematical systems. The Mayans were also adept in astronomy in relation to time and the seasons. It is possible that the Mayan were one of the earliest cultures with both a developed writing system and mathematics in Meso America. While there are older cultures that also had this system in a basic form, it seems they flourished and developed under the Maya. Like many other Meso American cultures, the Mayan had a developed and complex calendar system. The Calendar did have a 365 day and 52 subsection denominations, but the calendar operated more distinct from the solar system, often focusing on lunar movements and the movement of Venus, which was often associated with war.  The Mayans were specialised in surviving in the rainforest climate, as while it was drier further north and south, civilizations sprouted around lakes and river systems which were ideal for agriculture as well as shipping their wares for trade, but also needed a centralized system to manage the resource. However in the lowlands where the Maya lived, there were few river systems, so the Maya depended on rainfall for their agriculture.   One of the common pastimes was the ballgame which was often played in large, grand courts. While the rules and even the purpose of the game is not fully known, its reckoned that the game was played as a hobby, as well as professionally played in the grand ball courts in the cities. The Meso-American ballgame is possibly the first sport to use a rubber ball and a similar ballgame known as Ulama is still played in central America. The cities generally held the most people, with population ranging from 5000 up to 50,000 people. It was likely to have been a busy place, with the large plazas thronging with traders and civilians. Apart from grand palace and temple complexes, the cities also held schools, libraries and hospitals. But by the time to Spanish arrived, most of these cities were abandoned and lost to the jungle with the remaining people living in small villages. The cities were often the sites of visits by religious pilgrims, as well as entertainments such as festivals and ball games. Outside of the cities were often many smallholder farms to grow food for the inhabitants. Those that weren't involved in trade or a skilled labour were typically involved in agriculture. The young children in Maya communities were trained for a very early age to have a strong work ethic and to support their elders and community. Children started their training as young as 5, typically by their mothers but after this age, boys were raised more by their fathers in a trade or agriculture. By 15, or when they reached puberty they typically had reached a key stage in life and a ritualised celebration was held for them. After this they were expected to be independent as adults, marriage was possible at this age. The cities primarily were built to make a grand statement of open space with the plazas and causeways being impressively defined with large buildings and pyramids. Later in the history, the cities became more security conscious and open space became a lesser priority as much as fortifications.  Mayan cuisine was quite varied, although still similar to many of the other local cultures and civilisations in Meso America.  Typical foods were beans, maize varieties, squash and cucurbits, and chilli peppers. Other valued crops were avocados, tomatoes, papaya, pineapple, edible flowers, agave, sweet potatoes and herbs or spices such as vanilla, allspice, native oregano and native aniseed. The Mayans grew large scale as well as small scale agriculture in forest gardens known as pet kot, which were typically a small garden within a loose stone wall enclosure. The Maya civilisation was possibly the first to create and value chocolate, creating a drink known as cacahuatl, which influenced the Aztecs from whom we get the word Xocolatl - the base word for chocolate. Maize was a central staple, being ground into a paste or meal, which would then be made into tortilla or tamales, cooked into beverages such as atole and gruel and cooked in many other ways. It was often processed, being mixed with an alkali such as lye and this process would make many of its nutrients more accessible. Protein was more common to the Mayan and included turkey, dog meat, deer, monkey, wildfowl, iguana as well as seafood such as fish, shellfish, and turtle.  Mayan textiles were a highly artistic occupation and the textiles created were often used as gifts and tributes to both the royalty and the Gods.  Clothing was a very labour intensive job, mostly performed by the women. The fibres needed to be gathered and processed from scratch to make the thread and yarn, which could then be weaved or made into a brocade and tapestry. Cotton was the common fabric of choice, but it needed to be washed and picked free of seeds (which was very labour intensive). Other fibres tended to come from native species such as maguey which gave a robust fibre for ropes, hammocks and other tough fabrics. The method used almost always was with a backstrap, which meant one end of the woven fabric was attached to a wall or a fixture and the other end was attached to a strap to which wrapped around the seated weaver, which would hold it straight and taut. Fabrics were often coloured vibrantly with dye, as well as tie dyed methods for impact to create a valued gift. Men typically wore a breechcloth (a style of loincloth) as well as a sleeveless shirt, which was white or coloured. Men of higher ranks would often wear jewellery and ceremonial headwear and neckwear, often made of jade or precious textiles. Women wore a dress known as a huitl, which was often white and decorated simply, or coloured and highly decorated for special occasions. The huitl is similar to a large loose tunic, which was made to make a dress that went from the shoulders to varying lengths according to local custom, sometimes to the ankles. Both men and women typically wore sandals, although deer hide moccasins were known. As the weather was tropical for much of the year, in the cooler dry period, both sexes wore a large rectangular piece of cloth that served as a wrap, a blanket at night as well as re-used as a curtain or tapestry depending on how well decorated they were and how wealthy the household was.

 If you are only mildly potassium deficient, eating potassium-rich foods should balance out your potassium levels. Once you have purchased potassium supplements, only take the prescribed amount--over compensating and taking more than the prescribed amount could lead to diarrhea, stomach irritation, and nausea and may cause muscle weakness, slowed heart rate, and abnormal heart rhythm.  Extended-release form tablets are designed so that it will not dissolve in the stomach, but in the intestines. This extended release will help prevent the irritation of gastric lining. Potassium tablets should be taken with one full glass of water.Do not crush or chew potassium tablet as this will affect their extended-release feature.  You can purchase potassium powder or liquid that can be mixed with water and then drunk. For the correct dosage, you should follow the instructions provided by your doctor. Generally, powdered and liquid potassium must be completely dissolved in a ½ glass of water. If too much of this powder or liquid is consumed, it could cause gastric irritation., Taking potassium intravenously is strictly intended for extreme cases of potassium depletion and used under strict physician supervision. If you think your potassium levels are dangerously low, talk to your doctor about intravenous potassium. Do not try this on your own. Fast infusion may lead to cardiac irritation causing life threatening irregular cardiac rhythms. 

consult your doctor before taking potassium supplements.  take potassium supplements in pill form.  try a powdered or liquid form of potassium.  consider intravenous potassium.

 The first course of action when dealing with stiffness in dogs – no matter the time of day – should be to talk to your vet. Your vet might be able to recommend solutions or managements techniques specific to your pet based on its health history and species.Your dog might be able to prescribe medication for your dog to help it cope with the stiffness in its joints. You should already have a vet for your older dog, but if you don’t, check online veterinary organization databases. The American Animal Hospital Association, for instance, has a searchable list of animal treatment centers at https://www.aaha.org/pet_owner/about_aaha/hospital_search/default.aspx.  If your vet thinks it is appropriate, you might be able to improve your dog’s morning stiffness through surgery. Canine surgeons can provide added stability to joints and remove bits of bone that may have chipped off over time. Smaller dogs might benefit from having certain leg joints fused, or having the top portion of upper leg bones removed.Talk to your doctor to determine if your dog needs surgery.  Dogs, like humans, can benefit tremendously from a good massage. Take your dog to a trained animal masseuse and explain that it experiences stiffness in the morning. Your dog might benefit from a good massage.Ask the masseuse for tips about how you might be able to provide a simple massage to your dog in the morning in order to reduce its stiffness. If possible, sit by and carefully watch the pet masseuse as they massage your doggie. Massaging your dog yourself can not only save time and money, but provide a great opportunity to improve the bond between you.  Acupuncture – the application of needles to various points on the body – isn’t just for people. This traditional Chinese health practice can make your dog more mobile and active in the morning, afternoon, or evening. Contact some traditional Chinese medical specialists and ask if they perform acupuncture on dogs. If they don’t, ask them if they know of another acupuncturist who does., Hydrotherapy is the application of assisted swimming in order to help dogs keep their muscles and joints active. Dogs can more easily move around in water than they can on land because in water, they float. While floating, stress on joints and muscles is reduced. A hydrotherapy session might use underwater treadmills or jet pools in order to help your dog improve use of its limbs and stay limber.Ask your vet for recommendations of doggie hydrotherapy centers near you.  

talk to your vet.  try surgery.  try massage therapy.  try acupuncture.  try hydrotherapy. 

 You may need to make the pieces shorter or longer depending on the size of your quilt, however.  Place the corner of the strip 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) down and 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) over.  Even though the self-adhesive Velcro should stay on the quilt by itself, a quick stitch will give it extra support.  The strips should be on the inside of the wallpaper frame, about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) in and 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) down to match the location of the strips on the quilt.  The Velcro pieces should be evenly aligned, and the quilt should fit perfectly inside the wallpaper border.  

cut four pieces of self-adhesive velcro.the width of the velcro should be pre-set at 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) and you should cut lengths of about 2 inches (5 cm) for a 36 by 36 inch (1 by 1 meter) quilt.  stick one side of each velcro strip in each corner of the quilt.  stitch the velcro in place.  stick the other side of each velcro strip on the wall.  align the velcro and stick together. 

 Before you can start a radon testing business, you'll need to know much more about its practice. This information can be found by researching radon online or by viewing the EPA's introductory guide at https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-05/documents/hmbuygud.pdf. Links to more articles and additional sources can be found at https://www.epa.gov/radon. Focus on learning important facts, such as:   According to the EPA, all homes and schools below the third floor are at risk for high levels of radon. Buildings in certain areas of the country are more susceptible to high levels of radon. EPA guidelines state that any result over 4.0 pCi/L (picocuries per liter) represents an unsafe level of radon.; , There are 2 types of radon testing kits: short-term and long-term testing kits. Short-term kits test the radon levels in a home for a period of time between 2 and 90 days, depending on the type of kits. Long-term kits stay in a home for over 90 days and offer a more accurate reading of the year-round radon levels in a home.   All radon kits should be placed on the lowest lived-in area of a home or building. Place them at least 20 inches (50 cm) off the floor and away from exterior walls, drafts, and high humidity or heat.There are many different types of radon test kits, each with different specific benefits and drawbacks. Read through the different types at http://www.nrsb.org/devices.asp.  Some states regulate radon professionals independently or EPA guidelines. These states may require those who measure or those mitigate radon levels, or both, to obtain and maintain a license to do so. Others may simply require them to register. In any case, you'll need to check with the appropriate regulatory body in your state to find out what its requirements are.State requirements can be found by visiting https://certi.us/cms/radon-training/state-radon-training-requirements and selecting your state.  Even if your state does not require you to be licensed, you should still seek professional certification to gain credibility with your customers. The National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) certifies radon professionals as part of the National Radon Proficiency Program (NRPP). Certified radon testers and mitigators are also listed on the NRPP's website, making you more visible to potential customers.To become certified, you will need to take a qualifying education course and then pass a certification exam. At this point you can apply for NRPP certification. There are two different measurement (testing) certifications: standard services and standard and analysis services. The second includes a device performance test and the ability to analyze radon test results yourself rather than sending your device to a lab.  Certification courses can be found at http://aarst-nrpp.com/wp/entry-level-courses/. There are options that take place in actual classrooms and some that are done entirely online. Anyone looking to start a radon testing business should take and pass one of the radon measurement courses. The exam will be offered at the end of the in-class course or can be signed up for at http://www.psiexams.com/.   Courses are 16 hours in total and cover everything from the science behind radon creation to choosing a test device and analyzing results. Exams are typically 100 multiple choice questions, which you will have 2 hours to complete. Exam fees are $110.00.Certifications last for two years, after which point they can be renewed with the appropriate continuing education., Research whether there's a need for a radon testing business in your area.

 Set aside a time when all family members come together around the kitchen table, or some other comfortable spot, away from the TV. Let everyone know that you're wanting to talk about the TV viewing habits of all the family, without singling out anybody. If anything, being very honest about your own TV viewing habits and your own desire to minimize the amount of viewing is an excellent way to help everyone else see that you're not lecturing but aiming to pave the way to improved viewing habits. At the same time though, don't lose sight of the fact that as a parent or guardian, you are responsible for children in your household, including teenagers, and knowing what and how much they're watching is an important part of your responsibility.   Realize that some members of the family may approach the family talk with unhappiness, or they may feel threatened that they are "under scrutiny". Aim to keep the family talk lighthearted but serious in intent at the same time.       Have some favorite nibbles or snacks at the table to help everyone feel at ease. It is very important that the TV is not on during the family discussion!; , A little internet searching will bring back some astonishing figures on the amount of time families spend watching TV, as well as the types of shows, etc., being watched by different age groups. It will possibly be an eye-opener for you too. Perhaps print off some statistics to share with your family, or even make a few charts if that's something you enjoy doing, to help them understand your points of concern.   Part of your fact-gathering mission may be to convince you and/or your spouse as to the value of TV for your family. Knowledge about the impacts of TV viewing and what constitutes "too much" viewing is an important part of realizing whether or not your family has a problem with the amount of TV watching you're doing.       For example: Did you know that many parents aren't even aware of what the ratings guidelines mean, with only 12 percent knowing that "FV" in the USA ("fantasy violence") relates to violent content, while eight percent of people think it stands for "family viewing"?Did you know that the American Psychiatric Association considers that exposure to media portrayals of violence increases the instances of aggressiveness and anti-social behavior in children?Did you know that obesity levels in children are in part linked to the 24 hours plus weekly viewing of TV, 24 hours that could in part be put toward physical exercise activities?Too much TV viewing may also contribute to concentration deficit disorders, impoverished academic performance, lessened imagination, and reading problems., A moral tirade about the "evils" of TV will cause some members of the family to rebel and not listen to your concerns or preferences. It is much better to present the basic facts, to crack a few jokes that highlight the problem, and to encourage family members to think about what they're missing out on because of TV than to simply slam TV as "no good". After all, the idea is to minimize TV viewing, to teach good self-discipline habits in relation to it, rather than to cutting it out totally. In doing so, you also teach children and young people about self-control, delayed gratification, and making sensible choices about the tools in their lives, and treating it as a lesson in how to manage tools rather than having tools manage them is something they'll need to have a handle on for life.  Think about sparking an open discussion with open-ended questions, such as:   How do you guys feel about your own TV viewing habits at the moment?       How many hours are you watching at the moment, do you think? How much of this do you really enjoy? How much is ads, waiting for subsequent shows, opening sequences, and, especially with news, delay to "force" you to continue to watch? What sorts of things do you think you might be doing instead of watching TV? If we did what the "cool" people on TV are doing, would we enjoy the real consequences? Would we even look healthy without the extensive makeovers they get? Do we want to keep being suggested to do those things? Do the TV ads often tell us about things that make our lives better? Or do they just try to make us feel bad about things we can buy affordably for what they are, rather than for what someone tries to make them seem? Do you think we're doing enough things together as a family? If so, why? If not, why not? What could we do better together?  , For many family members, TV has become a source of relaxation, distraction, and switching off from working or studying hard. For others, it's a source of convenience that lets them get some peace and quiet to get work done while others quietly watch TV. And this will cause some family members to feel that being asked to watch less TV is attacking their relaxation or daily household routine options. While acknowledging that TV seems to have become a relaxation or distraction habit in your family, it can be helpful to tell the family that this is a "brainstorming" session, where every single family member has a role in expressing their feelings about TV viewing as a household, and to share ideas about what they'd like to do to reduce TV consumption. It is suggested that following presenting your concerns about how TV has been sucking away time for doing other things, and after asking the open-ended questions suggested above, you open up a discussion about the alternatives that were raised as answers to the previous step, and suggest a few of your own. Some suggestions might include:   Spending the evening mealtime together, even if it is staggered between age groups or people's different comings and goings. And this mealtime should be TV-free. Part of the meal can, but need not always, be the preparation. Enjoy "slow eating", getting back to the place where food becomes a source of togetherness and experiencing the joy of talking and eating with one another.       Getting out together as a family more often. You could go to the park, go on a picnic, go to the movies, go to a sports game, go hiking, go ten-pin bowling, go for a walk around the harbor, visit a museum, visit the library, paint a community mural, join a community gardening project, and so forth. Learning a new sport together. If everyone's feeling frustrated, why not get the whole family to enroll in a martial art or a team sport, or get into something like triathlon or marathon training as a family.  As suggested by the Turnoff Week campaign, suggest that everyone just take a week off viewing to see how things feel and how they can change without TV being involved. Pull the plug from the wall and go out and do other things for the week. At the end of this period, have a round-up of what family members have done instead of watching TV. Share the experience with one another and share the excitement and enlightenment of doing other things than simply TV every day.   As part of this, cease talking about TV shows and characters altogether. It's very easy to confuse people we "know of" with people we "know" for real in today's media-filled world. Help children and other family members recognize the difference and discourage them from relating to TV stars, commentators, and newsreaders as people they "know". This sense of familiarity can be devastating if a person truly believes they are part of the TV family and less a part of a real life family, so spot the signs of too much reliance on what "so and so on TV says" and start gently reminding the person who is so besotted that the person on TV is not real family and that there is no real way of ever knowing what that person truly says or does off TV!, Why not set aside a time when the family all gathers together in one cozy or breezy (depending on the time of year) part of the house for an hour of just reading together. Make it a tradition of doing it at least once a week. You can choose whether to read out aloud in turns from different favorite books, or just to read in silence together. This can be a great excuse to have lovely hot or cold drinks and a few delicious snacks as well.   This can be a great time to read the newspaper out loud, so that everyone gets the news without having to read it singly; especially good for the large weekend editions! As a benefit, local newspapers often cover much more than the local TV news ever will.Or try passing out the sections of a serious big-city newspaper and reading it silently for half an hour. You'll all be amazed at how much more you see than in a half-hour of TV news.  Set aside one night a week in which all family members get together to do something together. It might be going out, playing sport, playing board or card games, talking, reading, or even planning a vacation together. Whatever it is, just ensure it's minus the TV and any other electronic devices.  Suggest that from this point on, that TV viewing become a conscious act focused on quality and not quantity. Favorite shows can be included in this "quality" (after all, it's a fairly subjective interpretation given what's usually on TV) but they must fit within a set amount of time. Once the time is up, the TV goes off for that family member.   Another suggestion is to compromise on TV viewing days. Sometimes there may be a day where a family member has all the shows they love at once, and this could be "their" TV night, and the rest of the week becomes non-TV time.       Try to find quality programs the family as-a-whole can sit down and enjoy, something that covers all ages, such as documentaries, cartoons, etc. And instead of simply watching the show, talk about it at the end, to get everyone's opinions and to ask them if they think the show has taught them anything, or what they would have preferred to have seen on the show, etc. Encourage critical discussion of TV shows as part of teaching children and teens critical thinking skills and not just accepting shows for what they are or simply liking or disliking a show - encourage them to voice the reasons behind their reaction. You don't have to limit yourself to what the TV stations provide: there are all kinds of high-quality, free programs, including audiobookson the Internet.  If you haven't got doors or shutters to close over the TV, get a cloth to cover the TV for when the family has agreed it is not to be turned on. Shutting away or hiding the TV creates a ritual and the act on turning on the TV requires every family member to think about it before doing it.   Make the people, not the TV, the "center of gravity" in your main room. Don't arrange the chairs all facing the TV: instead, arrange them facing a central area and one another, with the TV off to one side. That way people in many of the seats can watch the TV fairly comfortably if they really want to, but will default to interacting with one another rather than watching it idly. The TV can be loud enough for whoever really wants to watch it and thus probably sits closest at a given time without being overwhelmingly loud for others.       Give the remote control a specific home near the TV. That way, anyone who wants to turn on the TV has to get up to get it and make a conscious decision about turning on the TV. It is also a good idea to switch off the TV after every use rather than leaving it on stand-by. Not only does this save on power but again it causes the person to think before turning on the TV.  It can be a good idea to have a monthly to quarterly review of what everyone has managed to do without TV taking up so much time, as a family reminder of the importance of putting TV in its place. Use this opportunity to praise family members for their dedication to being involved in a variety of activities, and for their self-disciplined approach toward TV viewing.  

have a family discussion about tv usage.  spend some time thinking about what you're going to say and having some facts and statistics on hand to back up your concerns.  do your best to avoid "demonizing" the tv.  start the discussion rolling.  be understanding of the barriers involved but be ready to suggest alternatives.  suggest that the family go cold turkey for a week.  encourage reading times together as a family.  organize one family night a week.  aim to allot viewing times.  find a way of visually signaling down time from the tv.  have a review now and then. 

 Some children learn best by being shown what to do. Though you may not be able to communicate with your child verbally, you can communicate through action. Potty with your child in the room so they can understand the basic premise of the whole idea.If you have another toddler or child in the home, let your child observe them pottying. This will help them understand the process more readily since they are closer in age and size.  Though your child may not be able to hear you, they can often make sense of the world easily by using visuals. Create a chart, picture, or flash cards that depict the pottying process for your child. The first step might be for them to remove their underwear, then sit on the potty, then pee or poop, and then put on their clothes again and wash their hands., One way to help potty train your hard of hearing child is to make a game of the process. Put a ping pong ball or some other eye catching object that you don’t mind dirtying up in the toilet. Have your child aim at it by peeing on it. Though this exercise will work best for boys, some parents of girls might find it useful, as well. 

allow them to observe you pottying.  use pictures.  make a game of it. 

 The best way to ensure you won’t look at internet porn is to eliminate the source—the internet. Put away your smartphone, tablet, and computer, or give them to a friend or family member for safekeeping. Spend a few days away from the internet and allow your mind and body to detox.   Try doing this with a friend. Spend a full day with a friend in which both of you leave your devices at home and do not use them at all. Having someone else’s support might make the process easier.If you are giving up your smartphone, temporarily switch to a disposable cell phone in the meantime. You can buy them just about anywhere, including most gas stations. Give this number to the people you talk to regularly so they can still contact you. Make sure you pick a disposable phone that does not have internet access.; , If you are privately insured, look for a provider in your network. Some other therapists in your area may offer their services on a sliding scale. Do some research on your chosen therapist and see if one of their specializations is addiction.   There are online resources for overcoming pornography addiction. You can download e-books, or even seek e-counseling over the internet. The downside with this option is that you will need to access the internet to access these services and products., Find something new to do that you enjoy, particularly something that will get you out of the house, or at least out of the area in which you normally access internet pornography. Whenever you get the urge to access these materials, choose instead to do something new.If you find this challenging, consider how much time you spend watching or viewing internet porn, and consider what you could get done with that amount of time if you spent it doing something productive and engaging. Many former internet pornography addicts say that finding new activities to engage their minds with has allowed them to improve their quality of life, and feel like more productive and useful people.  If you traditionally use internet pornography to become sexually stimulated, try using your own imagination to turn yourself on. If you are in a relationship, focus on your partner. Imagine some fantasies and put yourself back into the physical world.   You might have noticed that when you view internet porn, you are doing so very passively—watching other people act out your fantasies or sexual thoughts. If you take that role on yourself, you might find it more engaging and satisfying.  Keeping a serious addiction problem from your partner can jeopardize your relationship, and the trust your partner has in you. Be honest and open with them about your struggles, and continue to talk with them through your recovery.Understand that your addiction will affect your partner’s life, whether you notice it or not. Any addiction can put a strain on a relationship, as the other partner tries to understand what you are going through. Your partner may feel shocked, betrayed, or even confused by your addiction. But, it is important not to ignore their feelings as you work through recovery.Express to your partner that you need and value their support. Your partner may even need to attend therapy, in conjunction with your own. Consider couples’ therapy as an option.  If you take the measure to automatically block all pornographic material from your electronic, internet-enabled devices, the temptation to view pornography may be more limited, and easier to avoid.   Ask your partner or a close friend to set the password, rather than setting it yourself. This way, even if you want to unlock the blocks or filters, you won’t have the access to do so.  Some options include Google Chrome and Firefox. These browsers contain the capability to block certain types of websites, and are safe for your computer.   Both Google Chrome and Firefox offer add-ons or extensions that you can install within your browser to block pornographic websites and pop-ups. Once you have downloaded your chosen browser, visit the add-ons or extension database for that browser and install a blocker to your browser.Turn on the pop-up blocker in your chosen web browser. This way, if a pornographic pop-up advertisement is generated by any web page, it will be blocked by your browser automatically.  With Google, this option is available under the “Settings” button on the right side of the search page. Click “Turn on SafeSearch” to activate this setting.The safe search setting will block all kinds of different inappropriate search results, including pornographic websites. It blocks the results in all search categories, including images. You can turn this function on and off very easily, but there is also an option to lock it in place with a password or pin. If you want to block these search results from other people in the household, use the lock option.  You can access internet pornography from any device that is connected to the web, including smartphones and tablets. Make sure you enable these safe search and blocker capabilities across all of your devices.   Check the manual on your smartphone or tablet on how to install these blockers. How you install and use them will depend on which phone model you have, and which browser is installed on it., Most email service providers have a dedicated spam folder that automatically filters suspicious email messages, but it’s important that you don’t open any of these messages, click any links in them, or download any attachments. If you receive an email from a suspicious account or an address you don’t recognize, avoid accessing any material it contains.   Up to 25% of all spam emails contain pornographic material. By avoiding opening or accessing material in these spam messages, you can protect your devices from pornographic material, and also from any viruses that these spam emails sometimes contain.Don’t respond to these messages. Responding will validate to the spam sender that your account is active, and that spammer might continue to use, sell, and spam your email address.  You can use a number of free and effective anti-malware and anti-spyware programs to scan your hard drive for viruses and remove them. Having certain malware on your computer could be setting you at a higher risk to get pornographic pop-up ads, so erasing them from your hard drive is important.   Free programs like BitDefender are easy to download and use, and will effectively protect your computer from malware and spyware that can make your device more vulnerable to viruses.  This extends from both internet usage on laptops and computers, to accessing the internet via a smartphone, tablet, or other handheld device.   Talking to your children is the first line of defense when it comes to keeping them safe from internet pornography. Let them know your views on accessing this kind of material, and what kind of things you think are inappropriate for them to see.Set consequences for breaking these rules. Make sure your children understand that they are not allowed to access these materials, regardless of the circumstance.  Even with certain blocks in place, some young people have found ways around them. Searching for things like “childbirth” or “breastfeeding” can often generate search results that slip through the pornography filter, but are still inappropriate for your children to see.Check to make sure your children haven’t figured out how to unlock any filters or blocks you have installed. Make sure you have used passwords or pins that they would not be able to guess. Keep browser security up to date. If you browser needs an update, make sure you download and install it. These security features will help block pop-up ads that may contain pornographic material as well.  If your family members have their own computers or laptops, ask that they use them with their bedroom doors open, or out in a more public area.Since smaller devices like smartphones or tablets can be more difficult to monitor, try to limit your child’s time with these devices. You might even ask that they leave their smartphones and tablets out of their bedrooms at bed time. 

take a break from the internet.  seek the help of a therapist.  try some new hobbies.  use your imagination.  keep an open, honest dialogue with your partner.  set up blocks and filters on your own devices.  download and use a reliable and safe web browser.  set your search engine on “safe search” mode.  install the same blockers on any other internet-enabled devices.  do not open spam emails.  run a security check on your computer.  talk to your children and set rules for internet usage.  keep an eye on your childrens’ browser histories.  keep the family computer in a public area of the house. 

 If you've memorized how Minecraft Steve looks, you might be able to skip this step. In most cases, however, it'll be a good idea to find a few pictures online to use as a reference.   You can look at the game itself for a reference image or do an Internet search using your favorite search engine. Looking for "Minecraft Steve images" should be enough. Once you find a few good pictures, print them out or keep them open on your computer screen. Refer to these images as you work.; , You will need several shades of brown, beige, and white.   You do not need to use blue paper for the eyes since the eyes will eventually be cut out, anyway. The more shades you use, the more accurate the Steve head will look. At minimum, try to find white, beige, tan, light brown, brown, dark brown, and reddish brown.  Use a paper cutter or paper trimmer to cut the construction paper into 2-inch (5-cm) squares.You will only need two white squares (one to go on either side of the eye holes). Cut a relatively even number of squares from the remaining construction paper. You will need a total of 320 squares. Scissors can be used if you do not have a paper cutter, but make sure your sides are as even and straight as possible. Note that these squares are sized for a 16-inch (40-cm) cubical box. If the box you use is larger or smaller, you will need to adjust the size of the squares accordingly. The squares will be arranged into an 8-inch by 8-inch (20-cm by 20-cm) grid, so you will need to divide the length of one side of your box by eight to determine how long/wide the paper squares should be.  Arrange the squares into five separate groups on a flat working surface. Piece them together so that they resemble the face, back, sides, and top of Steve's head.The squares must be arranged into 8-inch by 8-inch (20-cm by 20-cm) sides. Use the darker brown shades for Steve's hair and the lighter browns and beige shades for Steve's skin. Leave blank space for the eyes approximately four grid spaces from the bottom and three grid spaces from either side.  Mark the center of the box on all four sides by drawing a grid. Do the same for the top of the box.   Use a ruler and pencil to draw a line down the vertical center of each side, then draw a line down the horizontal center of each side. The point of intersection will be the center of that side. If necessary, you should also take this time to fold the flaps of the open side into the box and out of the way.  Carefully glue the paper squares onto each side of the box using a glue stick or hot glue gun.   Work on one side at a time, using the grid to guide you as you place the squares. Remember to leave blank spaces for the eyes. If using a glue stick, you'll need to apply glue to the entire back of each piece. If using a hot glue gun, only apply glue to the corners of each piece. Allow all glue to dry before continuing to the next step.  Find the blank spaces you left for the eyes. Use a craft knife or utility knife to cut out the cardboard there, creating eye holes.   Keep the sides straight by placing a ruler along each edge as you cut.  Form a loop with heavy-duty packing tape and stick it to the top of a cap. Stick the other side of the tape to the center of box from inside.   The cap is not strictly necessary, but it can help the head stay stable on the wearer's head. Make sure that front of the cap faces the face-side of the head.  The Steve head should now be done and ready to wear.  

find a few reference images.  gather several shades of construction paper.  cut the paper into small squares.  arrange the squares.  draw a grid onto the box.  glue the squares onto each side of the box.  cut out spaces for the eyes.  attach a cap to the inside.  try it on. 

 Do it 1 or 2 articles at a time. Keep in mind that most article directory services have the right to refuse, edit or not approve your article.   The best article directory strategy is to make SEO articles part of your Internet marketing funnel; that way you are constantly submitting them in an effort to expand your reach. This can also help you to improve the quality of the articles over time.  Many business web hosting companies already include this in their analytic and report software; however, you can also start a free account with Google Analytics and embed a special website tracking link, if it is allowed by the article directory. Keeping track of new website traffic will allow you to keep track of your ROI.  In some cases, articles can be reworked, using similar information to inform people about a new topic. Track the web traffic created by these websites.  Accounts usually benefit from providing educational content, and it will help extend the article's reach. If it gets shared or Re-Tweeted, then new clients are likely to arrive at your site.  Do this after 1 month and after 3 months. Analyze the ROI of this Internet marketing investment, and decide if it is high enough to continue.   If the ROI is low, then discontinue posting new articles. Article directory marketing does not work for every type of business. If the ROI is high, then ask more employees to get involved with article writing, and begin registering and posting with new article directories. You will find that some of them produce better results than others.  

submit your articles to the directory.  make sure your website is set up to track web traffic that originates from the article directory's site.  post different articles on 2 or 3 more article directories.  share your best articles on social media sites, like twitter, facebook and linkedin.  ask your marketing department to research any increase in web traffic provided by article directories. 

 Floral eyeliner is usually made with colorful liners. Go for things like pinks, purples, greens, reds, and yellows. This will help give your dots a flowery feel.Make sure you have at least one green or yellow eyeliner. You will need these to create buds for your flowers.  To start, you'll be creating a backdrop of white flowers. Start with a single white flower on the outer corner of your eye. To create a flower, use the tip of your eyeliner brush to draw five small dots in a circle. Leave a small hole in the center of the circle. You will fill this in later to create the bud of your flower.Do your best, but keep in mind not all your circles will be completely uniform. Just as flowers have petals of different sizes and shapes, it's okay if your circles are a little mismatched.  Right next to your first flower, add another flower stemming away from your eye. Make this one slightly smaller by using smaller dots. Moving outward and upward slightly, make another flower with even smaller dots connected to the second one.The line the flowers follow should be similar to a cat eye you would make with a regular eyeliner look. It should be a small wing of flowers moving outward and upward slightly in a diagonal line.  On top of your first line of flowers, draw another line of flowers. These ones should be all be slightly smaller than the first three flowers you drew. The line of flowers should lead back to your eye. It should end on the top of your lash line just near the corner of your eye.Again, your flowers may not be perfectly uniform. It can be particularly difficult to draw totally uniform flowers when you're making tiny dots, but mismatched flowers can make for a more realistic floral look.  Draw a line of white flowers across your lash line. Draw the flowers in clusters of two, so you have two rows of white flowers running along your lash line as you go. Vary the size and shapes of the flowers to add some spontaneity to the look.Remember, you make flowers by drawing five dots in a circle.  Take a brighter color, such as a purple or pink. Starting on the line stemming outward, draw a few flowers here and there over the white flowers. Again, make flowers by drawing circles of five dots. Have the colored flowers overlap the white flowers slightly. Continue adding colored flowers about halfway down your lash line.The number of colored flowers you want is up to you. Some people prefer only a splash of colored flowers while others like 50/50 ratio of colorful and white flowers.  On a paper plate or similar surface, add a dab of your white eyeliner. Then, add a dab of your colorful eyeliner. Using a clean eyeliner brush, mix the colors together slightly., Using the new color you created, add flowers along the remainder of your lash line. Again, have them overlap slightly with the white flowers and add as many light colored flowers as you prefer., Take a yellow eyeliner. Using an eyeliner brush, dab the center of each flower with a dot of yellow. This should make it clear the cluster of dots are flowers, as they now all have buds.Keep in mind, not every flower will get a bud. Some flowers overlap, covering the hole in the center of the dots.  

opt for colorful liners.  add a white flower to your outer corner.  add two flowers branching outward.  work your way back in with smaller flowers.  add flowers all along your lash line.  use a brighter color to draw on colorful flowers.  mix your white eyeliner with your colorful eyeliner.  add lighter colored flowers.  finish up with buds. 

 Avoid shriveled, dried up or moldy berries. Avoid soggy strawberries too as this means they are past their prime. A good strawberry should be firm and shiny. (Choose organic, if available, as strawberries are listed on the "Dirty Dozen" list of fruits and veggies most pesticide-laden.)   Some cooks believe smaller strawberries have more flavor due to a higher concentration of sugars.; , Rub the berries gently under running water to make sure each berry is clean and free of as much soil as possible. Most strawberries sold at the grocery store are fairly clean so a good rinsing should do the trick. ,, Sweeten with a sprinkling of superfine sugar if desired, and use within two hours of preparation. Keep the strawberries refrigerated until ready to serve.  They will keep for up to 7 days after purchase. Do not wash and prepare the strawberries until ready to use.  

select bright, fresh looking berries.  rinse strawberries under running water but do not soak them.  let drain in a colander or place on paper towels.  ,  hull the berries by removing the green cap and stem with a paring knife or a strawberry huller.  ,  slice the strawberries.  store strawberries in the refrigerator. 

 Smiling makes other people happy, and someone else might want to smile if you do.; , Jokes can make someone smile really easily, as long as they're funny.  Hugs make someone so happy they could just drop to the ground.  If you show polite behavior, this will make others happier.

 Make sure that your bottoms give you a full range of motion. Be conscious of how much you will sweat during your workout, and think about how hot you're going to get.   Try not to wear shorts that extend more than an inch below your knees – especially if they are loose around the legs. The lower your shorts, the shorter your range of motion., A cotton t-shirt or tank will suffice. Alternately, choose a breathable, sweat-wicking polyester shirt. Pick something that will absorb sweat and that won't restrict your range of motion.A tank will show off your arms, and a t-shirt can be a slightly more modest choice. Decide what you're going for., This can be the most comfortable, most breathable solution. Make sure to read the vibe of the gym before you strip down. There are usually no rules against male shirtlessness – but you may stand out more if you're working out at a smaller gym or if you are the only one shirtless.   Some gyms do have a code against going shirtless. Read the rules beforehand!  , The shoes you wear will depend upon the sort of exercises that you're doing. If you plan to do any cardio, then bring shoes that will offer plenty of protection for your feet and legs.   If you'll be running on a treadmill, then make sure to bring running shoes. If you will be using an elliptical or exercise bike, then your footwear doesn't matter so much – just wear something comfortable that you can stand in. If you'll be training weights, make sure to wear something with ample ankle and arch support. Running shoes are always a good choice.  

wear shorts or sweats.  take a breathable, flexible shirt.  go shirtless, depending on the gym.  choose appropriate footwear. 

 To build this toy gun, you will need a wooden 2x4 length of board, a saw, black tape, sandpaper, a drill and screws.; , Start with a 2x4 piece of wood about 60 centimeter (23.6 in) long. Cut the board into two pieces, one 40 centimeter (15.7 in) and the other 20 centimeter (7.9 in) long. Place the longer board in a vice.  Place the hole in the center of the plank about 9 centimeter (3.5 in) away from one end of the board.  You should wrap tape around the board from the opposite end of the hole to just before you reach the hole. Make sure the hole is still exposed.  Place the longer board over the smaller, making sure the hole is on top. The boards should be positioned to form a right angle. Just envision the longer board as the barrel and the shorter board as the stock of a gun.  Using your drill, attach a small screw though the previously-drilled hole and into the shorter board underneath. Be sure the head of the screw is larger than the hole so it doesn't slip through.  You can either sand the "stock" of the toy gun, wrap it with black tape or leave it as it is. Feel free to add further decoration with paint or markers. If your child likes playing cowboys or armies, this would be a great birthday or Christmas present.   You can make the gun a more realistic toy by adding a "trigger." Glue a wooden clothespin under the "barrel" of the toy gun, making sure that the shorter "clip" end is pointed outward. Later, your child can even stretch a rubber band from the clothes pin to the end of the gun's "barrel," releasing and "shooting" the rubber band by opening the clothespin "trigger." 

set up your workstation.  saw the board into two pieces.  drill a 2 centimeter (0.8 in) hole in the wood.  wrap black tape around the board.  connect the two boards.  screw the boards together.  finish the toy. 

 Character clowns are simply clowns that look like exaggerated versions of people, stereotypes, or emotions. For example, the classic "sad clown" look is a type of character clown. You could also be a perplexed clown, an angry clown, a doctor clown, or a sexy clown - you get the picture.  Spread a thin layer of white base makeup on your face. Use the makeup sponge to evenly distribute the white base makeup to all areas of your face, covering your eyebrows as well. Most clowns will stop the application of the base makeup at their hairline, slightly below the jaw line and right in front of the earlobes.   Even out inconsistencies in the base makeup. Take a closer look at your base makeup and retouch any areas that have more or less makeup on them by patting them with the makeup sponge. Remember to set your base makeup using theatrical face powder and a powder puff.  Based on the character you have chosen to become, apply different colors of makeup and makeup designs to areas of your face you want to highlight.   If you're going to be a sad clown, choose a color to outline a frown around your mouth and down to your chin. Sad clowns often have black paint on the bottom half of their face, around the mouth, to indicate that they are unshaven. If you want to be a perplexed clown, draw a thick, cocked eyebrow on your forehead, and a regular eyebrow on the other side. To be a sexy clown, draw exaggerated black eyelashes above and blow your eyes, and use red to make large, luscious lips.  Patting the powder puff on each different colored area will ensure the colors won't run together.  Double check your clown makeup to make sure the lines are sharp and the colors aren't bleeding into the surrounding makeup.  

choose a character.  make your face into a canvas.  create exaggerated features.  set your makeup each time you add a color.  smooth or fill in any inconsistencies. 

 Measure portions and be mindful of calories so you can maintain a healthy weight. If you gain weight, are overweight or obese your risk for heart disease increases.If you're looking to avoid foods that could damage your heart, you should also focus on foods and an eating pattern that can protect your heart. Measuring the appropriate portion sizes of foods and counting calories can help keep your weight in check or even help you lose weight. Your total meal portion size should be between one to two cups total. Use a food scale or measuring cups to keep yourself on track. You may also want to count calories. You can use an online calculator to figure out how many calories you need daily. In general women need about 1,800 calories daily and men need about 2,200 calories daily., Since trans fats, saturated fats and red meat should either be avoided or minimized in your diet, you'll need to focus on other protein sources instead. Stick to lean protein options to help support your healthy weight and your heart.   Lean proteins are naturally lower in calories and fat - especially the unhealthy types of fat.This makes them a preferable choice for your heart healthy diet. Leaner protein sources include: poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy, lean cuts of beef, lean pork, seafood, tofu and legumes. Also make sure to measure your protein. Measure out about 3–4 oz or about a 1/2 cup of items like beans or lentils., Although fats like trans fat and saturated fat are things you want to avoid or minimize, there are actually some types of fat that you want to include in your diet. These are typically referred to as "heart healthy" fats.   There are two groups of heart healthy fats that you should focus on: monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Both offer great benefits to your heart.Monounsaturated fats are found in foods like: olive oil, canola oil, sesame oil and peanut oil. Cook with these oils, use them in salad dressings or drizzle over steamed vegetables. Polyunsaturated fats include omega-3 fats and are found in foods like: salmon, mackerel, tuna, avocado, nuts and seeds. Include fatty fish a few times a week, add avocados to your salad or top your yogurt with nuts or seeds.  In addition to including lean protein and healthy fats, you want to aim to make half of your plate a fruit or a vegetable. Both of these food groups are heart healthy foods.   Fruits and vegetables are great for your heart and overall health. They're low in calories but high in fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.When you make half of your meals a fruit or vegetable, you help control the overall calories and nutrition of your meal. The antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables (not antioxidant supplements) have been shown to have a protective effect against your heart.Also measure out the portion sizes for your fruits and vegetables. You should go for 1 cup of vegetables, 2 cups of salad greens and 1/2 cup of fruit., 100% whole grain foods are not only good for your GI system, but also great for your heart and arteries.Make sure when you're choosing to eat a grain, you go for whole grain to reap these great benefits.   100% whole grains are minimally processed and still include all 3 nutritious parts of the grain — the bran, germ and endosperm. These grains are high in fiber, minerals and even protein.Eating appropriate servings of whole grains can help reduce your risk of heart disease, diabetes, stroke and helps maintain a healthy weight.Make sure to measure your grains. Go for about 1 oz or 1/2 cup of cooked grains per serving., You might be surprised that drinking adequate fluids is also important for a healthy heart. Drink up to help maintain good heart health.   If you're dehydrated, it's harder for your heart to pump blood. It's puts a big strain on your heart making it work harder and beat faster. When you're properly hydrated, your heart pumps blood easily to the muscles.To make sure you're getting adequate fluids, aim to consume a minimum for 64 oz or 8 glasses daily. However, many people may need upwards of 13 glasses daily.Stick with sugar-free and decaf beverages like water, sparkling water, flavored water or decaf coffee or tea.  

eat appropriate portion sizes and total calories for your body.  go for lean protein sources.  include a source of healthy fats every day.  make half your plate a fruit or vegetable.  choose only whole grain foods.  drink adequate amounts of clear fluids. 

 Your kid will most likely have to look at the device for hours either for reading lectures or taking down lesson notes. Pick one that has a large screen, enough that it wouldn’t strain their eyes even after using it for long periods.   Android devices like Samsung Galaxy Tabs or Google Nexus tablets should fit the requirements. If the school required the purchase, then ask the administration if there’s any particular unit that you need to buy. This will save you time on having to figure out which Android unit to get.; , If your kid’s going to use the Android device just for entertainment purposes like video games, listening to music, and watching videos, then basic units like the entry level Samsung Galaxy series (Fame, Y, etc.) should be enough as it has enough hardware power to support most Android app games.  If your child needs to use the Android device for special cases like supplementing physical disabilities, then you need to base the unit you’re going to buy on the specific situation you have.   In example, if your kid has speech defects or is mute and needs a device to aid him or her to communicate, buy an Android tablet—or any unit—with a large screen that he or she can use to conveniently write messages on.  Your child won’t need extremely expensive Android gadgets, even if they’re going to use it for school. You also have to take into consideration that they won’t be able to take care of it as much as you could. Buy one that won’t be too expensive to replace in case it gets lost or damaged.  Consider your kid’s physical attributes. You don’t want your five year-old son or daughter dragging a massive 10-inch tablet around the house, school, or anywhere they need to go. Buy a unit that they can easily carry and use anywhere, anytime.   Android devices are known for portability and mobility so this should be one of the factors that you need to consider.  Get an Android device that’s lightweight and easy to carry around.   The Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro series are all lightweight and extremely thin. Your kid would hardly notice it inside their bags.  The storage capacity of the device you’re going to purchase depends on how your kid will be using it. If it’s for school, buy a unit with enough space to save all their lessons.   Every Android brands have units that have expandable memory feature wherein you can use an external memory card to expand its storage capacity. Ask the salesperson if the Android device you’re going to purchase has this feature.  If your child’s going to use it out of the house most of the time, then pick a device that has a longer lasting battery life and will take some considerable amount of time before it needs to be recharged.   LG Android phones, like the G series, are known for its long battery life span.  

use it for education.  use it for entertainment.  use it for special cases.  check the price.  consider the size.  note the weight of the device.  think about memory storage.  scrutinize the battery life. 

 There are a number of factors that can put you at risk of stomach cancer. Some are not within your control, while others you can avoid. The risk factors that you have no control over include:   A family history of stomach cancer. A genetic predisposition to stomach cancer. Inherited genetic conditions, such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC), familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), Lynch syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, or BRCA gene mutations. Having type A blood, though the exact reason for this risk is unknown.; , There are certain situations where you may have been exposed to ionized radiation. This can increase your risk of stomach cancer, especially if the exposure was prolonged or happened numerous times. If you can control your exposure to any radiation, do so. Situations where you may have been exposed to radiation include:   Radioisotope radiation for thyroid cancer. External beam radiation for Hodgkin disease. Being in locations where an atomic bomb has gone off., There are certain jobs that can increase your risk for stomach cancer. Cancer can be caused by working with many different harmful chemicals, such as asbestos, cadmium, radon, benzene, arsenic, vinyl chloride, beryllium, chromium, and nickel compounds.The amount of risk depends on the level of exposure, the amount of time exposed, and the strength of the carcinogen you are exposed to. These jobs include:   The rubber industry. Construction. Woodworking. Mining. Painting. Pesticide work. The chemical industry. The dye industry., There are certain conditions, situations, and viruses that may make you more susceptible to stomach cancer. If you have a history of these, you may want to talk to your doctor about the likelihood of stomach cancer. These conditions include:   Previous bacterial infection from the Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) bacteria, which causes inflammation, ulcers, and pre-cancerous changes in the stomach. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is also a risk factor for cancer of the esophagus. Pernicious anemia, a decrease in the number of red blood cells that occurs when Vitamin B12 cannot be absorbed. Chronic atrophic gastritis, which is when the lining of your stomach becomes inflamed. Other stomach conditions, including intestinal metaplasia and gastric epithelial dysplasia. Metaplasia is the change in cell morphology to a more dysplastic (abnormal) form, which is potentially reversible. Dysplasia is the spread of an abnormal cell type and it is usually due to the cancerous properties of a cell. History of stomach surgeries such as a partial gastrectomy, which of the removal of part of the stomach. Epstein-Barr virus infection. Cystic fibrosis. 

determine if you have inherent risk factors.  limit your exposure to radiation.  protect yourself from carcinogenic chemicals.  check for a history of certain conditions. 

 The oven needs to heat up a bit before you stick the steaks in. Turn the broiler on to preheat the oven while you complete the other steps. You need the broiler because the high heat helps brown the outside of the steak without overcooking the steak., You can really use any seasonings you want, but a good steak seasoning should do the trick.Coarse salt, or salt of any kind, is always a good choice, as is freshly ground pepper and a bit of garlic powder. Make sure to season both sides of the steak with a heavy douse of seasoning., Place a cookie cooling rack on top of a sheet pan. A cooling rack is just what you use to put cookies on when they come out of the oven. The rack helps elevate the steak so it cooks more evenly. Put the steak or steaks on top of the rack., Place the steaks in the oven. Set a timer for 6 minutes. When it dings, take the steaks out so you can check them with a thermometer. They should be at about 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and they'll need about 3 more minutes. Flip them over, and place them back in the oven.Use tongs when flipping the steak, so you're not piercing it over and over with a fork. Always push the thermometer into the side of the steak to get a more accurate reading.  Pull the steaks out of the oven after 3 minutes, and use the thermometer to check the temperature again. See if it's at your desired doneness. If it's not, you'll need to stick the steaks back in the oven for another couple of minutes. Remember, the steak temperature may rise 5 degrees Fahrenheit or a bit more (up to 10 degrees) in the resting period after the oven, so aim for the lower end of your desired doneness.A rare steak is 120 degrees Fahrenheit to 125 degrees. Rare is 125 to 130 degrees, while medium rare is 130 to 135 degrees. Medium is 140 to 145, and medium well is 150 to 155. Well done is 160 or higher. Let the steak rest. Once your steak is at the desired temperature, you need to let it rest outside the oven for 5 minutes or so with aluminum foil loosely over it. The resting period is important because it lets the steak continue cooking, and it helps the steak retain its juices. If you cut it too soon, you'll release much of the juice onto the plate. 

turn the broiler on to heat up the oven.  season the steak liberally.  set up your pan.  cook the steaks for 6 minutes.  check the temperature again. 

 Many types of batteries contain hazardous materials, such as mercury, lead, or acid. While you are waiting to dispose of your batteries, keep them in a place where they will not be accessible to children or pets who might be harmed by playing with them or swallowing them.If you do suspect that a child or pet has swallowed a battery, contact emergency services immediately.  If your batteries become corroded or overheated, they could leak or rupture. It is also important to avoid storing your batteries near any flammable materials, as this could present a fire hazard., Sometimes seemingly dead batteries still carry a bit of a charge. If the positive and negative terminals of old batteries touch, it can create an electric current, which can lead to a fire. This risk can be minimized by putting a little tape over the terminals of your old batteries until you are ready to dispose of them.Fire can also result from the terminals of batteries coming into contact with conductive materials (like keys, steel wool, or other objects likely to be lying in your rummage drawer).  Storing your batteries in a non-conductive container will reduce the risk of fire, leakage, or rupture.If you still have the original packaging for your batteries, this is a relatively safe way to store old batteries for disposal. Consider individually bagging especially hazardous batteries, like 9 volt alkaline batteries, button batteries, lead acid batteries, or lithium batteries.  Mixing batteries with different chemistries may result in leakage and hazardous chemical reactions. If you have multiple types of batteries to dispose of, bag them separately. 

store your dead batteries away from children and pets.  keep your batteries in a cool, dry place.  tape the terminals of your batteries.  store used batteries in a cardboard or plastic container.  do not store different types of batteries together. 

 You'll need the following:  2-3 cups of boiled chicken breast, coarsely chopped 2 stalks celery, chopped 1/2 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped 4-6 green olives, pitted and minced 1/4 cup chopped red onion 1/2 apple, cored and chopped 1/3 head iceberg lettuce, chopped 5 tablespoons mayonnaise 1 tablespoon sweet berry preserves 2 teaspoons fresh squeezed lemon juice Salt and pepper  , Bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil, and then place the chicken breasts inside. Reduce to a simmer, cover the pot, and allow the breasts cook for 15-20 minutes.  Once the breasts have cooled, chop them into small pieces.  Set aside.  Add salt and pepper to taste, and then drizzle the dressing over the salad. , 

prepare your ingredients.  boil the chicken.  strain the water from the pot and transfer the chicken to a cutting board.  combine the chicken, vegetables, and chopped apple in a large bowl.  mix together the mayonnaise, lemon juice, and berry preserves in a separate bowl.  toss the salad and dressing together.  ,  serve at room temperature or refrigerate for 3-5 hours before serving.  

 Before you ever get in the car, review the rules of the road, the basics of automobile operation and maintenance, and the requirements for getting a driver's license.   Review both the drivers' handbook and the owner's manual for the car. If your student driver is also your child, this is a good time to agree on what responsibilities you will have and what responsibilities are your child's. Who will pay for fuel and insurance? Will your child drive your car or get his/her own? Must he/she be home at a certain hour or maintain certain grades in school? It is a good idea to lay out these conditions in advance.; , Encourage the one you're teaching to notice what you do. You can start this process well before your student will get his/her license.   Drive out loud. It may have been a long time since you were conscious of your driving, but try to narrate the process aloud with your learner as a passenger. Say things like, "That blue car is going too fast. It'll probably pull in front of us, so I'll leave extra space," and "I'm going to turn left up ahead, so I'll signal and start pulling over and slowing down now."  Demonstrate good driving technique and adhere to the rules even more than usual. Leave space, signal, do not speed, and avoid berating other drivers. Encourage your passenger to make judgments about what traffic will do and how to respond to it. Discuss road hazards and what to do about them.  In many cases, they may not practice on public roads without it.  Review what the rules are for using the learner's permit. In most cases, an adult or teacher will need to be in the car with the student. Keep a log of driving practice hours if one is required as part of the license process.  An empty parking lot after hours is a one choice.   Go out the first few times in daylight and in mild weather. Let your student learn at least the basics of controlling the car and maneuvering in traffic before driving under hazardous or difficult conditions.    Turn the car on and off a few times. Fasten your seat belts, adjust the mirrors and seats, release the brake, start the ignition, put the car in gear, etc. Then, reverse the process. Review the controls for windshield wipers, headlights, turn signals and other items.    Accelerate and decelerate so that it is smooth and even. Practice changing gears if it is a manual transmission car. Drive in patterns, especially those that will be required in real driving situations. Make left and right turns. Try parallel parking next to a curb or painted line. Try parking in the marked spaces. Get comfortable with where the sides and back of the car are. Practice backing the car, too. Again, start with an open space, then try backing up towards a target, preferably one that won't damage the car in case of error (such as a hedge or painted lines). Practice multiple times in the parking lot, if that is what it takes to be confident and consistent with basic controls and positioning.    Practice staying on the correct side and centered in the lane. Advise stopping well back of other cars at stop lights. A good rule of thumb is being able to see the wheels of the car in front. Especially with an inexperienced driver, stopping too soon is far Remind your student to leave plenty of space for stopping. ,, Generally, the driver's manual will indicate the sorts of maneuvers that will be tested, so find some side streets and practice those items. You may not be able to give your student a particular score, but you can probably give some feedback, such as "watch your speed" or "you forgot to signal that turn."  

start at home.  model good driving.  help your student driver to get his or her learner's permit or provisional license.  find a place off the street and relatively free of obstructions for your student's first experience behind the wheel.  review the controls.  practice controlling the car.  choose a road with light traffic for the first on-road experience.  work up gradually to more involved driving situations, such as freeways, inclement weather, and heavy traffic.  ,  practice maneuvers that will be needed on the driver's test as well as techniques that will be needed for driving under real conditions.  ,  rehearse for the driving test, even if you have to make it up yourselves.

 Never allow two cats to interact face to face right away. Cats are territorial by nature. Your current cat will not react well if you simply introduce a new cat into its territory. Begin the introduction process with a period of confinement.Choose a small room to keep the new cat. Make sure the cat has all the essential, such as food, a litter box, a scratching post, and so on. At first, keep the new cat's food, water, and other things away from the door. Interacting through the door can help the cats get used to each other, but you should not encourage too much interaction right away.; , Cats learn to recognize other animals through scents and pheromones. In order to ease both cats into knowing a new animal, swap toys and bedding. The transition will go smoother if each cat is used to the other cat's scent.For best results, go for items you've seen each cat rubbing up against or nuzzling.  After a few days, you can begin allowing the cats to interact through the doors. Play with each cat near the door. Move bedding, toys, food, and water closer to the door.The cats may be standoffish and nervous at first, but be persistent. You want the cat to gradually get used to the other animal. You may see your cats pawing at one another through the door. As long as there is no hissing, this can be seen as a form of play.  After two to three days of interaction through the doors, switch the cats between confinement areas.Let the new cat explore the house while the old cats are placed in the confinement area. This will get your new cat used to its new home and allow the other cats to get used to the new cat's scent.Switch out the cats several times a day for a few days. Make sure you only let the new cat roam around the house when you are home to supervise.  

begin with a confinement period.  trade items between the cats.  encourage the cats to interact through the door.  switch out the cats. 

 Before you approach your colleague with negative feedback, think about how to structure the conversation. Preparing an outline can help you clearly deliver your message, which will help the recipient focus on and correct the problem. Having a well-planned, sincere conversation will help enact change and spare the recipients feelings and self-esteem.   Write down a draft of what you would like to say to your friend or employee. This will help you create an effective, thoughtful compliment sandwich.; , Be mindful of your posture when you approach an employee. If you are feeling nervous, remind yourself to strand straight and lean toward the person when you are speaking to them. When in an uncomfortable situation, you may be more likely to physically close off from those around you.Remember to smile, keep your arms at your sides, and avoid crossing your arms and feet.  Create a comfortable and open conversation by maintaining a calm, steady voice. Relax your shoulders and take deep breathes to create a calm and positive demeanor. Remember to smile throughout the conversation. Studies have shown that smiling also helps reduce anxiety, blood pressure, and your heart rate, which will put you at ease during the critique as well as the recipient.Start the conversation with a friendly greeting and an invitation to sit down. "Hi Derek, please come in and have a seat. How was your weekend?" Speaking in a calm, relaxed tone will help put the employee at ease and will help set up a positive interaction.  Before delving into a critique, open with a sincere compliment or praise. Beginning with the criticism can create a combative, aggressive situation, and the recipient may be less likely to fully understand your message.Opening with positive feedback helps create a friendly tone that will help set both you and the recipient at ease.   After greeting the employee, give them some positive feedback. "Your manager and I reviewed your finance reports. They are very strong, and you are doing an excellent job."  , Provide the recipient with a thoughtful, genuine compliment that is unique to them. The key to giving a sincere compliment is to be truthful. Do not create a generic compliment that does not apply to your employee, otherwise it may appear contrived and out of place. Providing a sincere, truthful compliment can help build a positive relationship.In addition, showing the recipient that you notice their individual efforts and contributions will make them more likely to react positively.   Use examples of their successful completion of a recent project or task. “You did a great job preparing the agenda for yesterday’s meeting, Jane. I know the material was difficult to organize, and you did a fantastic job. Thanks a lot for your help!” Highlight the person’s skills or positive attributes when praising them. “Your friendliness and eagerness to help has made the volunteer program a huge success. Thanks for greeting everyone with a smile each morning! I know it makes their day.”  , If you can link the compliment or praise to the criticism, it can make your transition into the critique easier. It will also help create a cohesive, streamlined conversation.   Perhaps your employee is always on time, but it takes them a while to settle in and begin to do their work. “Hi Tom, thanks so much for clocking in on time each day. I know traffic can be really congested at that time, so I appreciate all your efforts to get here. I have noticed that you hang out in the break room afterward for long periods of time before you go to your desk.” When possible, linking the opening compliment to the critique can help drive your message home.  After opening the conversation on a friendly, positive note, follow-up with a discussion about the problem at hand. Avoid having the conversation in a public place or in the presence of other employees. Address only one or two issues. Do not use this time to list several pieces of negative feedback.Select the most pressing issues and focus on those so that you do not overwhelm the recipient.  When moving from the compliment to the critique, use transition words to create a more powerful message. Use words like “however,” “regrettably”, or “unfortunately” to indicate a contrast between the two sections.A transition word can help pivot the conversation and ease it into the critique. “I am really thankful that you have offered to help out in the mentoring program. However, some mentees have indicated that you are not responsive to meeting requests. It is important to make time for your mentees to help them along with their projects.”  , Although you are trying to maintain a positive atmosphere and lessen the blow to the employee, you should still be straightforward when discussing the problem. The employee should be aware of the problem and its effects to fully understand why this behavior needs to be corrected going forward.   Be clear and concise when offering the critique. “I was reviewing your expense report from your last business trip to Chicago. I did not approve the after-dinner drinks you shared with our client since our expense policy does not cover alcohol purchases. Please keep that in mind next month when you travel to San Diego.” Be honest about the effects that the problem has created. “Because you did not check to see if the projector was working in the conference room, the committee was not able to start the meeting on time. We’ve had to push back out budget due date because of this.”  , Once you have addressed the problem, it is important to end the conversation with a compliment. This will help build the recipient’s self-esteem and will encourage them to make the suggested changes going forward. This last compliment will help sandwich the negative feedback, making the overall conversation positive and effective.   Wrap up the conversation with encouragement about any upcoming project. “I saw your draft for next month’s presentation. It looks fantastic! The topic is really interesting and relevant to our department. I’m really looking forward to it!” This will help build your employee’s confidence, which will help them strive to do great work. Remind the employee that this problem is not detrimental to their progress at the company, if applicable. “I’m really looking forward to discussing your growth in the company. I think you would be a great addition to the Education Committee. Let’s discuss this option at the end of the quarter.”  , Be sure to check in a few days later. Ask if they have any questions or concerns or if they have resolved the issue. Let them know that you are available for a meeting to discuss possible solutions., If you frequently use the compliment sandwich to offer feedback or criticism, the recipient will notice and may perceive your compliments as disingenuous and insincere.In addition, the recipient may expect to hear criticism each time you pay them a compliment or offer praise.This may make your future attempts to provide feedback ineffective.  Sandwiching a major problem between two compliments could mask the severity of the negative feedback.Be sure that you are not downplaying the problem and focusing too much on the compliments and praise. This can weaken the recipient’s understanding that there needs to be improvement  , If you have discussed a reoccurring issue or if the employee’s behavior is cause for serious concern, avoid using the compliment sandwich. It may cause the recipient to think that the problem is not that pressing, important, or crucial. Address unsafe, unhealthy, destructive, or recurrent issues in private with the employee. 

prepare your message.  use positive body language.  speak in a calm voice.  open with positive feedback.  be sincere.  tie in a compliment that is related to the criticism.  follow-up with the critique.  use transition words.  be honest.  end the conversation with praise.  follow-up with the person.  use the compliment sandwich sparingly.  avoid lessening the problem.  be direct with your employee about serious matters. 

 Dozens of Native American tribes and other cultures have their own smudging ceremonies, and each one has its own traditions concerning which plants to use. Sage is probably the most common choice, and is especially important for the Cheyenne and other Great Plains cultures. While many cultures consider white sage to be excellent at driving away bad spirits or energies, other varieties are commonly used as well.; , Cedar is another plant often burned in cleansing ceremonies, especially in the Pacific Northwest or Canada. Note that some trees referred to as "cedars" are actually juniper trees, which some tribes use in smudging and some do not.While many people now mix multiple herbs together, the practice is not supported by some Native American elders.Again, there are many different smudging ceremonies, and some of them may call for sweetgrass or a different plant instead of sage or cedar. Follow this advice to perform an effective and respectful ceremony if you have not been taught a specific culture's tradition.  Sweetgrass, or holy grass, is a sacred plant across North America, and is often considered to represent kindness and please spirits.It is sometimes burned after the sage or cedar have cleared away negative energy.   If you have been taught a specific tribe's tradition that uses sweetgrass in the main ceremony, feel free to use it, or any other plant that tribe allows.  While tobacco can be added to the smudging ceremony, stick to one herb if this is your first time smudging. Instead, use tobacco as an offering before you harvest a different herb.See below for more information.  If you can, harvest these plants yourself as described in the sub-steps, preferably in as natural an environment as possible. Otherwise, obtain them from a Native American shop in person or online, to ensure the plants were treated appropriately.   Before picking the plant, many tribes thank the Creator or nature, then place or burn natural, raw tobacco as an offering. Harvest the correct part of the cedar tree. Pick branches at eye level with green tips. Dry them and crush them into a rough powder before burning.You should not harvest sweetgrass yourself, as it is endangered in some areas.Sweetgrass is usually dried and braided before use, so try to find sustainably harvested sweetgrass braids from a Native American shop or online store., Clay or stone bowls are commonly used in smudging rituals. Abalone shells are another common container, but be aware that some Pacific Northwest tribes believe they are not appropriate for this ritual.   Bundles of herbs, called "smudge sticks", can be made yourself or purchased pre-bundled. Some Native American elders question how traditional smudge sticks are, but they are now used even by many Native Americans., Many people use a feather or fan of feathers to waft the smoke during a smudging ceremony. In the US, eagle and hawk feathers are illegal to possess unless you belong to certain native tribes.Turkey feathers are legal, and traditionally used by some tribes in eastern North America. Do not use owl feathers, as these have different ritual purposes.It is illegal to buy wild feathers in the United States.Purchase cruelty-free feathers from farm-raised birds, or use feathers you've obtained yourself from hunting or finding them in the wild.  Keep your plants and smudging container on a space cleared for them, above the ground. A high bookshelf cleared for their use is a good choice. Do not use the herbs until they are dry, or you will fail to produce the right kind of smoke.  Many people smudge when they move into a new place or stay in a hotel room, to purify the new space. You may wish to perform a smudging ceremony after you hear bad news, or when you are preparing for a big change in your life.Smudging could also help you deal with the aftereffects of a big argument or a long illness.   Smudging is performed more frequently under certain circumstances, such as in places where other ceremonies take place, or sometimes during archaeological excavations of native remains and sacred materials. Smudging a dorm room may be against university policy against fire use, although some U.S. institutions have changed these policies after challenges based on the First Amendment and freedom of religion.  

use sage if you are not following a specific tradition.  consider cedar instead if it grows in your area.  only burn sweetgrass after the smudging ceremony is done.  buy raw, natural tobacco if you want to harvest the plants yourself.  obtain these plants from respectful sources.  choose a natural container to hold it in, or bundle the herb into a bunch.  waft the smoke with a turkey feather (optional).  store the materials above waist height and let them dry.  know when to smudge.

 Try to remove as much of the urine as possible. This will ultimately make your job easier. Use clean paper towels and apply pressure. Repeat with new paper towels until you are unable to soak up any more urine.Skip this step if the urine has already dried. You can also use old throw away towels instead of paper ones. The thickness of regular towels allows for better absorption, soaking up more cat urine. If available, use a white towel. Once there's no longer a yellow-tint to the liquid being absorbed, you'll know all the urine has been absorbed.; , Enzymatic cleaners, like Nature's Miracle, contain special biological enzymes that break down the proteins in urine, reducing or even completely eliminating the smell.Note that some enzymatic cleaners may not work if other chemicals were used beforehand to try to treat the stain. It is generally a good idea to try the enzymatic cleaner first, and saturate the area well. Follow the manufacturer’s directions closely and allow to dry for several days. You may not have to do anything else.  If an enzyme cleaner didn't completely remove the smell, use a vinegar solution. Combine equal parts of white vinegar and water in a bowl or spray bottle. Saturate or spray the soiled area. Saturate a little bit beyond the soiled area so you can be sure to remove all urine.   If you have a black light or UV light at your disposal, you can see the urine glow in the dark and find the exact location of the urine spot.  Use a bristle brush and thoroughly rub the vinegar/water mixture until the area is completely soaked. The vinegar will neutralize the ammonia smell in your cat's urine., Again, use paper towels or a clean rag to blot up as much vinegar solution as possible. Let the area air dry completely after you've blotted it.  Wash the soiled area with a household cleaner that does not contain ammonia. Ammonia smells like urine to dogs and cats. Wipe the area clean with water. In a spray bottle, mix 10 parts water to 1 part bleach. Put on rubber gloves and spray the soiled area. Let the bleach sit for 30 seconds, then clean the soiled area with a damp cloth.   Be careful with the bleach as it may damage and change the color of some materials.  If any clothing has urine, add 1 cup (60 ml) of apple cider vinegar to the laundry detergent in your regular wash. If you still smell urine, add some enzymatic cleaner to your wash.Dry cleaning may be necessary. If you can't get the smell or stain out of an item, you may just have to throw it out.  Baking soda, also known as sodium bicarbonate, is a natural cleaner as well as an odor-absorber and deodorant.  Mix 1/2 cup of 3% hydrogen peroxide with one teaspoon (5 ml) of dish detergent and spread it over the baking soda.You may want to spot test this cleaning solution on an inconspicuous area at first to confirm that there is no discoloration.  Wear rubber gloves if possible, and wait for the telltale foaming action of the baking soda and hydrogen peroxide to kick in. , Vacuuming the soiled area removes both the urine particles and the deodorizer you applied. Extracting wet vacs work the best for this since they saturate the carpet and then vacuum the water back into the vacuum's tank.In a pinch, you can use your regular vacuum; it just won't be as effective as the wet vac.   For best results with a wet vac, use cool water in the vacuum tank and always follow the manufacturer's instructions. Avoid using steam cleaners, since the high heat will actually set the stain., Never yell or punish your cat for urinating in the wrong area. Instead, quickly move her to the litter box. Consistently take her to the litter box and give positive feedback when she uses it. This will reinforce a positive association with urinating and her litter box.  Cats like clean litter boxes, just as humans like clean bathrooms. If you're neglecting your cat's needs when it comes to offering a clean litter box, he may find it harder to resist urinating on your sofa or carpet.   Keep your cat's litter box in a quiet location that is not near its feeding area. This will increase the chance that the box will be used properly.  Cats that are spayed will not purposely urinate in order to mark their territory, solving the problem for you in the first place. Plus, you won't end up with a litter of kittens to potty train!  , While accidents do happen, particularly with young or even elderly animals, there may be a medical issue at the heart of the problem if you notice your pet urinating inappropriately. Contact your veterinarian to discuss possible medical reasons that your cat is urinating outside of the litter box. Ignoring a medical issue, such as a urinary tract infection, kidney disease or diabetes, could be life threatening for your pet.  

blot the urine on your carpet with paper towels.  use an enzymatic cleaner.  mix up a vinegar solution.  scrub the vinegar solution into the soiled area.  dry the area thoroughly.  disinfect hard surfaces.  check clothing for urine.  sprinkle baking soda over the area.  mix a small amount of hydrogen peroxide and mild dish detergent together.  use a scrub brush to rub the solution into to the baking soda.  blot the area and allow the mixture to dry.  ,  vacuum the soiled area.  re-train your cat.  replace the cat's litter box more often.  consider getting your cat neutered or spayed.  have your cat checked by the veterinarian.

 Slowly but surely, any rubber object, be it your car windshield wiper blades or the elastic waistband of your favorite pajama pants, will harden over time. Evidence of white or colored substances on the rubber can be one indication of a chemical reaction taking place.   Natural rubber has poor resistance to both ozone and UV light, as well as to petroleum oils. Additionally, temperatures below -60 degrees or above 220 degrees (Fahrenheit) will degrade it quickly, while temperature extremes in general will facilitate degradation and hardening.Rubber stretches and flexes because it is made up of long, tangled molecule chains that can be straightened out under tension. Degradation of these molecular chains can occur from repeated or excessive tension (think of frayed or over-stretched rubber bands), or by exposure to elements like those noted above.; , Cracked rubber will remain cracked even when it’s softened. Once cracks form, your only options will be to try out a rubber patch kit or to simply replace the rubber object. There is no miracle cure by this point.   One point worth making here is that common softening methods — heat and oils — actually damage the rubber in the process. So, every time you do soften up a stiff rubber gasket or shoe sole, you are also contributing to its eventual demise., There is only so much you can do to keep oxygen, temperature fluctuations, and light away from rubber, but wiping away residue can help keep deteriorating oils from damaging the object.   Clean rubber objects with only warm water and a clean cloth when possible. If necessary, use a mild detergent and rinse it away completely. Solvents found in cleaners can degrade or even dissolve rubber., If possible, remove as much air (and thus oxygen) from the container as you can before sealing it.   Placing rubber items in zip close bags and using a straw to suck out most of the air can noticeably delay the hardening process. If you’ve ever compared rubber bands kept in a plastic bag in your junk drawer from those loose in the drawer, you know the difference it can make.Natural rubber is especially susceptible to oxidization because sulfur is added to the mix when making items like rubber bands. Oxygen reacts with sulfur and essentially removes it from the item, leaving it more brittle.  The same place you might store apples or potatoes would actually make a decent place to also keep your bagged-up sneakers.   68 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit (20 to 25 degrees Celsius) is a sensible temperature range for storing rubber items, though lower temperatures can also be good.You might even consider keeping tightly sealed rubber items in your refrigerator. The excessive cold and higher humidity of the freezer, however, makes it a less ideal choice.  

check rubber objects regularly for hardening.  examine the rubber for signs of damage.  keep rubber objects clean.  seal rubber in an airtight container to delay hardening.  place the container in a cool, dry, dark place. 

 You might already know about a girl scout troop at your school or a community center. Maybe you even have friends in one! If you can't find a troop, contact the local Girl Scout Council in your area. They should be able to help direct you to any troops within your city, or even a city or two over. You can find your local council on the Girl Scouts website: https://www.girlscouts.org/en/about-girl-scouts/join/council-finder.html   If your council can't help you, try calling the national line at 1-800-478-7248. If neither of these works, you may be able to search the Craigslist for your area under Community.; , This is a good way to get an idea of how often the troops in your area meet and what they do together. For example, some troops may be more focused on outdoor activities like camping, while other troops are all about arts and crafts. Though every troop should be involved in a mix of everything, the interests of the girls in the troops are likely to determine most of the activities.   Talking to your friends is also a great way to find out how fun it can be in a troop. If you don’t have any friends in Girl Scouts, try asking around with other classmates. Chances are there are one or two girls in your grade that are involved.  If you still feel unsure about whether or not you want to join after talking to people, going to a meeting is a great way to get an idea of what being in a troop would be like. Ask your friends if you can tag along with them - if it’s okay with their troop leader, of course. You can also search the Girl Scouts website for troops in your area and contact a troop leader that way.   When contacting a troop leader, simply say “Hi, my name is Jane Doe and I’m interested in joining a Girl Scout troop. I was wondering if I would be able to sit-in on one of your troop meetings?” Remember every troop is different, so if you have a bad experience sitting in on one troop, don’t get discouraged! Instead, try joining up with a different troop for a meeting and go from there.  Most Girl Scout troops meet once a week or once a month, and in between these meetings they also do other activities like selling cookies, earning badges, and camping. Though earning badges is an activity you can also do on your own, making sure you have time for regular meetings and other extracurriculars with your troop is important., Though you can join Girl Scouts at any age, even as an adult, most Girl Scouts are between 5 and 18 years old. Depending on your age, you will be assigned a specific level. Currently, there are 5 main levels in Girl Scouts - Daisy, Brownie, Junior, Cadette, and Senior. However, recently there was a 6th level added called Ambassadors.Moving up in level is usually based on grade. For example, girls in Kindergarten and 1st grade are Daisies, while girls in 2nd and 3rd grade might be Brownies. Each level does the same sorts of activities, however, it usually isn’t until they are Juniors that Girl Scouts begin to go camping.  There are a couple of different ways to join a troop. For example, some schools have a Girl Scout troop directly affiliated with them. These are often run by a parent whose child is in the school. If there isn’t a troop connected to your school, you can contact the Girl Scout Council in your area to find all the currently operating troops.   To contact the Girl Scout Council, simply go online to the Girl Scout website, click Join Now, enter your zip code, and voila! They should direct you to your local council who will help you find a troop., Once you’ve found a troop you will have to pay the annual fee to join. This should only be $25 for girls and adults alike. However, there are additional costs for activities like camping, going to museums, and purchasing sashes, vests, or tunics - which are part of the uniform.If you are worried about affording the annual fees or extra costs, you can ask your troop leader about SHARE, an official Girl Scout organization that helps to cover these costs., The last step in becoming a Girl Scout is taking the Girl Scout pledge and accepting the Girl Scout law. The Girl Scout pledge states, “On my honor, I will try: to serve God and my country, to help people at all times, and to live by the Girl Scout law.” When saying this, you should also hold up three fingers on your left hand in the Girl Scout salute., Most people know Girl Scouts because of their cookies, which are sold by troops seasonally. The money from these cookies helps fund activities and events for every troop. Every troop has a different date and time for cookie sales, which depends on their location. The purpose of selling cookies, however, is for more than just profits. As a Girl Scout participating in cookie sales you will learn goal setting, decision making, money management, people skills, and business ethics., You can do this with your troop or on your own. The purpose of earning badges is to follow your interests and learn new things. For example, if you’re into inventing new things, cooking, or painting, there’s a badge for you. You can find a book of the different types of badges online for every level of Girl Scouts. You can even choose your own activity, find a teacher, and design your own badge for it. To earn a badge, simply decide on an activity you'd like to pursue, then look at the badge book for your level (i.e. Daisy, Brownie, or Junior) and find one that fits your interests. The book will then tell you what steps to follow to complete the requirements to earn your badge.For example, as a Cadette you can earn a Night Owl badge which requires you to explore the outdoors after hours. To earn this badge you have to meet people who work at night and hold a nighttime party. Then, upon proof of completion, you can add this badge to your sash or vest.  Outside of spending weekly or monthly meetings with your troop, going camping is a great way to make new friends and experience new things. Even if you aren’t going with your troop, you can attend a Girl Scout camp all on your own. At camp, you’ll go on nature walks, play games, make arts and crafts, and learn useful skills like how to build a campfire, fish, pitch a tent, go horseback riding, and even go canoeing.   There are different kinds of camps as well, for example, day camps, weekend camps, and weekly camps.  

locate a troop.  talk to your friends who are already in girl scouts.  visit a meeting.  find a way to make it to the meetings.  figure out your age group.  join a troop.  pay the annual fee and additional costs.  take the pledge.  sell cookies.  get badges.  go camping. 

 Glucose gives the body energy. If your puppy is hypoglycemic, you'll first notice it moving more slowly and becoming restless. As the hypoglycemia worsens and your puppy’s brain is starved for glucose, your puppy will tremble, have a blank stare, and fall on its side.Other signs of hypoglycemia include:Wobbly walking Shivering Head tilt; , As soon as you notice your young puppy looking restless, try feeding it some food.Eating a little bit of food may be enough to raise your puppy’s blood glucose back to normal levels.If your puppy does not want to eat, then you will need to feed it some sugar.   If your young puppy is still nursing, you may need to bottle feed it.  A small dose of sugar will help to quickly raise your puppy’s blood glucose levels. Rather than giving your puppy sugar crystals, give it a liquid sugar source:Nutri-Cal® (available at your local pet store) Maple syrup Karo syrup Molasses  , Give your puppy the sugar source by either rubbing a small amount on the gums with your finger or placing a few drops under your puppy’s tongue.Placing the sugar source on the gums or under the tongue will help it be absorbed more quickly by the body.One to two tablespoons of a sugar source is usually enough to revive a small dog with hypoglycemia.If your young puppy is really tiny, ask your vet about how much you should give. You can also place a few drops of the sugar source on your puppy’s tongue.If you’re going to give drops of the sugar source, use a medicine dropper. To prevent your puppy from choking, do not put the sugar source directly down its throat., In many instances of puppy hypoglycemia, just a small amount of sugar will be enough to revive the puppy.If the hypoglycemia is not severe, your puppy should perk back up in one to two minutes.If your puppy does not respond, contact your vet immediately.   Be aware that the sugar source is just a quick fix. Your puppy’s blood glucose levels may drop again, causing another episode of hypoglycemia.If your puppy becomes hypoglycemic again, give it more of the sugar source and contact your vet.  If you needed to give your puppy a sugar source to handle its hypoglycemia, feed it a small amount of high-quality canned puppy food once it perks up.The food will give your puppy more glucose and help it recover.   If your puppy refuses the canned food, try feeding it some tasty treats., Even if your puppy looks fine after getting a little bit of sugar, your vet should still examine your puppy to determine if a health problem has caused the hypoglycemia. If your puppy did not respond at all to the sugar, then a vet visit is essential to get your puppy the intensive care it will need to recover.   Your puppy will also need to see your vet if it responded to the sugar, but became hypoglycemic again., Your vet will need to confirm that your young puppy has hypoglycemia. They will first perform a physical exam of your puppy. Then, they will take a small blood sample to measure your puppy’s blood glucose levels.Intestinal parasites can rob your young puppy’s body of important nutrients like glucose. Your vet may also perform a fecal exam to look for intestinal parasites., If your puppy has severe hypoglycemia, it will need immediate and intensive treatment by your vet. To administer this treatment, your vet will need to hospitalize your puppy for at least one day. Examples of intensive treatment for young puppies with hypoglycemia are:Intravenous dextrose (a type of sugar) Deworming (kills intestinal parasites) Heat therapy Fluids  , A young puppy’s body cannot regulate its blood glucose levels very well. Feeding your young puppy multiple times a day, at the same times each day, can help prevent hypoglycemia.Puppies should eat three to four times a day.Leave the food out for 10 to 20 minutes. This will help prevent your puppy from becoming a picky eater—it will learn that it should eat right away, rather than pick at the food for a long time., A healthy puppy diet, when fed multiple times a day, will help keep your young puppy’s blood glucose levels from dropping too low. Also, high-quality puppy food will give your puppy the nutrients it needs to grow into a healthy adult dog.Many types of puppy diets are available. If you are unsure which one is right for your puppy, talk with your breeder or vet for guidance. Puppies have specific nutritional needs. Do not feed your puppy an adult dog diet. Canned foods tend to be tastier than dry foods.Your puppy may prefer canned food. Realize that the feeding guidelines on the food label may not work for your young puppy. Talk with your vet to determine how much you should feed your puppy at each meal.  A puppy should gain a little bit of weight every day. Daily weight gain means it’s eating enough food and getting enough nutrients, including glucose. Try weighing your puppy using a gram scale, which you can purchase a kitchen supply store. Record the weight on a piece of paper.If your young puppy is too big or wiggly for a gram scale, try this: Weigh yourself on a regular scale, then hold your puppy in your arms. To get your puppy’s weight, subtract your weight from the weight of you and your puppy. If your puppy is not gaining weight, or is losing weight, it could be sick. Take your puppy to your vet.  A cold puppy will use up extra glucose to stay warm, causing a condition called juvenile hypoglycemia. To prevent this type of hypoglycemia, wrap your young puppy in extra blankets to keep it warm. Also, keep your home at a warm temperature., Stress can cause a young puppy to become hypoglycemic. Examples of stressful events are vaccinations (or vet visits in general), over-handling, illness, and changes in a puppy’s environment.Minimizing your puppy’s stress can help prevent hypoglycemia.   Give your puppy treats when it behaves well at the vet’s office. That way, it may not get so stressed when it’s there. Do not try to handle your puppy all the time. Give it some alone time so it can rest. Keep your puppy’s routine the same from day to day.  

recognize hypoglycemia.  feed your puppy.  select a sugar source.  administer the sugar source.  wait for your puppy to perk up.  give your puppy a small meal.  take your puppy to your vet.  have your vet diagnose the hypoglycemia.  allow your vet to treat the hypoglycemia.  maintain a regular feeding schedule.  feed your puppy a high-quality puppy diet.  weigh your puppy each day.  keep your puppy warm.  reduce your puppy’s stress. 

 These microphones are available at electronic and phone stores. Their great advantage over other physical methods is their small size and low profile.  Install it into your receiving ear so that it will pick up the sounds from the speaker when you answer your phone.  Plug the audio jack of the microphone into a portable recording device.   Pocket-sized digital and optical media recorders are widely available for purchase at electronics stores and online.  Switch your portable device's recording on as soon as you get a call. The microphone is always on and will send the sounds it picks up to your recording device.  

use an in-ear microphone.  wear the microphone.  plug in the microphone.  record your call. 

 The holes must fit your fingers in such a way that you can hold the ball without having to squeeze and you can let go without your fingers getting stuck. Because you will be imparting rotation on the ball in the final split seconds that your hand is in contact with it, the importance of grip cannot be overstated.   With the ball resting in the palm of your dominant hand, put your middle and ring finger all the way into the two holes that are side-by-side, and your thumb in the hole under them. The holes should be the size of the fingers and thumb, and you should be able to hold the ball easily in the palm of your hand. There shouldn't be tension in the web of your thumb, nor should it be slack.It should take very little pressure to hold the ball in your hand. If you could break an egg with that amount of pressure, it's too much.; , The characteristics of the core or interior weight block of the bowling ball play an important part in the ball's performance. While there are a number of different core alignments, there are two basic categories into which all balls fit. Determine which type you are using before you get started.Look over your bowling ball and see if it has just one "pin"--the spot on the exterior, usually of a different color, indicating the orientation of the core--or a single normal pin plus a second PSA indicator/mass bias pin. If there is only one pin, the ball should have a symmetric weight block. If you bisected the ball along the axis of the pin, you would discover that both sides are symmetric. This type of ball may be easier for a beginner to handle. A ball with an asymmetric weight block should possess two pins or a pin and an indicator. Just as the name indicates, these balls do not contain symmetric cores, and can contain any shape from that of a cube to something resembling the letter "L." It may prove slightly more difficult for a beginner to attain consistent performance with these bowling balls, but practice with a single ball can certainly change that.  There are two separate guidelines used to suggest the size of ball that should be used. One rule of thumb focuses on the sex of the bowler, and suggests that adult women should use a 10-14 pound ball, while adult men use a 14-16 pound ball.The alternate guideline states that a bowler should use a ball roughly 10% of their body weight, up to the 16 pound maximum size of the ball for those over 160 pounds in weight.It is important to use a ball of the appropriate weight in order to impart the necessary amount of spin. A strong individual using a smallish ball could easily impart too much torque and put the ball in the gutter. A weaker individual using too heavy a ball could struggle to impart enough spin in order to make the ball hook. The weight of the ball should be clearly marked on it.  The pocket is the space between two pins that you want to target with the ball. If you're right-handed, the pocket is the space between the number 1 pin (the foremost pin) and the number 3 pin (the pin just behind and to the right of number 1). If you're left-handed, your pocket is between the number 1 and number 2 pin (the pin just behind and to the left of number 1).  The style of grip that you use can determine the intensity of the ball's hook--in other words, at what angle the ball enters the pocket. Remember that the greater the angle, the better your scoring potential.   A "relaxed" grip is more likely to produce a straighter roll, and thus a minimal hook. In this grip, the hand is flexed back at the wrist, so that as you pass into the forward swing it is on top of the ball. For a "strong" grip, the hand bends forward, as if to cradle the ball between your palm and inner wrist. If seen from the side, the angle from your forearm to your thumb should appear to be 90 degrees. This grip can provide a greater amount of spin, and from that a greater hook. A "firm" grip is an intermediate form that results in a moderate hook. In this grip the wrist neither bends nor flexes, creating a continuous line from your forearm through your hand., As you face the lane, imagine its boards grouped into three sections: outside left (towards the left gutter), middle, and outside right (towards the right gutter). Keeping in mind the strength of your grip and the anticipated amount of hook it will produce, decide which board(s) your sliding forward foot should align with.   Relaxed grip: The ball should travel straight down the lane into the pocket, so if you're right-handed, your stance should be in the outside right, and lefties in the outside left. Firm grip: Your stance should be in the middle, so the ball curves moderately (either left or right) and enters your target pocket. Strong grip: You want to allow plenty of room for the ball's hook to curve around and enter the pocket. If you're right-handed, you should be on the outside left side; if you're left-handed, you should be on the outside right., One of the standard forms is referred to as the "Four Step Approach." For this approach, begin standing up straight with your feet directly under your body. Hold the ball from underneath with your bowling hand at about mid-chest height (higher for slower bowlers, lower for faster bowlers), and support the ball with your non-bowling hand. As you move through the four steps, keep your bowling arm's elbow as close to your hip as possible, bend your knees slightly, and keep your feet pointed towards the pins. Your shoulders should be squarely facing front. (The following directions are for right-handed bowlers; if you are left-handed, reverse the sides.)   Take one step forward with your right foot and simultaneously bring the ball forward to a position over that foot. Keep your non-bowling hand supporting the ball at this point. Move your left foot forward as you lower the ball close to a knee-level position and then further back behind you, making a half-circle. Your non-bowling hand will have released the ball at this point. Take another step forward with your right leg. At the same time you should be entering the highest point of your backswing with the ball. Bring the ball forward as you take your last step toward the line with your left leg. Your right leg should subtly pass sideways behind your left as you plant your left leg and release the ball. Lower your hips and shift your weight slightly back, bending your torso forward at a 15-degree angle., You will not impart spin by bending or twisting your wrist or arm at this point.Instead, it is through proper delivery and release of the ball that you will impart the spin that results in a "hook."  , Maintain a constant grip as your hand moves into the forward swing, passing the heel of your sliding shoe (the left foot for right-handed bowlers), and then release the ball as it passes the laces. This is the optimum point for momentum to carry the ball onto the lane., The spin comes from your fingers as they release the ball, rather than the wrist. Releasing the thumb first lets the ball roll off the hand, which is where it gets the torque it needs for spin., A small, 15-degree rotation (counterclockwise for right-handed bowlers and clockwise for left-handed) helps add spin.Imagine positioning your hand as if coming into a handshake.  Continue to move your arm upward and forward toward the pocket as you release the ball (and after).  You must first work on consistency. The ability to put all the elements together and repeat them are the keys to success. In the process, think about things like your stance position or the type of grip that you employ.   Also work on your timing with the Four Step Approach: you want to make sure that your foot and the ball arrive at the foul line at the same time. Try recording yourself bowling to get a better sense of how good your timing is.  

find a ball with the right grip for you.  identify the type of ball you are using.  select a ball of the appropriate weight.  determine where the pocket is.  grip the bowling ball.  decide where your stance should be based on the combination of pocket position and grip.  think about your approach before you begin.  keep your arm and wrist straight during the backswing.  release the ball as your arm moves between the laces and toe of your forward-sliding shoe.  make sure your thumb is the first finger out of the ball.  rotate your hand just slightly from the wrist at the moment of release.  follow through with the swing.  adjust based on results. 

 Cut off the bottom "stump" of the vegetable.; ,, Make sure to change the water when it is dirty or turns yellow. Plant the vegetable/plant in soil one day after it has grown roots. The entire base (stump) of the vegetable should be covered by soil, exposing the leaves and base where leaves sprout from.  

take a cabbage, lettuce, or leafy green from the store or your fridge if you have one.  fill a container with cold or cool water (not covering the plant) and place the vegetable in it.  ,  place in a sunny windowsill. 

 Making a mouse sock puppet is easier than it might seem, but you will need some special materials and tools. Gather these items before you begin:two fuzzy socks (you can use one green and one white sock, or use two different colors of your choice!) Styrofoam ball halves (NO3 type) one pompom (red is a good choice, but you can choose the color!) precision knife craft foam in red, green, black, and white scissors hot glue gun marker piece of cardboard; , The parts pattern will give you an actual size diagram that you can use to trace and cut out the parts that you will need to make your mouse sock puppet. Print out the pattern and cut out the parts for the mouth, ears, and tongue so that you can trace them onto the craft foam.You can download the parts pattern at: http://anadiycrafts.com/mouse-sock-puppet/   , Make sure that you give the hot glue gun enough time to warm up before you use it. Otherwise, it will not be as effective. Try switching it on about 15 to 20 minutes before you get started.   Also, when using a hot glue gun, keep the gun tip close to the item that you are gluing. If you hold it too far away, then the glue will dry before it reaches the item., Take the mouth pattern and lay it over your cardboard piece. Then, use your marker to trace the mouth shape onto the cardboard. Next, cut along the marker lines to create your cardboard mouth piece., Lay the sock heel side up on your work surface and position your cardboard mouth piece to see where you will need to glue it. You will need to place it near the toe of the sock and allow a little space around the edges.Once you have decided on the best position for the mouth, apply some hot glue to the back of your cardboard piece and press the cardboard piece onto the sock.  Curl up the sock around the cardboard piece's edges to create a raised border. Apply a line of hot glue to the edges as you go.Make sure that you press the sock into the edges and hold for a second.  After you have finished creating a border around the cardboard piece, take the mouth pattern and lay it over the red craft foam. Use the marker to trace around the edges of the pattern and then cut it out., Lay the red foam mouth piece over the cardboard piece. Then, apply glue to the back of the red foam mouth piece and secure it to the cardboard piece.Make sure that any remaining marker is facing down. Check the position of the red foam mouth piece before you attach it to the cardboard piece.  Use the tongue pattern to trace the tongue piece over the black craft foam. Then, cut out the tongue piece. It should look like a black heart when you are done. Position the tongue piece over the lower portion of the mouth piece.When you have decided where to position your tongue piece, apply glue to the back side of the tongue piece and press it into place.  Your foam ball or ball halves will be the eyes of your puppet. If you just have a foam ball, then you will need to cut it in half. Then, take the two halves of the foam ball and lay them flat side down. Next, use the precision knife to cut off a piece of the foam near the edge.When you are finished, you should have two foam ball halves that have a flat edge on one side. You should be able to place the foam pieces side-by-side and they should fit together.  Cut out two thin strips of black craft foam. Then, use hot glue to attach these strips to the rounded parts of the foam so that they look like the edges of eyelids.Next, cut off a piece of your second fuzzy sock. The piece should be wide enough and long enough to wrap all the way around the foam ball. Glue the sock material over the eyelid area to create the fuzzy eyelids. Cut off any excess sock material from the edges of the eyelids.  Cut out two 1.5 centimeter circles from the black craft foam. Then, cut out a small wedge from each of the circles. Next, glue the circles onto the rounded foam part of the eyes so that the wedges are pointing in the same direction (either to the right or to the left)., Once your eyes are finished, you can glue them to your sock. Glue the eyes onto the fuzzy side of the sock, opposite the puppet’s mouth. The flat sides of the eye pieces should be facing each other. The eyes should also be placed close together so that the fuzzy sock borders are touching., Use a dot of hot glue to glue the pompom to the center of the sock’s toe area. This will be the puppet’s nose. The pompom should be positioned on the opposite of the mouth side and just a little below the eyes., Use the ear pattern and your marker to trace the ears onto the green craft foam. Then, cut out the two ears from the green craft foam. Check the position of the ears and then glue the ears to the sock and to the backs of the eyes.Apply a line of hot glue along the flat edges of each ear and apply a dot of hot glue to the bottom part of each ear as well. Make sure that you press the ears firmly into place.  Cut out six long, thin strips of black craft foam. Then, attach each of the thin strips to the base of the nose using a small dot of hot glue at the base of the nose. After all of the whiskers are attached, trim the whiskers to that they are all about the same length., Cut out two white foam squares for the teeth. Then, apply some hot glue to one side of one of the foam squares and fold it in half. Make sure that the edges are lined up and hold the edges in place for a few seconds. Then, apply hot glue to one side of the foam and fold it in half again in the same way.Repeat this process for the other tooth. Trim the short edges of the teeth so that they are about the same length and so that the edges are even.  Take one of the teeth and apply a line of hot glue to one of the short edges. Then, press the tooth into top part of the puppet’s mouth near the edge of the red foam.Make sure that the tooth is placed on one side of the nose and that there will be room for the other tooth on the other side. Leave a small gap between the teeth as well. Press gently to make sure that the teeth stay in place. When both teeth are attached, trim them down a bit so that they are even with each other.  Your sock puppet is now finished and ready to use! You can use your puppet to play, entertain your friends with it, or make some more puppets and put on a puppet show!  

gather your materials and tools.  download the parts pattern.  warm up your hot glue gun.  trace the mouth pattern onto the cardboard.  glue the cardboard to the sock.  create a raised border around the cardboard piece.  cut out the red foam mouth piece.  glue the red foam mouth piece over the cardboard.  create the tongue piece.  shape the foam for the eyes.  make the eyelids.  add the pupils.  attach the eyes.  give your puppet a nose.  create the ears.  make the whiskers.  shape the teeth.  attach the teeth to the puppet’s mouth.  use your sock puppet. 

 If you want to start off on the right foot, then you and your date have to put your arms in the right place first. For the prom slow dance, the arm movements are much simpler than for the traditional slow dance. The guy just has to put his arms on either side of the girl's waist, and the girl has to wrap her arms around the guy's waist.   Depending on how intimate you want the dance move to be, you should dance about one foot to half a foot (30 - 15 cm) away from your partner. Girls should plan their shoe height in advance. They should wear shoes that wouldn't make them taller than or at eye-level with their date, or they may feel a little awkward during the slow dance.  Face your partner with at least one to two feet between your heads. Don't stand with your toes touching or you'll bump into each other; instead, stand either with your feet alternating or with the girl's feet inside of the guy's. Keep your feet at last 1 to 1.5 feet (0.3 to 0.5 m) apart (30 cm-45 cm) so you can move from side to side without any problems.  Slow dancing is about as easy as it gets. Just keep your arms positioned correctly, maintain a respectable distance from your partner, and sway back and forth, transferring your weight from one foot to the other without lifting your feet. If you want to rotate or move a bit, just move your feet in rhythm with your partner's.   If you're comfortable with this simple dance, you can go for the "step touch," which means to just step to the right with your right foot, and then to follow this foot with your left, tap the ground, and then reverse the motion by stepping to the left with your left foot, letting the right foot follow it, and so on. Just make sure you keep your feet in sync with your partner's.  In "real" slow dancing, the guy takes the lead while the girl follows. In this version, the guy holds one of the girl's hands and leads her into the direction he wants to go; the girl has to follow so they stay on course. But when you're talking about the good old prom slow dance, that's really not necessary. You'll just be moving from side to side.   If the guy wants to lead, just follow his cue and move in the direction he moves; but for the most part, you won't be moving around too much. Just remember to dance to the beat of the music. Not all slow dance songs have the exact same rhythm, so you will have to move a bit faster or slower depending on the beat.  If you and your partner are totally in love, then sure, you can just sway there and look longingly into each other's eyes. But for most of you, slow dancing in silence could get a little boring or awkward, so don't be afraid to talk to your partner, crack a joke, or just make small talk a little bit. You can say you love or hate the song that's playing, compliment your partner on his or her looks or dancing skills, or talk about the couples around you. Do whatever you gotta do to have fun and feel comfortable.  

position your arms correctly.  position your feet correctly.  start moving.  don't worry about assuming traditional roles.  chat a little bit. 

 Some of the most popular programs include Google AdWords, Microsoft AdCenter and Facebook Ads. These are good places to start because they are user friendly programs that do not take very long to set up.  Whether on social media sites or search engine PPC programs, search keywords are the factor that determines who sees your ad. Choose specific, high-value keywords that cater to searchers who want to buy, not simply look.   Consider buying your brand name as a keyword. This is especially important if your website does not appear high on the top of the search results when you look for your company or brand name.  Choose geographic areas and peak times, options that are now being offered by many search engines for sponsored listings. Facebook also lets you narrow down where your ad appears by gender, relationship status and group.   Look into different PPC formats. For example, this type of ad commonly shows up to the top, right or bottom of search listings in link form. However, banner ads that use graphics and headlines have been shown to be more successful, in general, than text-based ads.  PPC ads can be very easy to create on Google and Facebook; however, the headlines, text and images determine whether they comprise an attractive ad for the consumer. Hire a graphic designer to design banner ads and use words like "sale," "discount," or "exclusive" to encourage people to click.  Most PPC ads allow you to bid for the amount you pay per click. Remember that small businesses are likely to be easily outbid by big corporations for popular search terms, so choose your keywords carefully.  

research ppc advertising options.  choose your keywords.  take advantage of other determining factors.  use marketing professionals to design your ad.  determine a good bid for your ad. 

 Measure 2 1/2 cups (350 g) of all-purpose flour into a mixing bowl. Add 2 3/4 teaspoons of baking powder and 1 teaspoon of salt. Whisk the ingredients for about 30 seconds, so the baking powder is evenly distributed., Pour in 1 tablespoon of vegetable, olive, or canola oil and 3/4 cup (180 ml) of water. Stir the pizza dough until it forms into a ball. You may need 1/4 cup (60 ml) more water, if your flour absorbs a lot of the water.Ensure that you add the extra water a tablespoon or two at a time. Avoid adding so much water that the dough becomes sticky.  Sprinkle a little flour on your work surface and scoop the pizza dough onto it. Knead the dough for 3 to 4 minutes, so the dough becomes smooth and elastic.You can knead the dough however you like. The important thing is that the dough is stretched and folded repeatedly. This will develop the gluten in the flour.  You can use a rolling pin to roll the pizza out to any shape you like, or you can place it into your pizza pan and stretch the dough to fit the pan. Keep in mind that the pizza crust will be thick if you make one pizza out of this dough.If you want to make two thin-crust pizzas, just divide the dough in half and roll them until they're as thin as you'd like.  Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F (200 C). Spread the dough with sauce, pesto, or oil. Sprinkle your choice of pizza toppings across the top and bake the pizza for 15 to 25 minutes.If you're making two thin crust pizzas, they may only need 10 to 15 minutes.  

whisk together the dry ingredients.  stir in the oil and water.  knead the dough.  shape the dough.  top and bake the pizza. 

 Open the deployment clasp as you usually would. The exact method you'll need to use will vary depending on the type of deployment clasp you have.   The deployment clasp must be completely opened and expanded to its longest position. You need to be able to see into the side of the clasp. Make sure that you can see a thin metal prong or pin extending from the top piece to the bottom piece. The two metal pieces are connected on the closed interior side by a small hinge. Standard deployment clasps and hidden deployment clasps are pried open, but push button and fold-over push button deployment clasps must be opened using the appropriate button. For more information, please see the Opening and Closing the Deployment Clasp section of this article.; , Look into the side of the branded section of the clasp. You should be able to identify a hinged flap beneath the top logo. Flip down the flap to open this portion of the clasp.   Grab the branded top with one finger and the unmarked back plate beneath it with your thumb or another strong finger. Hold the branded portion steady while pulling the back plate down and away from it. It should click open without additional work. If you are unable to open the flap with your fingers, use a penny or similarly small metal coin. Insert the penny in between the branded top and the unmarked flap. Twist the coin to either side. The pressure should force the flap to drop open., Thread the strap of the watch or bracelet in between the branded metal bar and the newly opened flap.   Hold the metal bar between your thumb and index finger with the back plate flap hanging open and down. Insert the unattached end of the strap through the gap. Continue threading it through until the band has reached your desired length. Note that the watch will look larger now than it will once the deployment clasp is closed again. Keep that in mind while adjusting the length of the strap. The distance around your wrist will need to equal the sum of the length of both strap ends, the face of the watch, and the length of the closed clasp.  Close the back plate flap to set and secure the new length of the band.   Close the flap by pressing it back up toward the branded top bar. As you close the back plate flap, look into the open side of the hinged metal again. Make sure that the prong or pin connecting the flap and the branded metal top is inserted into one of the holes in the strap., Slip the watch over your hand and onto your wrist. Close the deployment clasp as you usually would to keep the watch on.This is the best time to check the fit. The band should be tight enough to stay on your wrist without turning or slipping off your hand, but it should not be tight enough to dig into your skin or cut off any circulation. If you need to make any adjustments, open the watch as usual and take it off your wrist. Follow the same procedure you just completed to open the adjustment flap, then slide more or less of the band through it to tighten or loosen it. Repeat as needed until you achieve the correct fit.  The deployment clasp and band have now been adjusted to fit your wrist. You should not need to repeat these adjustments again, and the watch should be ready to wear.   Each time you want to wear the watch or bracelet, open the deployment clasp and expand the band to its widest position. Slip the band over your hand and onto your wrist, then close the clasp. Note that deployment clasps are designed to preserve the lifespan of leather and similarly fragile bands.  Pinch the lip of the open clasp end beneath your index finger or in between your index finger and thumb.   To determine which end is the open end, look at the deployment clasp from the side. You should be able to see hinges on one side, and the other side should not have any hinges. The side without hinges should also have a slight lip on it when viewed from the top of the clasp. The "open end" of the clasp is the side without hinges.  Pull up on the clasp lip with your index finger until the cover snaps open, lifting up and away in the direction of your pull.This type of deployment clasp is held together with pressure, so you only need to apply force to open it up. Some deployment clasps are stronger than others, so you may need to apply considerable force to open yours. If you cannot lift the clasp cover with your fingers, you may need to insert a small metal coin or flat screwdriver into the space beneath the lip. Use this tool as a lever; press down on the end hanging outside of the clasp, causing the end inside the clasp to lift up and pry open the cover from beneath.  Open the entire deployment clasp, stretching it out until it reaches its maximum length.   If the band has already been attached at both ends, the band will also expand to its full (adjusted) length. If the band has not been attached at one end, though, you can only open the clasp to its full extended length. Note that this type of clasp folds out into three hinged parts, creating a “z” shape.  Slip the band over your hand and wrist, then press the cover back down to close the deployment clasp.   Fold the clasp thirds back up in their natural orientation. Place your thumb beneath the bottom part of the open clasp end and your index finger over the cover at the open end. Pinch the top and bottom together in between your fingers, continuing until you hear a click. Once the clasp clicks into place, it should be securely closed.  This style of deployment clasp has a push button on one side of the unhinged edge of the clasp.   Some versions have two buttons—one on either side of the clasp. The push buttons on these clasps control the opening mechanism. They offer additional security and prevent the clasp from opening on its own.  Press the button into the side of the clasp. Hold it down as you lift the unhinged edge up and open.   For two-button models, you will need to press both buttons simultaneously. You can release the buttons as soon as the clasp is open.  Continue opening the clasp until you have expanded it to its fullest length.   This type of deployment clasp should fold out into three hinged portions, creating a zigzag or “z” shape. If the band has already been adjusted, place it over your hand and onto your wrist while it is expanded like this. If the band has not been adjusted, do so now.  Fold the clasp thirds back up, pushing the top and bottom in between your fingers until you hear a click.   You should not need to use the push buttons to close the clasp. After clicking into place, the clasp should be closed and secure.  Look for the latch covering the unhinged portion of the deployment clasp. Pull the latch up and away from the clasp.When folded down, this latch prevents the opening mechanism from engaging. It also prevents the opening of the actual clasp from getting snagged.  Locate the push button on the side of the deployment clasp. Press it in while simultaneously lifting the clasp up and away from the security latch.   Note that some versions have a button on either side of the clasp. You will need to press both buttons at the same time to open this type of clasp. You must press these buttons to trigger the opening mechanism. Do not attempt to open the deployment clasp with force alone.  Open the deployment clasp until it expands out as far as possible.   This type of deployment clasp is also made of three hinged portions arranged in the same zigzag manner as the standard and push button varieties. If you haven't adjusted the band yet, do so now. If you have adjusted the band, this is when you should slide it around your wrist.  Fold up the clasp thirds, stacking them one on top of the other. Squeeze the entire clasp in between your thumb and index finger until you hear it click closed.   You should not need to use the push buttons to close the clasp. Gentle force should be enough.  Return to the separate latch lying next to the deployment clasp. Push it back toward the clasp, then press it down onto the clasp until you hear a click.   After clicking this latch closed, the opening mechanism should be secured and the entire deployment clasp is considered closed.  Look for the point at which the two band ends meet. Grab each end near this point and simultaneously pull them away from each other.   The deployment clasp itself is actually located on the inside of the band, so you won't be able to see it from the front. As you pull the two ends apart, the resulting pressure should be enough to engage the opening mechanism of the clasp and cause it to lift away from the band. Note that some versions of the hidden deployment clasp also have push buttons on either side of the clasp. For this type, you will need to push both buttons in while simultaneously pulling the joined ends of the band apart.  Continue opening the band by spreading the separate ends apart as far as they will go. The deployment clasp should expand until it is nearly flat.   This style of deployment clasp differs slightly from the other common types. There are still three separate metal pieces connected by hinges, but instead of opening into a "z" shape, the longest of these sections will lift straight up while being supported by the other two sections, forming something closer to an "n" shape. With the clasp expanded, adjust the band or, if previously adjusted, put the band onto your wrist.  Bring the two band ends back together, holding them as close to each other as possible.   This will draw the deployment clasp near the band, but under most circumstances, it won't actually be enough to close the clasp.  While holding the band ends together, use your thumb or index finger to push the flattened clasp into the back of the band. Continue pushing until you hear it snap or click into place.   Even if the clasp has push buttons on it, you should not need to use them while closing it. After clicking the clasp into the back of the band, it should be closed and secured.  

open the deployment clasp.  pry open the flap.  thread the strap through.  secure the length of the strap.  put on the watch.  wear as desired.  grab the clasp on the open end.  pry the cover up.  extend the band to its full length.  push the cover back down to close it.  locate the button.  push the button.  spread open the clasp.  push the cover back in place.  flip open the latch.  press the button.  expand the band as much as possible.  fold the cover back in place.  close the latch.  pull away the joined ends of the band.  expand the band.  push the band back together.  press the clasp down. 

 The easiest way you can act like you have a boyfriend online is by making posts about your relationship together. Publically compliment your boyfriend via your social media account, and keep your online social circle up to date about romantic nights you're not actually having.   Don't go overboard with these posts, as they often tend to be annoying to other people, especially to those who are having trouble finding a relationship of their own.  Whatever your reason for faking a relationship, do your best to make yourself feel the way you would if you were really with someone. Visualize the thoughts and feelings that normally distinguish being single from being in a relationship, and try to emulate the latter as best as you can. For example, being in a relationship may lead to you making cheerier posts online, rather than unhappy ones.  A picture as basic as two coffee cups on a table with an appropriate caption will make it seem like you're out doing things with someone special. Even if you won't have an actual boyfriend to photograph, the implication is often enough.   A caption is a vital part of creating the illusion. Make it affectionate and romantic. For instance, if you have two coffee cups set up, you can say something like "Drinking my favourite coffee with my favourite guy."  , Upon paying, you'll normally get custom-made voicemails, cutesy texts, and a believable backstory on how the two of you met in the first place. If you need a quick way to act like you have a boyfriend, delegating some of the creativity to professionals may be the very help you need.  

make statuses about your relationship.  act cheerful and upbeat online.  stage pictures that imply a relationship.although people may be suspicious of a faked profile, a fake boyfriend will seem that much more real if you stage pictures in the real world.  try a virtual boyfriend service.there are virtual relationship services that will give you the experience of having a fake relationship for a monthly fee. 

 Place the spool of thread on the spool pin at the top of the machine. Hold it in place by slipping the spool holder onto the pin, as well.   If you are using a small spool of thread, place the cap on the pin so that the small side is next to the spool.; , Feed the thread through the thread guides and around the bobbin winder tension discs.   Snap the thread into the small plastic thread guide lying directly to the left of the spool pin. With the thread held in place by the thread guide, wind the thread clockwise around the bobbin winder tension discs in front of the guide.  Insert the thread through the top hole of the empty bobbin spool.   Feed the thread through from the inside so that the tail is still on the outside of the bobbin. If you're using a bobbin with holes on both sides, only slip the thread through one hole.  Place the bobbin on the bobbin winding spindle, located to the far right of the machine. Lock the spindle in place.   The tail of thread should still stick out through the top of the bobbin. To lock the spindle in place, push the bobbin as far to the right as it will go. This sets the machine to its "bobbin winding" mode.  Hold the thread tail and gently step on the foot control pedal. The machine should begin to wind the bobbin.   If desired, you can let go of the thread tail after the bobbin has wound a few rotations, but doing so is not necessary. The machine should automatically stop once the bobbin is full. Note that the hand wheel should not turn and the machine should not sew while the machine is in its bobbin winding mode.  Cut the thread to separate the bobbin from the spool. Unlock the bobbin winding spindle and lift the bobbin away to remove it.Unlock the spindle by pushing it back to the left. Note that the machine will not sew until the bobbin winding spindle is back in its left position. You should also trim the tail of thread sticking out from the top bobbin hole after removing the bobbin.  Turn the hand wheel at the side of the machine until the needle reaches its highest point.   Turn the machine off before threading the needle. Rotate the hand wheel toward you. Raise the presser foot to release the tension discs at this time, as well.  Place the spool of thread on the spool pin at the top of the machine. Fit the spool cap on the pin next to the spool of thread.   You'll need to lift up the spool pin before you can position the spool of thread on it. For larger spools, the large side of the cap should face the spool. For smaller spools, the small side of the cap should face the spool.  Draw the thread through the upper thread guide, then guide it around the guide an through the pre-tension spring.The upper thread guide is a latch lying to the left of the spool pin. The pre-tension spring lies inside of a second latch positioned in front of the upper thread guide.  Guide the thread down through the right channel at the front of the machine, then back up through the left channel.   You may need to pinch or hold the thread between the spool and the upper thread guide while doing this to maintain an appropriate amount of tension.  Slide the thread into the slot of the take-up lever at the top of the left channel.   After inserting the thread through the take-up lever, pull it back down through the left channel again.  Guide the thread through the horizontal lower thread guide and into the thin wire clamp guide.   The horizontal thread guide is a flat clip lying beneath the left channel. The thin wire needle clamp is positioned directly above the needle.  Feed the thread through the eye of the needle, inserting it from front to back.   Pull 6 to 8 inches (15.25 to 20.3 cm) of thread through to the back of the needle.  Press this lever down as far as it will go. The threader should swing into its threading position.This lever should be located to the left of the needle. Note that these instructions only apply to models of the machine equipped with an automatic needle threader. Standard needle threading instructions still apply when you use an automatic threader. This feature only assists you with inserting the thread through the eye of the needle; the rest of the process should be treated exactly the same way. Even if your machine has this feature, you can still thread the needle by inserting it through the eye without assistance. This feature is only optional.  Swing the thread down and around the thread guide hook to the left of the needle.  Drag the thread through the hook lying directly to the right of the needle.   After inserting it through the hook, wrap the thread around that hook from bottom to top.  Push the threading lever back up to release the automatic threading system. In doing so, you should cause a loop of thread to swing into the eye of the needle.   Grab that loop of thread and pull it through to the back of the needle. Pull 6 to 8 inches (15.25 to 20.3 cm) of thread through the eye.  Turn the hand wheel at the side of the machine toward you until the needle reaches its highest position.   Make sure that the machine is off while you insert the bobbin.  Open the hinged cover at the front of the machine and pull the bobbin case straight out.   To open the cover, grab it along the side and push it down. The cover will open but will not detach. To remove the bobbin case, pull on the bobbin case tab and lift the case straight toward you.  Hold the bobbin case with one hand while slipping the wound bobbin into the case with the other.The thread should run in a clockwise direction around the bobbin as you insert it into the case. Keep a tail of thread roughly 4 inches (10 cm) long out of the case as you insert the bobbin.  Grab the remaining tail of thread and pull it through the slit at the top of the bobbin case.   Continue sliding the thread through that slit until it slips under the finger of the case.  Hold the loaded bobbin case by its hinged latch and slip it back into its place in the machine.   Release the latch. If the case has been positioned correctly, it should be secure inside the machine. You should not be able to remove it unless you lift the hinged latch again. Close the cover when done by pushing it back up and into place.  Turn the hand wheel at the side of the machine toward you. Continue until the needle goes through a full rotation, lowering into the machine and rising back out to its highest position.For the sake of safety, it is best to do this while the machine is off. The presser foot should also be raised during this procedure. As you turn the wheel, you should see a loop of thread appear through the needle plate hole beneath the needle. This loop of thread is from the bobbin.  Gently tug on the upper thread to release the loop and bring the lower bobbin thread completely through the needle plate hole.   Pull 6 to 8 inches (15.25 to 20.3 cm) of bobbin thread out through the plate.  Position both threads so that they lie toward the back of the machine.   Both threads must pass beneath the pressure foot. The upper thread will need to slide through the "toes" of the pressure foot. The completion of this step marks the completion of the entire threading process.  

position the spool of thread.  guide the thread.  feed the thread through the bobbin eye.  set the bobbin in place.  step on the foot control pedal.  remove the finished bobbin.  raise the needle.  position the spool.  feed the thread through the upper guides.  thread the tension module.  feed the thread into the take-up lever.  pass the thread through the lower guides.  thread the needle.  press the automatic threading lever.  direct the thread through the thread guide.  position the thread in front of the needle.  release the lever and pull the thread.  lift the needle.  remove the bobbin case.  insert the bobbin into the case.  pull the thread through the slit.  return the bobbin case to the machine.  rotate the needle.  pull up the lower thread loop.  arrange both threads. 

 An outline is a useful way of focusing your attention on just the most important information. With an outline, you capture only the most important words, thus allowing you to retain what matters the most.   When creating an outline, make sure to put the information in your own words. This will make the information more meaningful and easier to recall. If you are copying someone else’s outline, also use your own words. Otherwise, you are likely to forget the information., It might seem like a waste of time, but rewriting your notes helps you to retain information. Why? The brain processes writing as a top priority, therefore allowing you to retain more information.Like outlining, make sure you take notes using your own words as well. Also, try and make connections to the information in your notes. For example, connect what you’ve read to something in your own life or to something you’ve read before.  Remember how you used the sentence “every good boy deserves fun (or fudge)” to learn the notes EGBDF in music class? This type of mnemonic device and many others are useful in retaining information while studying.   Create acronyms as a way of retaining information. For example, the acronym H.O.M.E.S is used to remember the five Great Lakes (Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, Superior).Use word and picture associations to recall what you study to connect new words and definitions to words and images that you can easily recall.For example, if you wanted to remember the definition of a waxing moon, you might picture yourself waxing your car, which increases the car’s shine. Therefore, a waxing moon is a moon whose illuminated surface increases., You probably recognize that you have a preferred way of learning. For example, you might prefer auditory learning activities such as listening to a lecture, or perhaps you prefer visual activities such as reading notes.However, the more senses you involve in learning, the more information you will retain.   When reviewing a concept, try to incorporate reading, writing, listening, and speaking throughout your study time. For example, if you were reviewing the parts of the body, you would not only read the definition and function of each part, but also draw a diagram and discuss the importance of each part with a study partner., Flashcards are an easy to make and an effective method for recalling and retaining information. They are also easily portable, so you can take them with you to review at anytime you want.   Create term flashcards by placing the term on one side and the definition on the other side. For math flashcards, write the math problem on one side with examples on the other. To study an illustration, on one side draw a picture with an arrow pointing to the area of focus, and the answer on the other side. 

create an outline.  rewrite your notes.  use memory games (mnemonic devices).  engage your senses.  create study flashcards. 

 Gustar is usually translated into "to like," but when you compare a Spanish sentence using "gustar" to its English equivalent, you'll notice a few differences.Example:  English: I like the food. Spanish: Me gusta la comida.   Even though "I" is the subject of the English sentence, it is not the subject of the Spanish sentence. This much is obvious because of the way "gustar" is conjugated. "Gusta" is the third person singular form of gustar, so "gusta" refers to a single thing or person—in this case, it refers to "la comida."  If "gustar" referred to the first person singular "I," it would be conjugated as "gusto."   Instead of "I like the food," a more direct translation of "Me gusta la comida" would be "The food is pleasing to me.” This version of the sentence places "the food" in the position of subject, as it is in the Spanish version of the sentence.; , An indirect object describes to whom or to what the action is done. In other words, the indirect object in "gustar" sentences refers to the person doing the liking.   In the previous sample sentence, "Me gusta la comida," the indirect object is "me." This is the term used for the first person singular indirect object and roughly translates into "to me." As such, saying "me gusta" would be the same as saying "it is pleasing to me" or "I like it."  , In every sentence using "gustar," you will need to change the subject of the English translation to the indirect object pronoun in the Spanish version.   No matter which verb tense you use in the indicative form, the indirect object pronouns will remain the same. Those pronouns are:First person singular: Me (to me) Second person singular: Te (to you) Third person singular: Le (to he/she/it) First person plural: Nos (to us) Second person plural: Os (to you all) Third person plural: Les (to them)    , Since gustar is almost always used to describe love for objects instead of people, you will almost always use the singular or plural third person conjugation.   For the present indicative:  Third person singular: gusta Third person plural: gustan   Example:  "You like the book" becomes "Te gusta el libro." "You like the books" becomes "Te gustan los libros."   The conjugation of "gustar" will always depend on the subject of the Spanish sentence, but this subject is the object of the English version of the sentence.  Now that you know which parts of the English sentence match up to which parts of the Spanish sentence, you should be able to correctly string the parts of the Spanish sentence together.   Example: Translate "We like the movie" into Spanish using the "gustar" verb.  "We" is the subject in the English sentence, so it will become the indirect object of the Spanish sentence. The first person plural indirect object pronoun is "nos." The object in the English sentence, "the movie," becomes the subject of the Spanish sentence, "la película." Since the subject of the Spanish sentence (la película) is singular, "gustar" needs to be conjugated into its third person singular form, "gusta."   When you piece the entire thing together, the Spanish translation would be: Nos gusta la película.  You can technically use "gustar" when discussing like for another person or people, but doing so implies physical attraction instead of platonic/friendly affection.The only time you would use either first person or either second person conjugation of "gustar" would be if you are referring to physical attraction toward yourself (first person) or toward the person you are speaking to (second person).  Example: "Me gustas" in Spanish means "You are pleasing to me" in English.   You may also use either the singular or plural third person form of "gustar" when describing physical attraction toward another person or group of people other than the person you are speaking with.  Example: "Me gusta ella" in Spanish means "She is pleasing to me" in English.  Oftentimes, the reader or listener will not know who the indirect object pronoun refers to when you use the third person singular form. As a result, you may need to add a little more to the sentence for the sake of clarification.This is usually done by adding "To _____" before the indirect object pronoun. In essence, you are referring to the same indirect object twice in the same sentence. This might seem strange in English, but it's normal in Spanish.  Note that the English "to" translates to "a" in Spanish.   Example: If you wrote, "Le gusta la cocina," the reader would have no way of knowing who the kitchen (la cocina) is pleasing to (le gusta). "Le" can refer to too many possibilities.  If Pablo likes the kitchen, you would need to precede the sentence with, "A Pablo." As such, the correct sentence would be: "A Pablo le gusta la cocina."    , Even when the indirect object pronoun can only refer to one specific person, you may still see the "A ___" construction.   In these instances, you are emphasizing the way the indirect object feels. For instance, someone saying "A mí me gusta la silla" would be emphasizing the fact that he or she really likes chair (la silla). Usually, this is done to draw attention to or contrast against other opinions.  When you want to talk about something that is disliked, you will need to add “no” before the verb “gustar” just as you would with any other verb. This “no” must also come before the indirect object pronoun.   Do not place the “no” in between the indirect object pronoun and the verb. Example:  English: I dislike the book Spanish: No me gusta el libro.  As it applies to "gustar," the present indicative should be used to talk about something that is presently liked.   Example: "We like you all," Nos gustáis.  yo: gusto tú: gustas él/ella/usted: gusta nosotros/-as: gustamos vosotros/-as: gustáis ellos/ellas/ustedes: gustan  , The preterite indicative is a past tense verb form. You should conjugate "gustar" in the preterite indicative to describe something that was definitely liked in the past but no longer liked in the present.   Example: "Raquel liked baseball when she was young," A Raquel le gusta el béisbol cuando era joven.  yo: gusté tú: gustaste él/ella/usted: gustó nosotros/-as: gustamos vosotros/-as: gustasteis ellos/ellas/ustedes: gustasteis  , The imperfect indicative is another past tense verb form, but it varies slightly from the preterite tense. Use the imperfect indicative of "gustar" when you want to describe something that was concretely liked in the past and may still be liked in the present.   Example: "You have liked us," Te gustábamos.  yo: gustaba tú: gustabas él/ella/usted: gustaba nosotros/-as: gustábamos vosotros/-as: gustabais ellos/ellas/ustedes: gustaban  , The conditional indicative tense describes something that is true only if another condition is also true. As it applies to "gustar," this verb tense suggests that something is definitely liked as long as another defined condition is also definitely true.   Example: "You all would like the book if you read it," Os gustaría el libro si lo lee.  yo: gustaría tú: gustarías él/ella/usted: gustaría nosotros/-as: gustaríamos vosotros/-as: gustaríais ellos/ellas/ustedes: gustarían  , When talking about definite future events and feelings, you would use the future indicative tense. Conjugate "gustar" in the future indicative to describe a like that will definitely exist in the future without needing any special condition.   Example: "They will like the news," Les gustará la noticia.  yo: gustaré tú: gustarás él/ella/usted: gustará nosotros/-as: gustaremos vosotros/-as: gustaréis ellos/ellas/ustedes: gustarán  

compare "gustar" to its english equivalent.  understand how indirect objects work.  change the english subject to a spanish indirect object.  choose the singular or plural form of "gustar.",  string everything together.  use caution when applying "gustar" to people.  clarify the indirect object when necessary.  emphasize the indirect object when appropriate.  place the negative “no” before the indirect object pronoun.  conjugate the present indicative.the present indicative is the primary conjugation and the one you'll usually need to learn first.  use the preterit indicative.  know the imperfect indicative.  learn the conditional indicative.  use the future indicative. 

 Research the species before you get one.   Fire-bellied toads are brightly colored, diurnal (active during the day), and quite hardy; a combination that’s hard to beat. Most are dull to bright green with a bright red, orange or yellow ventral (underbelly) side. Their entire body is covered in warty black spots and blotches, which are broader on their ventral region, and form a reticulated pattern. The dorsal side of some captive toads can be dark muddy green, dark black or brown instead of bright green. It is believed that this is caused by an improper diet, light levels, stress, improper temperature, humidity, or a combination of all the above. Just remember that just because their skin is warty it doesn't mean that give you warts. It's just how their skin has evolved. Fire-bellied toads reach 1.5 and 2.5 inches (3.8 and 6.3 cm). Males are usually smaller than females and can be distinguished by their more streamlined appearance and vocal ability. The ventral side of fire-bellied toads is bright to advertise their toxicity, and some will flip over to expose this when threatened. These amphibians are toxic, but only in the wild. In captivity, where their poison food source is not available they can cause only mild stomach irritation in say a dog who eats them or a hardy "blech" if tasted by a human.; ,, Use a secure screen cover to prevent escapes while providing proper ventilation. The standard enclosure size applies to these toads as does apply to all frogs and toads: 2.5 -10 gallons (9.46–37.85 liters) per toad. The enclosure should be all glass with the above mentioned screen top. You can use the metal screen tops that rest on the top of the aquarium or the pre-installed sliding screen tops; either one is fine.   Fire-bellied toads are semi-aquatic amphibians that should be provided with both a land and clean water area. The land area can compose roughly one half to two thirds of the floor area, and should contain hide spots such as cork bark, driftwood, rocks, coconut halves, and live or fake plants. The best substrates to use are:  Soil Java moss Sheet moss Coconut husk fiber Jungle soil (pre-packaged and shrink-wrapped) Large grain 1/2" (1.27cm) river rock/gravel   These are suitable substrates which will prevent the toads from swallowing earth, like small grade gravel, while eating. These toads rarely swim underwater, but prefer to float at the surface or near a shoreline. The water depth should gradually slope towards the gravel to allow for easy access and exit.  These can be placed on land or in deep water to allow the toads the chance to rest in water, if needed and/or hide to feel safe. Some suggestions for appropriate decorations are:   African Driftwood - which is a misnomer as this wood sinks like a stone Artificial branches and driftwood Coconut Shells (Sold as a half a shell with a little rounded outdoor/opening) Aquatic plants Large rocks  , The dish can be as simplistic as a plastic storage container, or large commercially available water dishes. These dishes can be submerged into a safe soil substrate, such as the ones listed above to provide easy access to the water. Because the volume of water is low in this type of container, it can become soiled quickly, and for this reason the water should be changed daily.   Another suitable semi-aquatic habitat is to create a small shoreline setup. 1/2” (1.27cm) river rock can be pushed to one side to form a thick layer of gravel that creates a land area, while the layer of gravel on the other side can remain thin. The aquarium can then be filled with enough water so that the water level remains just below the surface of the land area.  Fire-bellied toads are tolerant of a wide range of temperatures, which is one of the reasons they make good captives. Daytime temperatures should range from 72°F to 78°F (22°C to 26°C) and can drop at night to 65º-70º (18ºC to 21ºC). Cool temperatures are tolerated well, and occasional drops down to 60°F (16°C) don’t present a problem for short periods of time.    Avoid temperatures above 85°F (29°C). With this in mind, keep their enclosure away from windows. This is the case for all enclosed creatures. Temperature control can be easy for these little critters as if you're comfortable in your home with the temperature, so will they be.  Set this lighting on a timer to help prevent forgetfulness in turning the light on and/or off. Any standard UV bulb will do. Growth bulbs can be used if using live plants. You can purchase regular UV bulbs at any hardware supplier and the growth bulbs can be purchased at pet stores, online, and at hydroponics shops.  If tap water is used it should be treated with a tap water conditioner to remove all chlorine, chloramines and heavy metals. Bottled spring water can and should be used instead of tap water. Change this water daily. Make sure the water level is relatively low as these frogs are not adept at swimming and can drown easily. Keep in mind that the lower level of water you provide, the more often it must be cleaned.  In captivity they can be fed a diet that consists largely of crickets. Never use garden insects. They have most likely been exposed to herbicides and/or pesticides. Other invertebrates include:   Wax worms Small silkworms Soldier Fly maggots Dubia Roaches - These roaches are unable to climb glass. Moths Houseflies Red Wiggler Worms   Food can be offered in a small feeding dish to prevent them from burrowing into the substrate or wandering into and fouling the water areas. Inset the food dish within the substrate to allow for easy access. A feeding schedule of two to six food items per toad every 2 to 3 days is recommended. Juvenile animals should be fed daily in small quantities.         It’s important that any uneaten food or dead feeders are removed from the enclosure to prevent disease and/or injury to the toads. Do not provide food items larger then the frog can eat. Simple rule:  , This rule does not apply to worms. But be weary of worms that are too fat.  You should dust their food with reptile/amphibian vitamins and calcium once every other feeding. A good recommendation is to rotate between vitamin one feeding and calcium the next feeding. Juvenile’s should have their food dusted at every feeding.  

know what you're getting into.  in order to purchase these toads, you should contact your local exotic animal store and be sure to only purchase from sustainable captive bred facilities.  ,  get a standard ten+ gallon aquarium, which is usually large enough for a group of 2-4 adults.  add ornaments/decorations.  create a semi-aquatic setup in a small aquarium by using a large water dish for a water area.  control the temperature.  provide of a photoperiod of 12-14 hours with fluorescent lighting.  provide a source of clean water at all times.  fire-bellied eat soft-bodied invertebrates.  the food shouldn't be longer than the width of the toad's head. 

 There are certain factors that can make you more prone to lightheadedness. Knowing these can help you and your doctor identify the cause of your lightheadedness and the best way to rid yourself of it.If you are over the age of 65 years, you are more likely to have a medical condition or take medications that causes lightheadedness.Medications including drugs to lower blood pressure or pain, prevent seizures, sedatives and tranquilizers can cause lightheadedness.If you’ve experienced past episodes of lightheadedness, you're more likely to get them in the future.; , Lightheadedness is often easily treated through self-care, but if you experience unexplained, recurring, or severe lightheadedness, see your doctor. This will help rule out more serious conditions and find the best way to get rid of your lightheadedness.If you have unexplained, quick onset, and severe lightheadedness accompanied by the symptoms such as head injury, severe headache, a very stiff neck, blurred vision, sudden hearing loss, trouble speaking, leg or arm weakness, and chest pain or rapid slow heart rate, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room to rule out a serious condition.Your doctor will ask you questions about the symptoms of lightheadedness you have as well as about any medical conditions you have and medications you take. Keep a log of the times you feel lightheaded to share with your doctor. Your doctor may order tests or an MRI to pinpoint the cause of your lightheadedness.If your doctor doesn’t find a cause and your lightheadedness continues, your doctor will discuss possible medications you can take or self-care measures you can use to make your symptoms manageable., Depending on the results of your doctor’s visit and possible tests, your doctor will prescribe treatment to manage your lightheadedness. Your doctor may prescribe medications or suggest managing your lightheadedness with self-care.   If your lightheadedness is cause by an inner ear conditions, your doctor may prescribe balance retraining exercises, which is also called vestibular rehabilitation. You may also get a prescription for meclizine (Antivert), diazepam (Valium), or dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) to help immediately alleviate nausea and lightheadedness.If you have Meniere's disease, which causes the sensation of spinning, your doctor may prescribe a diuretic and dietary changes, such as a low-sodium diet, to minimize how much fluid your body is retaining.If you have lightheadedness because of vestibular migraine, your doctor may help you figure out what triggers your attacks, such as diet, stress, sleep and exercise. Your doctor may also prescribe to help prevent attacks or relieve nausea.If you suffer from an anxiety disorders, your doctor may prescribe medications and psychotherapy that may relieve your anxiety and dizziness.If you have anemia, or low iron levels, your doctor may suggest self-care through dietary changes.If you have hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, your doctor may suggest self-care through eating regular, healthy meals and carrying a snack.Heart conditions such as abnormal heart rhythm, or arrhythmia, may decrease your blood volume causing orthostatic hypotension, or low pressure when you stand up from lying or sitting down.Your doctor may suggest the self-care treatment sitting down and allowing your circulation to stabilize when this happens.Some medications, including anti-seizure drugs, sedatives, and tranquilizers can also cause lightheadedness and your doctor may re-evaluation your use of these treatments if they’re causing your lightheadedness., No matter the cause of your lightheadedness, stop what you're doing and rest for a couple of minutes. This will help your circulation and brain adjust.Continuing to move or moving suddenly can make your lightheadedness worse, and may cause you to lose your balance.If you are not laying down and are able, consider putting your head on or between your knees. This will also help stabilize your blood flow and stop your lightheadedness., Making sure that you are getting enough oxygen can help relieve lightheadedness. Taking deep, steady breaths will help to get your body vital oxygen, but also calm you down.Try breathing to a count to help you focus on stabilizing your oxygen levels and pulse. For example, you can inhale for a count of four and exhale for a count of four. Choose a count that suits you best.Breathing slowly and deeply will help decrease an elevated heart rate, which also can make you feel lightheaded., Both low blood sugar and low iron levels can cause you to feel lightheaded. Making sure that you are eating healthy and regular meals can help you avoid feeling lightheaded.Natural, whole foods including lean proteins, fruits and vegetables, and legumes will help you maintain normal blood sugar throughout the day, making you less likely to have a spell of lightheadedness. If you often suffer from lightheadedness because of low blood sugar, consider carrying a snack like a granola bar or an apple with you to combat any symptoms that might flare up. If you have low iron levels, incorporate more iron-rich foods into your diet to maintain safe levels of iron and help decrease the likelihood of lightheadedness. Examples of iron-rich foods are red and organ meats such as beef and liver, spinach, and dried beans.In some cases, not having enough sodium in your diet can cause lightheadedness. Dissolve a teaspoon of salt into a glass of water and this may help regulate your circulation and relieve your lightheadedness., Consuming enough liquids every day can keep you from feeling lightheaded. In hot weather, staying hydrated will also help you from overheating.You should drink at least 10 glasses of liquid a day to prevent dehydration. Drink 2 US quarts (2,000 ml) or 2 liters of cool liquids every 2 to 4 hours to relieve dehydration and overheating.Water is the best way to stay hydrated, but you can also drink other liquids such as tea, fruit juice, sports beverages, or non-caffeinated soda.Hyperthermia, or overheating, and dehydration can make you feel lightheaded. Resting in a cool place and drinking water or a sports drink (Gatorade, Powerade, others) will usually help ease the dizzy feeling.Remove as many clothes as possible to keep yourself cool and from losing any more fluids., Certain stimulants including caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, illegal drugs, affect your circulation and increase your pulse. Avoiding these substances will help you prevent lightheadedness or keep it from getting worse., If you are experiencing frequent episodes of lightheadedness, especially unexplained lightheadedness, avoid driving a car or operating other heavy machinery.In addition, you may need rest to help relieve your symptoms of lightheadedness. Arranging for friends, family, or colleagues to help you with transportation and other activities while you’re experiencing lightheadedness can ensure that you don’t seriously injure yourself or someone else.Keeping your home well lit and free of hazards that might cause you to trip or fall will also help you avoid serious injury. 

be aware of risk factors.  see your doctor.  use medical treatment for lightheadedness.  take a break from whatever activity you’re doing.  take deep, steady breaths.  make sure you’re eating healthy, regular meals.  avoid dehydration and overheating.  avoid substances that can make lightheadedness worse.  arrange for help during bad episodes of lightheadedness. 

 Catching Pikachu in the wild is a little more difficult, but is possible. He can appear anywhere, but he has been reportedly found frequently near power plants and science museums, presumably because of his connection to electricity. If you have a power plant or another source of electricity local to you, this may be a good place to check first., Trainers have also seen Pikachu appear as late as 3am. Try waiting until very late to up your chances of encountering Pikachu in the wild.  When Pikachu is near, you'll see its silhouette appear in the sidebar in the bottom-right corner of your screen.  If you see a Pikachu silhouette in your nearby list and then see rustling grass on your map, you may be in luck. Head to the grass and a Pikachu may appear.  It's time to try to catch it!  , Swipe the Pokéball towards Pikachu to attempt to capture it. If you don't miss, and if Pikachu doesn't burst out of the ball, it's yours!  

check at power plants or science museums.  wait until the dead of night.  check your nearby list.  head check the rustling grass.  tap on pikachu to enter "capture" mode.  throw a pokéball at pikachu to catch it. 

 Ask your friend to stand next to you, facing your right shoulder. You'll be picking him up with the "fireman's carry," which can make it surprisingly easy.; , Shift your right leg so it is between your friend's feet. Put more weight on this leg, so it is ready to support your friend.  Bring your left hand across your chest to grasp your friend's right wrist or forearm. Lift your friend's arm over your head and duck forward, placing it across your neck and shoulders.When finished, you should be bent forward slightly, with our left hand back on your left side. Maintain a firm grip on your friend's arm.  Carefully move your right arm off the other person. Now squat slightly, keeping your back as straight as you can while supporting the weight of the larger person. When you're low enough to reach his legs, slip your right arm between his knees. Grasp the back and side of his right knee with your hand.   Your left hand should keep a firm grip on his right arm this whole time.  You should now have a firm grip on his right forearm and the back of his right knee. Use these grips to pull him onto your shoulders. When you're finished, he should be positioned like this:   His legs dangle in front of your right shoulder. Your hand is firmly and easily gripping one knee. His torso is mostly straight across your shoulders. His right arm is pulled in front of you.  Lift with your legs and hips, never your back. Keep your back as straight as possible, bent forward just enough to support your friend. If necessary, adjust your friend to balance his weight more evenly.  Move your friend's right arm across your chest. With your other hand, let go of your friend's knee and wrap your arm around his leg. Grasp your friend's right arm with your right hand. Your left hand should now be free to help you balance as you walk around. 

position yourself.  place your right leg between his feet.  bring your friend's right arm behind your neck.  bring your right arm down to his right knee.  bring him onto your shoulders.  stand.  move your friend's arm. 

 The construction of your handheld EMP device will go most smoothly if you have all the tools and components required for construction on hand. You will need:   AA battery AA battery holder Copper wire Cardboard Disposable camera (with flash) Electrical tape Iron core (circular shaped preferred) Rubber gloves (recommended) Simple electrical switch Solder and soldering iron Walkie-talkie antenna, Inside your disposable camera, you will see a main circuit board that controls the functions of your camera. Remove the batteries first, and then remove the circuit board, taking note of the position of the flash capacitor.Wearing rubber gloves can save you from getting an electric jolt while handling your camera circuit and flash capacitor. Capacitors generally look like cylinders attached to the circuit board with two prongs. This will be a necessary component for you EMP device. Expend the charge in your capacitor by engaging the flash after removing the batteries from your camera. Any stored charge in your camera can result in an electrical shock.  Be sure that you have an adequate length of copper wire; your wrap should evenly and completely cover your iron core. You should also wrap your wire tightly, as a loose winding will negatively impact your EMP.Leave some excess copper wire at the ends of your winding. You will need this to connect the rest of your EMP device to your electromagnetic coil.  You walkie-talkie antenna will serve as the stock onto which you fix your electromagnetic coil and camera circuit board. Wrap the base end of your walkie-talkie antenna with electrical tape as a preventative measure for being shocked.  Your cardboard will serve as another insulator to prevent any unpleasant electrical shocks. Use your electrical tape, taking care not to cover any of the electric pathways of your camera circuit, and attach it to your piece of cardboard.   You'll want to attach your camera circuit face up so that the capacitor and its connection pathways aren't interfered with by the cardboard. Your cardboard mount for your camera circuit should have some additional space for your AA holder.  Since current will be running through your coil to create your EMP, it's a good idea to double insulate your antenna by putting another small piece of cardboard between your coil and the antenna. You can then use your electrical tape to attach your coil to the cardboard.  Find the battery connector tabs on your camera circuit and connect them to the corresponding positive and negative ends of your AA battery holder.This can then be attached to a free space on your cardboard camera circuit mount with electrical tape.  The excess wire that you left at the beginning and end of your copper wire winding will need to be soldered to the electrodes of your flash capacitor. To control the flow of electricity between your capacitor and electromagnetic coil, you should tie in your electrical switch between these two components.You should wear rubber gloves during this portion of your EMP device assembly. Any remaining charge in your capacitor could shock you.  Use your electrical tape to firmly attach your cardboard mount and its component to your antenna. You should attach your mount above the base of your antenna, which you should have already insulated with electrical tape.  A simple, inexpensive calculator is ideal for testing your handheld EMP device. Depending on the materials and technique you used in the construction of your device, the range of your EMP field may include only the immediate vicinity of your coil, or it may reach up to several feet around the coil.   Any electronics caught in your EMP could be permanently damaged. Make sure you have chosen a location far enough away from electronics that you don't inadvertently do harm. You could be liable for any damage you cause with your EMP.  Check that the switch for your device is set to off, and then install your batteries in to the AA battery holder on your cardboard mount. Grasping your EMP device by the insulated base of the antenna, like a Ghostbuster Neutron Wand, hold your electromagnetic coil toward your test object and flick your switch to the "On" position.   If you are not confident in your knowledge or construction of electrical components, you may want to wear a pair of rubber glove when operating your device, as an added precaution. If your device has successfully worked, your test object, and any other electronics caught in your EMP field, will not turn on. Depending on the kind of flash capacitor you have used, the voltage required to charge your capacitor will be variable. The approximate capacitance for a disposable camera should be between 80-160 microfarads, and the voltage will likely be between 180-330 volts. 

gather your materials.  remove your camera circuit board.  wind your copper wire around your iron core.  insulate your walkie-talkie antenna.  affix your camera circuit to a sturdy piece of cardboard.  attach your electromagnetic coil to the end of your walkie-talkie antenna.  solder your power source.  connect your coil to your capacitor.  attach your cardboard mount to your antenna.  find a suitable test object and location.  test your handheld emp device. 

 If your grandmother or neighbor doesn’t know Spotify from a spotted owl, but finally wants to join that Facebook thing or pay bills with the computer, they are probably willing to pay a little for your expertise.There’s no reason to price-gouge Granny, of course, but most people, even family members, are probably happy to pay a little for help in setting up a new computer or wi-fi network.  Most computer novices would also probably prefer to pay a little for help from someone they know and can deal with in person, rather than rely on phone calls or online chats and tutorials.Don’t get in over your head, however. If you don’t know how to help with a problem, say so and advise that the person get in touch with customer service or tech support. It can be frustrating to attempt to tutor someone who knows very little about a product or skill that seems second nature to you. Be patient, and think about all the things your favorite uncle has taught you before scoffing at his lack of a clue about how to fix his router or sell his baseball cards.  Sometimes it isn’t even a question of knowledge, but of time. If you have it, and others don’t, you may be able to make some money doing some computer “grunt-work” for them. For example:Digitize boxes of old photos or scan documents for a relative or neighbor. Edit and upload or order prints for someone who has a camera card full of photos and no idea how (or time) to do anything with them. Convert home movies to DVD, or even edit scattered videos and photos (such as from a wedding) into a movie everyone will appreciate. Design and/or print photos, logos, designs, banners, invitations, flyers, and so on for others., Maybe your friend’s Mom is starting a small business and wants a web presence, or a neighbor wants to know how to utilize various social media platforms so he can keep in touch with his grown children.Once again, work according to your skill level. Don’t promise a fully-functional, professional website if you don’t know how to make one. If, however, you can set up a site that draws in page views and ad revenue, maybe you can negotiate for a piece of the profits.  

set up computers and other equipment for novices.  provide tutoring, repairs, or tech support.  digitize, convert, or print materials for others.  design or set up websites. 

 It doesn't really matter which kinds you use, just as long as you can use it well.; , Then put all of it into the jar you had selected.  Ideal time frame should be AT LEAST 1 month. To make it clearer, lets just say you started doing this in June, that means if you use a 1 month time frame, you should start counting how much you have in July.  After the time period had gone by, you should start counting how much you have in the jar. If there's efficient enough of spare change in there, you should start rolling them up with some coin wrappers.  By this point, collecting all the change you could get, go to any good dollar stores around your neighborhood and start buying things with your spare change. You'll be surprised on just how much you could buy with it.  Some banks does accept spare change and if yours does, then consider putting it in the bank account. It can help you gain more interests so it's a good idea to do so. 

get yourself a change jar that you want to use to put all of your spare change in.  collect as much spare change you can find around your house, pockets, couch, etc.  set up a time frame of how long you want to keep doing this for.  during whatever amount of period you decided to do this, make sure you don't touch any of it besides putting it into the jar.  finally, a month had gone by.  consider putting your spare change into a bank account. 

 There are 33.81 fluid ounces (fl oz) in 1 liter. So, to convert fluid ounces to liters, you would divide the number of fluid ounces by 33.81.For example, if a carton of almond milk is 128 fl oz, to convert to liters, you would calculate 128floz÷33.81=3.786L{\displaystyle 128fl\;oz\div 33.81=3.786L}.  There are 2.113 fluid pints (fl pt) in 1 liter. So, to convert fluid pints to liters, you would divide the number of fluid pints by 2.113.For example, if a pitcher has a capacity of 8 fl pt, to convert to liters, you would calculate 8flpt÷2.113=3.786L{\displaystyle 8fl\;pt\div 2.113=3.786L}.  There are 1.057 quarts (qt) in 1 liter. So, to convert quarts to liters, you would divide the number quarts of by 1.057.For example, if a pitcher has a capacity of 4 quarts, to convert to liters, you would calculate 4qt÷1.057=3.784L{\displaystyle 4qt\div 1.057=3.784L}.  There are 3.7854 liters in 1 gallon (gal). So, to convert gallons to liters, you would multiply the number gallons of by 3.7854.For example, if a fish tank has a volume of 120 gallons, to convert to liters, you would calculate 120gal×3.7854=454.248L{\displaystyle 120gal\times 3.7854=454.248L}.   

convert fluid ounces to liters.  convert pints to liters.  convert quarts to liters.  convert gallons to liters. 

 Debt consolidation firms may have different educational prerequisites for different jobs. Some customer service jobs will only require the equivalent of a high school education to be a good candidate.; , Although this is not strictly necessary, you should consider it as a way to ensure success in the debt management field. The following are good educational paths to take.   Seek an associate's degree in financial management or business management. This 2-year degree will allow you to learn the basics of risk management, investments, debt and credit and financial law. These programs can include online and night classes if you are currently working. Seek a bachelor's degree in financial management, business administration, economics or finance. These degrees will give you an in-depth background on how to manage a business and finances. A finance or business degree will also give you some sales and customer management skills that will help you to work in the debt consolidation environment.  Working in telesales will introduce you to working with a sales quota, something you will face in the debt consolidation environment. 2 years of sales experience, while in school or right after, is seen as excellent experience, especially if it is in the financial sector.  Inquire whether you are required to obtain a license with your state licensing board or secretary of state. While license requirements will differ from state to state, working as independent debt manager will usually require you to submit an application, undergo a practice and ethics exam and pay a licensing fee.   A debt consolidator may not be required to become licensed if you are hired and trained by a company. A debt manager title may fall under the licensing requirements of a financial manager, and thus be more highly policed by your state's licensing agency.  Look online for customer service, information technology, debt consolidator and debt manager positions. Also, look in your local newspaper or classified boards to find local debt consolidation agencies.   Create a resume that you can change and focus for each job application. Resumes and cover letters should be tailored to each job description, since no single debt consolidation job is the same. Applying for several different positions may help you discover the best job for you within the debt consolidation industry.  The following are paths you can take, depending upon your interests:   Seek a job with a for-profit debt consolidation company. These companies may offer high commissions for their best consolidators. You will work in a sales environment where you will be required to sell a product to debtors and seek excellent terms from credit card companies. Check that these companies are licensed and accredited before applying. Check their reviews on the Better Business Bureau website to make sure they maintain a high standard of services and ethics. Seek a job with a non-profit debt consolidation company. Most states have non-profit services that help to provide debt consolidation services. In these jobs, you will be mainly working with secured loans, rather than variable loans, and counseling people on changing the way they think about debt and money management. You are likely to work in an environment that values education and counseling over sales quotas. They may offer lower salaries and few sales incentives to their employees. Become a private debt manager. If you are licensed in your state independently, you may choose to market yourself directly to debtors. This path is best taken after 5 to 10 years of experience in financial services or risk management. You can offer personal plans and services that are more in depth than most telephone-based consolidation companies. You may also be able to find a position as an independent worker in a financial services firm.  The success of a debt consolidator is often measured by the terms they can negotiate when they contact a creditor for a debtor. Working as a third party debt consolidator means that you rely on your customer service and negotiation skills while still retaining relationships.  

receive your high school diploma or equivalency.  apply for a degree in higher education.  gain work experience in a sales environment.  obtain a debt management license in your state.  look for jobs at private or non-profit debt consolidation agencies.  apply for jobs according to your industry preferences.  develop excellent relationships with creditors. 

 One of the Basenji’s most distinctive features is its forehead, which displays a Shar-Pei-like wrinkle at all times. This can lend a puzzled or anxious expression to its face, but it’s just the natural fold and texture of its skin.This wrinkle may seem more pronounced in puppies, who have more excess skin and folds. It will also be less noticeable in Basenjis with brindled, black, or tricolored coats.; , Looking at a Basenji, you may recall the sharp, pointed ears of the ancient Egyptian god Anubis. This resemblance is not accidental: in fact, the Basenji is one of the most ancient dog breeds and appears in many Egyptian hieroglyphs as early as 4000 B.C.The Basenji’s ears stand at the top of the flat skull and point directly upward. Many experts argue that this adaptation derives from the fact that Basenjis use both sight and sound to hunt. It’s also thought that the large surface area of the ears helps to dissipate heat.  Basenjis are medium-sized dogs, measuring 16-17 inches at the shoulder and 16-17 inches from chest to buttocks. They are lightly-built dogs, weighing 22-24 pounds.Expect female Basenjis to fall on the lower end of height and weight averages, typically weighing one to two pounds less than males and standing one inch shorter.  A Basenji has short, fine fur. Their most recognizable color is perhaps chestnut red, but they also occur in pure black, tricolor (pure black and chestnut red), and brindle—that is, black stripes on a background of chestnut red.No matter what color the coat is, a Basenji will have white on the feet, chest, and tip of the tail. Sometimes the legs and collar will also be white.  Aside from the Basenji’s erect ears and wrinkled forehead, its tightly curled tail is perhaps its most notable characteristic. Curling back over the dog’s rump, the tail starts thick at its base and tapers into a thinner point.The tightness of the tail’s curl depends on the Basenji’s current mood and excitement level. The more stimulated and buoyant the dog is, the more tightly curled the tail will be.  If you're having trouble deciding whether or not a dog is a Basenji, ask a local expert to help. A veterinarian should be able to check for distinguishing characteristics, or you could visit a local dog club where they might have an expert who can identify this particular breed.  The larynx of the Basenji is shaped differently from most other dogs, meaning that the Basenji doesn’t make the same barking sound that other dogs do. It’s largely silent, making it a great dog for people who have small children or live in apartment buildings.When the Basenji does make a noise, it does so in a whining cry, howl, drawn-out yodel, or short, isolated “fox bark.”, Most Basenji owners remark that Basenji’s behavior more closely resembles that of cats than that of a typical dog. Stubborn, independent, and reserved, it likes to play, but it is unlikely to be a social butterfly in the dog park or with your visiting friends.Like a cat, most Basenjis will form a close bond with only one or two members of the household. Some owners report that Basenjis bond better with dogs of other breeds than they do with dogs of their own breed., Unlike many dog breeds, the Basenji is a fastidious self-groomer and pays particular attention to its paws. Such scrupulousness means that it rarely requires human-assisted bathing and emits minimal odor.In addition to their curiously feline grooming habits, look for little to no shedding., Perhaps one of the most notable behavioral characteristics of the Basenji is its curiosity, craftiness, and destructiveness when left alone. Many Basenji owners report having to keep all cabinets and garbage receptacles tightly locked and countertops kept clean, as their dogs can get into practically anything when left to their own devices.Basenjis will devour any accessible edibles or household products, and they also love to shred paper products, such as tissues, toilet paper, and paper towels.  While Basenjis make great household pets, they aren’t the easiest dogs to train. Their independent natures and ancient instincts make them less submissive than other breeds, so an owner will have to be firm and consistent when handling them.Due to their stubbornness and independence, a Basenji responds best to positive reinforcement. When training their dogs, Basenji owners report best results when rewarding positive behavior with treats rather than scolding or jerking the leash when it does something wrong., Due to their long histories as hunting dogs, Basenjis love to chase anything and everything, including other dogs, squirrels, cats, and small children. Basenjis can still coexist with cats or other dogs, but these other pets will have to either get used to being pursued or learn not to run away from the chase-happy Basenji.A Basenji should not be trusted off the leash in the way that some obedient, low-key breeds can. Likely to bolt the minute it spots a dashing squirrel or dog, it’s particularly vulnerable to getting hit by cars and getting lost. 

look for a wrinkled forehead.  check that both ears are large and erect.  measure and weigh the dog.  inspect the dog's coat.  look for a curled tail.  check with an expert.  listen to what noises the dog makes.  observe the dog’s social demeanor.  look for cat-like grooming behavior.  expect destructive, inquisitive behavior when left alone.  observe the dog’s obedience.  look for chasing and hunting behaviors. 

 Find your lease agreement and review it for an opt-out clause that specifies your rights and responsibilities in the event that you decide to break the lease. This agreement may specify a timeline for giving notice of your intent to leave the lease early and may also specify penalties in the form of fines and lost security deposits.Look for the words "early release," "sub-let," or "re-let" when examining your lease. The exact language may vary between lease agreements.; , Some rental agreements require that you find a replacement renter if you break your lease.Others require that your landlord find a replacement renter after you give them notice of leaving the lease. In this case, you would have to pay for the intermediate months before they find a replacement for you, so plan ahead financially if this is the case. This information can be found in your lease agreement., In most cases, your lease will also specify the required duties of the landlord, including things like responding to complaints and repair requests. If your landlord is not fulfilling their end of the bargain, you may have grounds to break your lease and move out. However, this generally requires taking your landlord to court, which may be more trouble than it's worth.  There may be additional landlord obligations not listed in your lease that can be found in your municipal regulations and state laws. Check these sources for more information.  Because many lease agreements require advance notice when you leave your lease, it's best to communicate your intentions to your landlord as early as possible. In other words, let your landlord know as soon as you decide to go through with breaking your lease. This can give the landlord more time to prepare for your departure and may make them more likely to work with you towards an amenable resolution., Before you do anything else, simply try to explain to your landlord what your situation is. It's likely that they've had other tenants get out of leases before and are likely able to offer a few possible solutions. Hopefully, your landlord will be understanding, although there is no guarantee that they will be. This conversation is always easier if you've been a good tenant, doing things like paying your rent on time and not causing disturbances in the building.Be as open as possible. The more your landlord knows, the more they will be able to help you. For example, be sure to tell them if you are unable to give the required amount of notice., In many states, both you and your landlord are required to work towards finding a replacement renter in the event that you leave your lease early. This replacement can be either a new renter or a sub-letter on your lease. In either case, be prepared to pay your rent for the months until you can find a replacement renter.Finding a sub-letter means finding someone willing to take over payments on your current lease and live in your apartment. The lease, however, will still be in your name, so you are liable for payments being made and any damage done to the apartment by the sub-letter. Check with your Facebook friends to see if they know anyone looking for an apartment. This is the easiest way to get a sub-letter that you trust., If you are unable or unwilling to find a replacement renter, your lease or landlord may offer you the chance to simply pay your way out of the lease with a termination agreement. In many cases, this will involve paying several months rent after you move out and giving up your security deposit. However, you benefit from being immediately and completely out of your lease obligations., Every city, state, or region has its own laws. In order to know how you can legally break your lease, take a look at yours. Once you're familiar with the laws, you can then read deeper into your lease and possibly find a legal reason in your living situation to vacate.#*The remainder of these steps will only work under laws which vary from place to place, and you may end up needing to hire a lawyer. Even then, sometimes the law will not be on your side. Always proceed with caution., Many landlords use standard-form lease agreements. This can potentially lead to errors that will make the lease agreement legally invalid in your city or state. While this will require hiring a lawyer, the overall costs will likely be cheaper than paying the remainder of your rent., Your landlord is required to repair conditions that materially affect the physical health and safety of an ordinary tenant. You have to specify this condition in a notice certified return receipt to the place of which rent is normally paid, and you can’t owe any rent at the time. In most cases, you must give the landlord time to make the repair, and send another written notice before you can take legal action.Examples of these conditions might be:   Mold Termites or other bug infestations Broken smoke detectors Severely loose railing on your balcony Holes in carpeting that could trip someone Security issues (e.g. broken lock, doorknob, or gate) You as the tenant (or any of your friends) can’t cause this condition – so don’t take a sledgehammer to your smoke detector.  If your landlord is violating your privacy rights, that is also grounds for legally breaking a lease. He or she is only allowed on the premises with your knowledge., If your lease doesn't already have a lease-break clause which specifies what you must do in order to break the lease, then you'll have to work this out with the landlord. This is the best way to get out of a lease because you won't burn bridges and taint your rental history. Consider some negotiation points:   Offer up part or all of your security deposit. Offer to continue paying rent for 1-2 months after you vacate. Volunteer to find the next tenant to sign a new lease (you shoulder the costs of placing ads, costs of any screening, and showing the unit to prospective tenants). Finding a replacement renter can also help you avoid paying extra costs or settlement fees., This may be found in your lease as “the landlord’s duty to mitigate damages.” That means that in the situation where you don't pay your rent, your landlord can't just sit back and wait to sue you. They have to make strides to filling your space – and then that money gets taken off your debt. If this is applicable in your area, it may mean you're only required to pay a month or so's rent., If you don't have a legal reason for leaving (and even if you do), give notice that you will be vacating the premises. And be polite about it – the more mature and respectful you are, the less likely your landlord will decide to be a pain in your side. Written notice 30 days prior to leaving is best.Even if your landlord is being difficult, always stay polite. Make sure to communicate via email or in print and keep copies should you need them later. Be honest and thorough, doing everything you can. Threats of a lawsuit can constitute retaliation and bad faith in some jurisdictions. If your landlord does this, get it in writing. It's another point in your favor., Unless you have adequate reason to leave, the law will likely not be on your side. Don't think you can take this to court – it'll likely just add to your debt. After all, you signed a contract. Even if you're not there, you made the promise that you would pay that money.   If you've tried to be nice about it and negotiate, consider contacting a mediator. Often these are publicly-funded. 

look for an opt-out clause.  find a replacement renter, if necessary.  check to see that your landlord is meeting his or her obligations.  talk to your landlord as soon as possible.  explain your situation.  work with your landlord to find a replacement renter.  consider a termination agreement.  check your area's laws.  check to see if your lease agreement is legally valid.  find something in your apartment that is dangerous.  take action if the landlord has violated your right to privacy .  negotiate a lease-break agreement.  check your landlord's "duty to rent.",  give adequate and polite notice.  know that when you break a lease, the law is generally on the landlord's side. 

 It is a proven fact that if you're cold, you get irritated and stressed more easily. Wrap up warm when you go out; wear lots of layers, get a warm scarf and a hat. Thick socks and warm boots are a definite must.; , Whenever you're stressed, take a long, hot bath to warm you all the way through. Use scented bubble bath if you like. And remember: just because it's winter and you need to wrap up, it doesn't mean you can't look nice! Invest in a stylish winter coat to keep the cold at bay and make you look nice.  When December starts rolling in, you need to get cracking to avoid Christmas stress. Even if you don't like to start shopping until a couple of weeks before Christmas, make a list of who you need to send presents to and what you might get them. If you're going away, make sure your flights/travel arrangements and accommodation are all booked in advance.  Being in the sunshine stimulates the release of a hormone in your body that relieves stress, and no amount of unnatural light can create this. In winter, it is especially hard as the sunlight hours are limited. But try to get out in the sun at least once a day, even if only for a few minutes.  Give yourself one thing that will relax you, so that when you're stressed you can leave the room and do that thing. Maybe it's eating chocolate, or taking 5 minutes to yourself. It will train your brain to relax whenever you do that thing.  It gets your heart pumping and keeps you fit. In winter it can be hard to motivate yourself to get to the gym or go outside, but even a 10 minute walk every day is something to get you started. If exercise isn't your thing, try yoga or pilates.  

fight the cold.  pamper yourself.  plan things in advance.  get some sunshine or at the least, light.  treat yourself.  exercise. 

 When you bend metal, you naturally weaken it. When done correctly, however, you can minimize damage and still get the shape you need to complete the project. Keep the following in mind as you work:Always note the grade and size of the bar you're bending, checking against the equipment you're using to ensure it works. Check with your project engineer to ensure your bends meet the minimal internal bend diameter. If you don't know what this is for your project, wait until you do. Never re-bend rebar. Once you've bent it, it's finished. Continually working it will significantly lower its strength.; , These devices usually clamp the rebar down, allowing you to pull down on the free end to bend it. The bar is set on a cast-iron die, allowing you to easily bend it to your desired curve. However, they are slow, only bending one piece at once, and they usually only bend in 90-degree increments, meaning you must guess to get other angles. However, they are also relatively cheap.Cost from $200-500. Can only handle lower-grade steel and sizes.  These electric or gasoline-powered motors are essential if you need a lot of bends quickly, all to a standardized length. Many come with cutters, too, allowing you to sheer overly long bars. Though expensive, and heavy, they are essential for big construction crews who need precise, frequent rebar adjustments. To use it, simply turn it on, set your desired angle and length, and feed in the rebar.   Cost from $3,000-5,000. Can handle any grade steel, or any size., The process of molding or shaping the rebar often causes coatings to chip and flake off. As long as your remember to check and touch up the areas that you've bent, however, you should not have much of an issue. 

understand the structural issues possible with manually-bent rebar and know how to avoid them.  look into a manual bender for a cheap, portable rebar bending solution.  consider getting a power bender to make perfect hooks and bends on the go.  recoat any galvanized or epoxy coated rebar after bending. 

 One way to ensure mold won’t grow in a sippy cup is to buy a cup with fewer parts. These fewer parts make the cleaning process easier. Fewer parts also help you make sure you clean everything.This means there are fewer valves, crevices, and other places for moisture and food to get trapped so mold can grow. Check the way the cup is made before buying it. Because of the issues with mold growing, some companies like Tommee Tippee are developing sippy cups with easier to clean parts.  Another way you can help prevent mold from growing in sippy cups is to replace them on a regular basis. Some people use sippy cups for months, even years. This allows more time for mold to grow from skipped cleanings or liquids remaining in them for too long.Think about replacing your child’s sippy cup every two to four months.  Using disposable sippy cups might be an easy solution to preventing mold. Many disposable sippy cups are cheap enough to replace regularly. Also, many of these disposable sippy cups are made with valve-free lids that are easier to clean and less likely to grow mold.You can find these disposable cups through online or major retailers. Some of the disposable sippy cups are as cheap as $3 for a 6-pack of BPA-free sippy cups.  Another way to prevent sippy cup mold is to get rid of them completely. Instead of sippy cups, use alternatives.Cups with straws may be better for speech development. Try letting your child use a regular cup with some supervision. While it may be messier, it may be healthier and better for her speech and teeth development.  

buy sippy cups with fewer parts.  replace sippy cups often.  consider using disposable sippy cups.  use alternatives to sippy cups. 

 The thin skin around each peanut isn't harmful — in fact, some people prefer leaving it on to eating "naked" nuts. However, if you wish, you can remove the skins easily with a salad spinner. Roll the roasted peanuts in your hands over an open salad spinner, letting them gradually fall out and into the device. Once you've rolled all of the peanuts, close the spinner and run it until most (if not all) of the skins have been separated. You may need to peel a few skins off by hand.Here's another method for skinning peanuts: first, place the roasted peanuts in a jar or container and shake them or wrap them in a clean dish towel and rub them. Pour the peanuts out, then take the jar, container, or towel outside and let the wind blow away the loose skins.  You only need a little seasoning to make natural, roasted peanuts even more delicious. There's no "right answer" here, but just a few seasoning suggestions are included below:   A light dusting of brown sugar and cinnamon makes a delicious sweet treat. Combining Cajun seasoning mix with a little salt makes for intensely flavorful peanuts. Cayenne powder, garlic powder, and smoked paprika can give you red-hot Southwestern-style peanuts., Liquid flavorings can be used as glazes to give the peanuts intense, alluring flavors. However, for best results, these should be applied before the roasting process. Paint the prepared peanuts with a thin layer of your glaze and roast them as normal to give them the glaze's flavor. Since you're using liquid ingredients here, lining your pan with foil or baking paper is a wise idea.   Here, again, there are hundreds of possibilities. One easy classic example is honey-roasted peanuts. To make the glaze, just combine equal parts honey and melted butter and stir until uniform. About two tablespoons of each ingredient should be enough for a pound of peanuts. Paint the peanuts with the glaze and sprinkle with salt before they go into the oven. Roast as normal., Believe it or not, making all-natural peanut butter from (shelled) peanuts is as simple as crushing, chopping, or grinding them into a thick but smooth paste. See our peanut butter recipe for step-by-step directions. As noted above, Spanish peanuts are best for this as they contain the most oil. You can use a food processor, a blender, or a manual solution like a mortar and pestle to get the peanuts to a smooth, creamy consistency.   For chunky peanut butter, chop up a handful of peanuts and add them to the finished peanut butter. Some chefs like to add a dash of honey, molasses, salt, or other seasonings to their peanut butter for flavor. However, it should be fine on its own.  

try skinning shelled peanuts.  use creative seasonings.  make glazed peanuts.  grind your roasted peanuts to make peanut butter. 

 If at all possible, you should see how people in the position you are applying for dress on the job. Follow their precedent. Dress at least as well as them. For lower level positions you probably want to even dress a bit better than the standard work attire, though this is not so much the case for higher level positions, because you also want to refrain from being ostentatious.   It is not common for bank tellers to wear a suit jacket when working. However, if you are interviewing to be a teller, you should. This is also true for women who should wear either a skirt suit or a pantsuit.; , Although bankers dress professionally, they are not fashionistas. Dressing in a way that would attract too much attention or make you stand out will work against you.   One of the most common objections at interviews is smell Wearing too much perfume or cologne can be a distraction and is frowned upon. Wear little if any.Leave the bling at home. Ostentatious watches can create feelings of jealousy. Similarly large, showy jewelry is generally not considered appropriate. Wear something small and simple or nothing at all.Don’t try to exploit your sex appeal. It is not considered appropriate to dress in a provocative way. Wear little makeup and stick to shades that are more or less natural.Stick to simple patterns, if any. Usually ties, suits, shirts, and dresses of a single, conservative color are best. Refrain from bright colors or complex patterns.  For a banking job you will want to devote less time to finding unique attire than to keeping what you have immaculate. Pay close attention to wrinkles, stains, scuffs, and your own personal hygiene. Banking is about paying attention to detail. Your attire should convey your abilities in that regard.   Iron everything that you wear to get out wrinkles. If there are any stains or imperfections in your attire, wear something else. Shoes matter a lot in the banking world. Have your shoes professionally waxed. If there are scuffs, signs of wear and tear, or if the heels are falling off, buy a new pair.Get a professional haircut and manicure. Your hair should be short and you should be clean shaven. Women should have gray hair colored.Keep nails short and clean. Wear clear nail polish or none at all.Remove body piercings and hide tattoos. These are becoming more acceptable in certain institutions, but until you find out otherwise, assume that they are not considered proper professional attire., Men in the banking world are typically expected to wear a handful of items. Usually these items are even expected to be of a standard color. These are as follows:   Wear a business suit that is gray or navy blue. Stick to a blue, green or red silk tie without patterns. The tie should come down to your belt buckle. Do not let it hang below the waist or sit far above it. Stick to a standard knot, like a Windsor.The prototypical shirt in the banking world is a long-sleeve white shirt. Light pastel colors are increasingly considered acceptable as well. If you go this route, be sure that it matches with the tie. For more information read how to match colors of a tie, suit, and shirt  Your pants should be the same color as your suit. Make sure that your pockets are not budging with keys or your wallet. Your socks should be the same color as your pants and your shoes should be the same color as your belt., As with men, there are a handful of standard outfits that are worn in banking. Stick closely to the guidelines and you should not have any trouble.   Wear a skirt suit or pantsuit in navy-blue, black, or gray. Stick to a white or light-blue blouse. The blouse should have a high neck line and long sleeves. Wear skin colored hosiery. Carry a spare, in case it tears. Wear low-heeled close-toed dress shoes. The shoes should match your belt. A brief case is considered more professional than a hand bag.  Familiarize yourself with your company's dress code and dress for your banking job based on those guidelines. The dress code will give you a good understanding of how you're expected to look and ensure that your wardrobe meets banking and company standards.   The dress code will make you aware of the minimum requirements of the job. You should also observe your peers and verify that you are dressing in a way consistent with the local norms.  Ask about casual days within the company or bank branch. On casual days it's often appropriate to wear clothes that would otherwise be considered too casual for the banking industry.   Casual Fridays are not as common as they once were, but they do exist even in high-level investment banks. Barclays has instituted a policy whereby jeans and t-shirts are acceptable on Fridays. Jeans and t-shirts, however, are generally considered too casual even for a casual Friday., Dress for bank employment by starting with comfortable shoes. You'll be on your feet a lot, so choose shoes that can have inserts placed in them to absorb shock and cushion your feet. Stick to closed-toed, low-heel dress shoes.  You should dress for a bank job neatly, cleanly and conservatively. Iron out any wrinkles, tuck in your shirt and don't wear anything stained or ripped. A client or customer that sees these details will change their opinion about you and your bank for the worse. Mend or replace these items so they don't make you look sloppy or unprofessional.  To look professional at your bank job, eliminate any body modifications like piercings or tattoos from your client's line of sight. Keep ear piercings tasteful or small, remove facial and tongue piercings and cover tattoos with pants or long sleeves while you're at work.  Check shirts and sweaters to ensure that they cover your stomach and midriff without exposing too much cleavage. Be sure that your skirts are an appropriate length for the workplace by not wearing any that don't at least reach your fingertips when your hands are down at your sides. Anything shorter, or with a slit that goes higher, isn't appropriate for work attire.  Most of the details of your attire should vary little from what you wore during your interview. If you are employed as a teller though, you might not be expected to wear a suit jacket once you start on the job. Observe what others in your position wear. For any higher ranking position, assume that you should wear a suit jacket and that your attire should vary little from what you wore during your interview.  

dress at least as well as those employed in your position.  dress conservatively.  clean up.  stick to the standards for men.  stick to the standards for women.  read the dress code.  ask about casual days.  choose comfortable and professional shoes.  keep everything neat.  cover piercings and tattoos.  wear clothes that are an appropriate length.  know when to wear a suit jacket. 

 Sometimes, parents use excessive praise as a stand-in for a real connection with their kids. Showing that you noticed an increase in a grade or improvement in a skill isn’t the same as sitting side-by-side with your child, helping them to improve.You can strengthen the power of your praise by having a strong core relationship with your kids. Spend one-on-one time with them. Talk about their successes and struggles often, and help them brainstorm ways they can improve., Parents often lean heavily on empty praise when their child isn’t taking on any new challenges. You run out of things to say, so you repeat the same general statements. Your child can build a sense of autonomy if you regularly help them identify new skills to try, and praise them for their efforts in these activities.Letting them do things on their own shows that you believe in their abilities, which counts much more than empty praise.  The manner in which you praise your child should evolve over time, depending on your child’s developmental stage and unique needs. Typically, younger children require more praise than older children because they have fewer successes under their belt. When your child starts to see themselves as capable of mastering a skill, they don’t count on praise as much.Young children thrive on the observe-comment variety of praise. You see them do something noteworthy and exclaim it, like “Wow, you did it!” Older children require more specifics in terms of their effort or strategy, such as “You have really been practicing on the recital music, Joe. Your sound is incredible!”  , Many parents lean heavily on tangible rewards to get their children to continue positive behaviors. However, parenting experts suggest refraining from using cash as a form of praise.On one hand, cash doesn’t allow you to expound on why they deserve praise, such as effort or strategy. Also, getting cash doesn’t help your child build an appetite for mastery as an internal motivator—they are simply doing it for the money.  

build a solid connection with your kids.  give them opportunities to make mistakes.  be age-appropriate.  skip the bribes. 

 This is the first and most important step in your long journey to inspire creativity in your team. Why is it important? Simply because the vision is the desired outcome, and your vision will guide all your creative efforts now and in the future. How do you define it? Start by asking some questions: Why am I involved in this project? What do I want to achieve in the long run? What will be the ideal result of this project? Answering these simple questions will lead you to a definition of your vision. Don't forget to engage your team members in the process, too!; , Now that you've defined your vision, share it with your teammates. Meet with them to explain your team objectives. Take questions and give clear answers. Seek to avoid ambiguities and misunderstandings.  You're on a mission to eliminate/redefine the myths surrounding creativity, which is often a misunderstood commodity. Creative people exist in every field but need to be encouraged to disregard standard thinking. Creativity is a mindset, a philosophy, a way of thinking. It seeks for and applies new and useful ideas in all walks of life. Tell your people to seek the new and apply the useful.  Why reinvent the wheel if we can build something new with it? The act of creativity isn't about starting from scratch. It's about considering existing methods and creating new and improved ones. Read books, attend workshops, watch an inspiring video, or talk with leaders in your field. (If you are the leader in your field, talk to yourself. That may sound funny, but it actually could prove useful.)  , Rather like a DJ mixing songs and beats, you can mix together ideas and concepts to see if something appealing might emerge. An example is the birth of the iPhone. A mobile phone, an internet device, an iPod: a mix of three components that revolutionized the high tech industry. You can watch Steve Jobs introducing his product by clicking on the link at the end of this article.  Mixing up ideas and concepts is a good move. But not all mixes are great. You must select the best ones. To do this you'll need to evaluate the feasibility of your ideas through multiple qualitative and quantitative analyses: surveys, focus groups, experimentation. The evaluation must be brutally honest.  Your teammates have come up with a lot of good ideas, and you're very proud of them. But don't keep it to yourself! Give them a cookie, a verbal reward like "You did great today", "You have great insight" or a simple "Thank you" can increase the motivation of your people. Material rewards make nice incentives, too.  

define your vision!,  spread your vision.  redefine creativity.  learn and explore!,  mix, mix and remix!,  evaluate!,  give that man a cookie! 

 How often do you find yourself on auto-pilot, or going through the motions without really paying attention to what is going on? It is in these moments that we often allow our anxieties to grow. Mindfulness is about being aware of what is going on around you, and taking it all in. In general, people who practice mindfulness are usually less anxious.   One way to practice mindfulness is to pay attention to your breathing. Focus on your breathing and what happens to your body as you do so. Feel your chest expand and fall and take note to any differences you feel as you breathe deeply. Another way to get into mindfulness is to choose an activity in which you often go on “auto-pilot,” and take the time to notice everything around you while doing it. These simple exercises can help you to become more comfortable with mindfulness, which may make you feel better about your situation., Quieting the mind, especially when you are feeling stressed, worried, and nervous, is something that people often find extremely difficult. When you are able to, however, you often find that you feel calm and at peace with yourself. Meditation is a simple way to clear your head and help you find the peace you long for.   To start meditating, sit in a comfortable position, close your eyes, and breathe slowly. Begin by taking five minutes out of your day to do this, then gradually increase the length. When your mind begins to drift, acknowledge what you were thinking, rather than trying to kick it out of your brain, then begin to focus on your breath again.Deep breathing brings more oxygen to your brain and activates your parasympathetic nervous system. It can reverse some of the side effects of anxiety, lowering your blood pressure and slowing down your heart beat., You’ll likely find that when your body is feeling good, you’ll experience less anxiety and find peace. Therefore, you need to fuel your body with nutritious foods that support your well-being. Choose whole, real foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean sources of protein, and dairy options that are low in fat.   Stay away from fast or convenience foods. It can be tempting when you're stressed, but these foods only make you feel worse.Say "no" to sugary desserts, caffeine, alcohol, salty snacks, and drive-thru meals to feel like your best self.  When you don’t take care of your body, your mind often suffers. Combat this by exercising for at least 30 minutes every day. Doing so releases endorphins, which are nature's "feel-good" hormones that lift your mood and give you energy to face whatever comes your way.Visit your local gym to get in some cardio or strength-training. Or, simply go outside to ride a bike, go on a hike, or walk your dog around the block.  Sleep and stress work in a chicken-or-the-egg dynamic — it's hard to tell which came first. If you get little sleep, you will experience greater anxiety. If you're feeling stressed out and anxious, your sleep will be negatively affected.Counteract this by creating a sleep routine that optimizes you getting quality rest.   Avoid naps too close to bedtime. Turn off TVs, phones, and computers at least an hour before bed since the blue-light from these devices keeps you awake. Make your bedroom off-limits to other activities besides sleep or sex. And, try to go to sleep and wake at the same times every day.  A Stanford University study found that walking in nature for 90 minutes can have a positive effect on your mental health.Other studies have found that having access to nature can reduce stress, depression, and anxiety.Try taking a hike hike, going camping, rock climbing, swimming, or fishing in a lake. Practice mindfulness and allow yourself to be in the moment — take deep breaths and smell the air, notice the sounds and sights around you.  Opening up to the healing connection of nature could potentially provide further insight into your own personal experiences and how you are emotionally and cognitively affected.  

practice mindfulness.  meditate.  eat right.  exercise.  get enough sleep.  reconnect with nature. 

 Sometimes it's hard to pinpoint exactly how you are feeling when you have interest in a new person. You may want to spend a lot of time with someone, and think about them a lot, but you're not sure exactly what that means. In order to move forward, you need to understand what your feelings actually are.   You need to be able to distinguish between wanting to be friends and a sexual crush. Do you fantasize about kissing the girl or do you just want to spend a lot of time with the girl? If you simply want to spend time with the girl then you may just have a friend crush. If you want to be romantic with the girl then you probably have a sexual crush on the girl. Try writing down what is going on with you. This may help you clarify your feelings. Sometimes it can be confusing to figure out the difference between really liking a friend as a friend and having romantic feelings for a friend. Making a list of your feelings can help you figure out if you have a romantic crush or you just want to be best friends with this person. You could also discuss your feelings with a close friend. Tell them about your feelings and ask your friend why you are confused about them.; , Don't freak out!Just because you have a crush on someone of the same sex it does not make you strange. Instead, it makes you a developing young woman who is getting to know herself and her desires, which is perfectly normal.   Know that there are thousands of others out there who have had to deal with the same confusion. Many of them have figured out a solution, and so will you! This is a chance for you to explore your sexual identity. Do some reading about how sexual identity is formed and what happens when people become sexually mature. This should help calm any fears you are having because what you are feeling is perfectly normal.  Don't try to fight your natural desires. Instead, accept them and embrace them with pride. It's important to be true to yourself!   If you feel like you might potentially be a lesbian or bisexual, consider finding a place in the LGBT community. These are the people who will understand your feelings and give you the support you need. Consider joining a gay-straight alliance at your school or going to a teen group at your local LGBT center. You can even find community online, in forums such as those on emptyclosets.com.  It can be hard to come to grips with a same-sex attraction yourself, let alone letting others know about it. However, willing your feelings to go away or deciding to never let anyone know about them will not make them go away.   In fact, hiding who you really are can really impact your relationships and not allow you to fully enjoy the relationships you have with those you love. This doesn't mean that you need to shout about your crush from the rooftops. It just means that you shouldn't keep your crush a total secret. Keeping it a secret implies that there is something wrong with it, which there isn't. If you are hesitant to let a lot of people know, pick a friend to confide in and tell him or her about your feelings. If you think it might be dangerous for you to tell your family or friends that you have same-sex feelings, find a trusted adult or counselor to confide in to get advice. You should always put your safety first.  Get to know her if you don't know her already.If you have a mutual friend, ask your friend to introduce you to each other. If you don't, find a way to introduce yourself. For example, if she is reading a book you have never read, ask her about it casually. Or if you have a class together but have never talked, strike up a conversation about the class. Basically, find a entry into conversation and try to engage her.   If you do know her already, learn more about her. This is a great opportunity to think about whether you really like her romantically or not. This may also give you a chance to learn whether she's open to a same-sex relationship.  It's important to express how you feel honestly and clearly. Perhaps start the conversation by saying, "I have really enjoyed getting to know you" or "I really love spending time with you." Then tell her that you are interested in her romantically.   This can be a really hard conversation to have. It may also take a while to build up to this kind of conversation. Make sure that your friendship is on solid ground before trying to take it to the next level. Don't rush it! Take your time and decide when the time is right. If she is sidetracked or in a bad mood, choose a different time to bring up your feelings.  This can be hard to do, especially if you have a really big crush. However, it is a good idea to be prepared for rejection while at the same time being confident that she may go out with you. This is a balancing act that is important when asking anyone out!   The worst case scenario is that she insults you, puts you down, or makes fun of you. If this happens, don't let it get to you. She obviously is not the type of person you should be in a relationship with.Just know that if this girl doesn't share your feelings it's not the end of the world. There are plenty of other people, men and women, out there for you. If she says no, stay calm. It may be your first instinct to feel hurt and alone. Try to remember to be proud, not ashamed, of your feelings. Be aware that a girl that doesn't return your feelings may tell others about your same-sex attraction. Just be prepared to be outed before you take the plunge with this girl., If the girl you desire seems open to your advances, whether it is hesitantly or not, make a plan to hang out with her. Don't just tell her you like her and leave the conversation at that. You can ask her to hang out or to go on a proper date. Either way, you don't want to have an opening and not take it!   Going to dinner and the movies is a classic first date. You can get to know each other better during dinner but then you can relax while watching the movie. A first date can actually consist of a variety of different activities. Pick something that you know she likes to do. It doesn't have to be super fancy or expensive. It could just be taking a walk in nature or going to the mall together. Whatever she likes, give it a try!  , If you ask a girl out, especially if you go to the same school, means that your attraction may become public knowledge. You need to understand this and mentally prepare for this to happen if you want to act on your crush.   Think about who is important to you and if those people should hear about your feelings from you rather than from someone else. It can be a hard conversation to have but that can be better than someone hearing it through the grape vine. Coming out doesn't mean that you have to tell everyone or that you have to choose a definite sexual orientation for yourself. For example, you can start simply by telling your best friend that you have this crush and you are not sure what it means about your sexual orientation. Coming out in an area, or in a family, that is not gay friendly can be really difficult. You do need to balance your desire to be your authentic self with concerns for your safety and well being. Above all, make the decision that is right for you!  , Your family may not jump for joy that you have a same-sex attraction. It would be so great if they did but most families need an adjustment period before they can embrace this kind of attraction. In order to deal with an unsupportive family you will need to be plan how you tell them and prepare for gradual acceptance instead of immediate excitement.   You know your family best, so pick a time when your family members are in a good mood and are open to having a serious conversation. Try to stay calm. Getting upset and yelling at your family that they don't understand won't make them more likely to understand. What will make them more likely to understand is information. Gradually teaching them about the naturalness of same-sex attraction will change their minds more than getting mad and yelling at them.Don't expect the impossible. Some family members will probably always be homophobic. This is very sad but true. Instead, have low and gradual expectations for those that are very, very homophobic to begin with. That way you may be pleasantly surprised at progress instead of disappointed at lack of progress.  Not all the resistance you feel may be coming from the outside. It can be hard to come to terms with having a same-sex attraction if you have been told all your life that it is wrong. In order to deal with internalized homophobia you will need to be very honest with yourself about your feelings and work on accepting them as wonderful and natural.   Fighting internalized homophobia is hard and it may take even longer than making your family accept your feelings. Just remember, however, that the end goal of self love and happiness is worth the effort it will take to wipe the bad feelings out of your head. Fighting conflicted feelings may take more than just willing yourself to do it. In many cases is takes a professional, whether it be a counselor, therapist, or other mental health specialist, to help you work through your feelings. These people can help you identify where your negative feelings are rooted and how to eliminate them gradually. Coming to terms with a same-sex attraction can be particularly hard if you continue to be involved with people who do not support your feelings, for example if you continue to be involved in a church that doesn't support same-sex attraction. In this situation you need to make a decision about what is best for you personally. If continued involvement is important to you, then you need to take steps to make sure that what is said about same-sex attraction doesn't hurt you. This could mean a variety of things, from walking away when negative things are said to talking to a therapist about this conflict.  

assess your feelings.  know that these feelings are normal.  accept your feelings.  don't hide these feelings forever.  become friends with your crush.  tell her how you feel.  accept that she may not return your feelings.  plan a date.  decide whether to come out.  cope with an unsupportive family.  deal with conflicted feelings. 

 When describing a ring, it helps to know how professional jewelers refer to each part.The band refers to the portion of the ring that actually wraps around your finger. The shank can refer to the band as a whole, but it more commonly refers to the portions of the ring that sit on either side of a gemstone. The gallery is the underside of the band and is the portion that actually sits on top of the finger.; , Ring bands can be made from a variety of base metals, but gold, platinum, silver, tungsten carbide, titanium, and palladium are the most common options.Gold bands are classic and available in multiple colors. Yellow gold is the purest and most traditional. White gold is created when yellow gold is plated with rhodium, and rose gold is created when a copper alloy is mixed into the metal. Purity is indicated by karat size. Larger karats indicate greater purity. Platinum is almost always 95 percent pure. It is a white metal that is very durable, heavy, and naturally hypoallergenic. Silver is a white-gray metal that is very soft and weak against damage, so it tends to be an inexpensive choice. It is more commonly used in fashion rings than in engagement or wedding rings. Tungsten carbide is gray metal made from tungsten and carbon. It is very hard, heavy, and durable. Even though it retains is luster, it cannot be cut and re-soldered due to its durability, so bands made with it cannot be re-sized. Titanium has a naturally gray finish but is sometimes polished black. It is as strong as steel but as light as aluminum and is a popular choice for men's rings. The metal is also hypoallergenic. Palladium is silver-white in color. It does not tarnish and is both hypoallergenic and flexible. Rings may also use recycled materials. Recycled metal can come from a variety of sources and will take on the traits of its dominant metal., A ring may include special designs or other features that are not common enough to categorize. Even though there is no way to categorize these characteristics, you should still describe them when describing the ring.   Metalwork designs are a common example of such characteristics. For example, the band might be designed to mimic the shape of leaves, or there might be a carefully crafted wire flower centered in place over an otherwise simple band. Another special feature worth mentioning might be an engraving. Most engravings are personal in nature. They can either be placed on the gallery of the ring or on the top surface of the band.  Some rings consist of nothing more than a solid metal band. Others include one or more gemstones. The latter must be described in further detail since you'll need to elaborate on the gemstone type, quality, and placement.  The setting style of a ring refers to the placement of gemstones along the ring. There are many different settings to choose from.The channel setting has two metal tracks with a row of tiny gemstones in between. The bezel setting places a single gemstone within a thin, flat piece of protective metal. With a pave setting, one large stone sits at the center of the band while the rest of the band is covered by many small stones. In a prong setting, thin metal "claws" extend up from the band to hold a center gemstone in place. There will usually be four to six of these metal prongs. There can also be shared prong settings in which small adjacent stones share prongs with the large center stone. A cluster setting places one large gemstone at the center of the band and surrounds this gemstone with smaller outward facing gems on all sides. In a gypsy setting, the stone or stones are sunk into holes along the band of the ring. As a result, the stones are flush with the band's surface. For that reason, this can also be referred to as a “flush” setting. A tension setting is similar to a gypsy or flush setting, but the holes are more shallow and the gemstones rise about the surface of the band. Tension alone holds each stone in place. With a bar setting, small gemstones encircle the entire ring and small metal bars separate each one from the next. With an invisible setting, special grooves are cut into the band that allow the gemstones to sit securely in place without metal bars or prongs holding them up.  Identify the center gemstone. If the ring has more than one gemstone, you will need to name each one.   Diamonds are a popular gemstone, especially for engagement rings. They also happen to be the birthstone for the month of April. Cubic zirconia looks similar but is less radiant and much less expensive. Other popular birthstones include: garnet (January), amethyst (February), aquamarine (March), emerald (May), alexandrite (June), pearls (also June), ruby (July), peridot (August), sapphire (September), opal (October), tourmaline (also October), topaz (November), tanzanite (December), turquoise (also December), and zircon (also December). Additional gemstones you might find are citrine (ranging in color from yellow to orange-brown), jade (bright green), lapis lazuli (dark blue), moonstone (typically colorless), morganite (soft pinks and peaches), onyx (black), paraiba tourmaline (electric blues and greens), and spinel (bright red)., In simple terms, the cut of a stone refers to the shape of the stone. Accent stones tend to be square or round, but the center stone can come in a wide variety of cuts.The round cut or brilliant cut is the most popular shape. It features a round crown and girdle with a smaller conical base. The oval cut has a symmetrical oval crown. The princess cut is a square cut. The banquette cut looks like a narrow triangle. The triangle cut has a triangular crown. Marquise cut stones are almond-shaped or football-shaped. Pear cuts are also known as teardrop cuts. The top of the crown is pointed and the bottom is rounded. Heart shaped stones are, as the name suggests, shaped like hearts. The emerald cut looks like a tall rectangle with cut corners. The radiant cut is a blend between the emerald and brilliant cuts. The outer shape looks like an emerald cut but faces are strategically placed to refract light like a brilliant cut would. Trillion or trilliant cuts look like triangles with curved sides.  The carat is the standard unit of measurement used to weigh gemstones. A larger carat size indicates a larger stone.   One carat equals 200 milligrams.Gemstones can also be measured in size, but when describing the stone, you would usually only mention the carat weight.  Naming the type of gemstone does not adequately describe the color of the stone. Color is broken down further into three separate characteristics: hue, tone, and saturation.   The hue refers to the primary color of the stone. Some stones only come in one hue, but others are available in multiple hues. For instance, jade is always green, but moonstone can be colorless, gray, brown, yellow, green, or pink. Tone simply refers to how light or dark the color of the stone appears. Saturation is the intensity of color. Stones with bright, vivid colors are more saturated than stones with a light tint of color.  Gemstone clarity essentially refers to the amount of inclusions contained within the stone. Stones with fewer inclusions have greater clarity.   Inclusions are cracks and cuts that are visible from inside the stone. Some accidental inclusions decrease the value of a stone while carefully crafted inclusions can increase its value. Certain gemstone types are more likely to have inclusions than others.  Oftentimes, rings are purchased with a specific meaning or purpose in mind. You would usually label such a ring by it intended purpose without giving the matter a second thought.   Engagement rings and wedding rings are the most obvious examples. Birthstone rings might be given as a special gift for someone's birthday. Class rings are usually worn to acknowledge and celebrate one's high school or college graduation class.  When describing your ring, you may also indicate the size of the ring. Sizes are based on the diameter of the ring band.   Adult ring sizes usually range from size 4.5 to size 13.Size 4.5 rings are 0.58 inches (14.8 mm). Size 5 rings are 0.61 inches (15.6 mm). Size 6 rings are 0.65 inches (16.45 mm). Size 7 rings are 0.68 inches (17.3 mm). Size 8 rings are 0.72 inches (18.2 mm). Size 9 rings are 0.75 inches (19 mm). Size 10 rings are 0.78 inches (19.9 mm). Size 11 rings are 0.81 inches (20.6 mm). Size 12 rings are 0.84 inches (21.4 mm). Size 13 rings are 0.87 inches (22.2 mm).  Most rings stand alone, but some rings are sold in sets. Each ring in the set may look slightly different, but the overall design of all rings in the set will share some similarities.   Engagement rings are sometimes sold in sets with wedding bands. Simple fashion rings may also be purchased in sets, but this is slightly less common.  Including the cost of the ring in your description is not often necessary, but there are times when the circumstances may warrant it.   Always state the price in clear terms if you are describing a ring you want to sell. Mention the price if you are debating whether or not to purchase a ring and are describing it to someone who may help you reach that decision. Typically, you would not mention the price of a ring you already own when you are only describing it to friends or acquaintances.  

know how to refer to the various parts.  identify the metal.  note any distinctive characteristics.  state whether or not it includes gemstones.  describe the setting style.  name the gemstones.  specify the cut of the center gemstone.  note the carat weight.  indicate the gemstone color.  describe the clarity of the gemstone.  note the purpose.  indicate the size.  state whether or not it comes as a set.  consider stating the price. 

 With a knife and cutting board, dice up two cloves of garlic. Make sure that you chop the garlic very finely. You do not want large chunks of garlic in your dressing.For a less intense flavor, you might consider using shallots.  In a medium-sized bowl, combine all of the ingredients. Then whisk them together. Make sure that you combine the oil and vinegar thoroughly. Taste the dressing and add more salt and pepper if needed., Lightly pour some of the dressing on your leafy salad. This dressing pairs well with most leafy greens, particularly kale or arugula. In addition, apple slices and fresh walnuts also go well with the dressing., After whisking everything together, let the marinade sit for about thirty minutes, stirring occasionally. Once it is set, add your meats and veggies and let it marinate for a few hours. You can leave it all in the same bowl that you mixed it in and simply cover it up, or you can place the meat, veggies, and marinade in a large freezer bag. Finally, cook the meat and veggies.  With marinades, you can substitute apple cider vinegar for wine or balsamic vinegar. It balances out the savory flavors of the meats and vegetables with a hint of tang and sweetness.  If you want to add some extra flavor to your marinade, consider including some additional ingredients. These can be things like Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, hot sauce, red pepper flakes, onion flakes, or garlic powder. Particularly with chicken and pork, these ingredients will make the meat more flavorful. 

chop up the garlic.  whisk the ingredients together.  drizzle on salad.  marinate meat and vegetables.  make a more complex marinade. 

 The trim should reflect your own preferences and match the sheets and style of bedding. You can use braid, ribbon, fabric strips, trimmings, lace, etc. Keep in mind to keep in budget! When purchasing trim, have the sheet measurements with you and allow an extra 5 centimeter (2.0 in) each end for each edging.; , Leave 1 centimeter (0.4 in) allowance at each end to turn the raw edges of the trim under the sheet ends. Do the same for the pillowcase ruffs.  This is the "design" part. If you are adding more than one piece of trim (for example, you might be making a row of different trims, work out the pattern placement. Be sure to check that this fits alongside the sheet edge or pillowcase ruff.  Make sure that you tuck the raw edges under and pin them into place as well.  Keep all pieces well aligned and ensure that they are joining one another evenly.  Cut off any excess threads.  

find suitable trim.  cut each trim to measure the width of the sheet.  decide how you want your trim to appear.  pin the edges into place.  machine stitch along both sides of each piece of trim as close the edge as possible.  finish off by sewing the raw edges into place. 

 Cut the soap base into ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeter) pieces. This will help the soap melt faster and more evenly.Some types of melt-and-pour soap bases have cutting guidelines, which you can use. Make sure that you are using the melt-and-pour type of soap base, as regular bars of soap from the store won't melt. You can find melt-and-pour soap bases in the craft store and online.   You can also use 12 ounces (340.2 grams) of white glycerin melt-and-pour soap base instead.Melt-and-pour soap is a great way to get started in soap making because you won't be working with lye, which can be dangerous.; , There are two ways you can do this: in a double-boiler on the stove or in a glass container the microwave. Choose the method that works the best for you, then remove the soap from heat. Keep it in the container you melted it in.   Stove: Assemble a double-boiler. turn the heat on to low. Add the soap to the top bowl. Allow the soap to melt most of the way, stirring occasionally. Take the pot off the stove, then let the soap finish melting.Microwave: heat the soap for 30 seconds. Give it a stir, then heat it for 10 seconds. Stir it once more, then continue heating and stirring at 5 second intervals until the soap has melted., Be sure to scrape the bottom of the pot while you stir. This will help keep things from settling on the bottom., This is not absolutely necessary, but it will help make the soap more nourishing., Stir them in with a spoon until the color of the soap is consistent and no streaks remain. You don't have to add the dye in, but it will help make your soap more pink and reminiscent of calamine lotion.You can also leave out the dye if you prefer.   Make sure that you are using soap making dye. Candle dye and fabric dye are not skin safe, and food coloring can stain.  Once again, you don't have to do this, but it can make the soap smell nicer. Use a calming fragrance, such as rose or lavender. If this is for a kid, try something associated with the color pink, such as bubblegum or cotton candy.Make sure that fragrance oils meant for soap making. The kind used for making candles are not considered to be skin-safe.You can try using essential oil instead of fragrance oil. Make sure that it is skin-safe as not all essential oils are.  You can use a round or square PVC mold. You can also use individual soap molds as well. If you use a round or square mold, you will need to slice the soap into smaller bars after it dries.For a more unique mold, cut off the bottom 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) of six water bottles, and use that instead.If the mixture forms bubbles, spray the surface with rubbing alcohol. This will make the bubbles disappear., This will take 30 minutes if you are using several small molds. It may take up to several hours if you are using one big mold., Simply turn the mold over, and pop the soap out. You may have to wiggle the sides to loosen the soap. If you used a large mold, such as a round or square PVC mold, you will need to slice the soap into smaller bars. You should be able to make 3 to 4 bars.Once you pop the soap out of the molds, it is ready to use!   If you used plastic water bottles as molds, you'll need to cut the bottles apart with a craft blade, then slide the soap out. 

cut or break apart 12 ounces (340.2 grams) of goats milk melt-and-pour soap base.  melt the soap in a double-boiler or in the microwave.  stir 2 tablespoons of calamine lotion into the melted soap.  break apart 5 vitamin e oil capsules and add them to the soap.  add 2 drops of red soap making dye, if desired.  add 0.25 to 0.5 ounce (7.5 to 14.8 grams) of fragrance oil, if desired.  pour the soap into a soap making mold.  allow the soap to cool and dry.  de-mold the soap. 

  If you do not possess these items, you can find these items easily in most department stores or pharmacies, Simply dampen the swab in the rubbing alcohol. Make sure to only apply a light amount, Take the now damp cotton swap and insert it into the insertion gap. Once inside, wipe around the copper contacts in a rectangular motion.   Be careful, but also be firm with your cleaning. Repeat this step (making sure to replace your swab each time) until you do not see any dirt on your swab  ,, Air drying is the best recommendation. It should take no more than 5-10 minutes. 

acquire the cotton swabs and alcohol.  dampen cotton swab in alcohol.  wipe around copper contacts with alcohol covered cotton swab.inspect cartridge for debris.  allow cartridge to dry before you try it. 

 Whether you live together or not, spending time apart is necessary for maintaining your independence within any relationship.If you can’t stand to be away from each other for a few days, you are probably too dependent on each other for your own happiness and feelings of self-worth. Remind yourself that you are a valuable person and you don't need someone else to give your life meaning.Try saying something like, "I am a valuable person and having alone time is healthy for me." Being apart gives you a chance to miss your partner, and that reminds you how important they are to you. If you are never apart, you might start taking the little things that you love about each other for granted., If you find yourself obsessing over what your significant other is doing without you—whether it’s something as small as watching an episode of a show you usually watch together, or being unfaithful—you might be masking your own fears of abandonment or getting hurt. Redirect your thoughts to what you can control: how you are spending your time.   It’s natural to worry sometimes, but being preoccupied with these thoughts is a sign of attachment anxiety. People with this problem expect the worst behavior from their partners or are always waiting for the relationship to end., If you are too far away to see each other in person, scheduling a time to talk on the phone with your significant other can give you something to look forward to. It’s also a chance to connect with each other while you are apart, and have a real conversation.   Make sure not to call or text too often. Evaluate your relationship, how long you will be apart, and how often you usually talk or see each other.If you know your significant other is busy, send a personal message through email or Facebook instead of texting, or call your significant other's voicemail directly and leave a sweet message. These forms of communication won’t interrupt your significant other while at work or a family event, and will be a nice surprise. Try to set up a special time for each other, such as watching a favorite show at the same time while your significant other is away. You'll feel closer knowing your significant other is watching the same thing as you, it will also give you both something to discuss other than how much you're missing each other.  When you do get to see each other, and even when you are able to talk on the phone or through an internet video call, make sure you aren’t always doing/saying the same things. Plan different types of activities for date nights. Talk about new topics you haven’t discussed before, or want to use to learn more about each other.If your conversations become stagnant, bring up a news item or interesting topic you’ve recently heard. Talk about your childhood. What did you want to be when you grew up; what was your favorite fun activity as a kid; what was your favorite Halloween costume ever? Look in local newspapers or on websites for ideas about new activities to try. Ask friends and co-workers who have significant others what they do together for more ideas.  Include new activities you have never done as a couple or have talked about trying. Or, plan your day together on your own as a surprise and include something your significant other has always wanted to do. Use your imagination! Consider planning a whole day around one theme, like a romantic movie (When Harry Met Sally), or a pretend visit to Paris.   Get croissants and sit at an outside café for a couple hours, walk across the prettiest bridge near you, and visit your city’s art museum. Visit a public garden for a picnic lunch, stop by a plant store on the way home to pick out a few of the flowers you saw earlier, and plant them together when you get home. Stick to a “water” theme and schedule a visit to an aquarium or science museum, find the biggest public fountain in town and bring some change to make wishes together (make sure it is allowed first!), and end the day with a walk along a nearby canal or beach. Plan a scavenger hunt to do together. Write clues that will take you to different places that remind you of each other or surprises you know they would love.  The best way to cope with separation and keep your relationship strong is to communicate with each other about your feelings. When you talk, tell your significant other that you miss him or her. Ask about what your significant other is doing and tell your significant other about your day to feel more connected. Remind your significant other how grateful you are that he or she is a part of your life.  

accept that spending time apart is healthy.  stop worrying about what your significant other is doing.  call or do a video chat.  keep your relationship fresh.  plan a special activity.  tell your significant other that you love and miss him or her. 

 Developing your own tea brand is one way to start your own tea business. This will involve you buying unpackaged tea leaves from suppliers and developing your own packaging and branding for your distinct product. There are a number There are also long-established brands in traditional tea drinking countries such as the UK.Research these brands and determine what makes them successful. Some market tea as a healthy option. When you do this research look for gaps in the market or ideas that nobody has thought of yet.; , While you are doing research on the existing brands you should be trying to formulate a clear vision of what will distinguish your own brand of tea. It's essential to have clarity of purpose to help drive you through difficult times. Maybe you will present your tea as a healthy alternative to sugary drinks, or a tasty and perhaps slightly exotic drink that you can have throughout the day as an alternative to coffee.   Once you have this clear vision you need to find the place in the market to pitch your product, and the customers you want to target. You need to be able to confidently express the distinct features of your brand., An essential part of any new business is the establishment of a clear and focused business plan. This plots the core values and identity of your business as well as mapping your plan for growth and success. Typically a business plan should begin with an executive summary, and then a company summary. There are helpful online tools to help you build your business plan to a basic template, and give you examples to follow.The following should be covered in your plan:   Products and services. This section details what your business will be selling, what your products are and your reasoning. Market analysis summary. Here you will record you market research and clearly identify the area in the market where you will push your product. Strategy and implementation summary. This section should give a clear outline of how you will develop your business. Start with getting your goods to market and then detail your plans for growth with a clear timeline and objectives. Management summary. This section will give details on how the business will be run, what your management style will be and how this will affect the business culture and operations. Financial plan. Finally, you will need to give detailed information about the finances. Provide a full breakdown of costs and revenues. Mark break-even points and when you will turn a profit., You can buy leaf loose, or in prepared tea bags. It's likely that you will sell it as you receive it, just re-packaged, so bear this in mind. Decanting loose tea leaves into individual tea bags would be very time consuming, but if you are going for a homemade look and feel it could be a good choice. Make sure you know exactly what you are getting and ask for samples before committing to orders.   Search online at first to get a basic idea of suppliers globally and those operating in your locality. Some online databases can be useful first points of call.Think about environmentally friendly and sustainably produced tea leaves which can become a part of your brand identity as well as being an ethical way to do business. Go to trade shows, read trade publications and ask around people in the industry. This kind of specialist knowledge and experience can be invaluable., Once you have a clear supply route planned out you need to move on the next phase of your product development, namely designing the packaging and branding artwork. You may choose to hire someone with expertise in graphic and product design to help with this. It will probably have to be produced on a computer and be of high quality for any manufacturer to produce it for you.   Remember in the early stages you need to start small, so get a small run for samples and promotions first. The packaging will be the main way people identify your brand so think about this very carefully. Consider running some focus groups with people you can trust to give you honest feedback. Think about function as well as form. Do some research online and ask for advice from professional designers., When you have drawn up the plan for your brand, it can be helpful to produce a sample box or two. You will need to get the tea you want to sell and package it as you like. Once you have this you can use it to promote your tea business in local stores and tea rooms to gauge interest and develop contacts before you put in any big orders with suppliers.   A prototype product enables you to test it for durability as well as get a proper impression of how it looks and functions. Having a prototype will make people take you more seriously. Your product is becoming a physical reality rather than just an idea. Being able to hold and use something makes a big difference., Once you have a clear picture of the brand you want to create you need to decide how you will sell your tea. Will you be an online only business, taking orders and shipping tea across the world? Maybe you will try to sell to local tea rooms and stores. Or perhaps both! How you sell is the major part of your business so it's important you consider this fully and have a clear plan and target audience.   It is relatively easy to create a website, but there are already a large number of online tea stores so you need to think about how you will stand out. If you plan to sell face-to-face locally, ensure you survey demand in interest in advance. Visit some local tea rooms and shops and ask if they are interesting in getting a new supplier. And bring your samples!  , This can be a complicated area so it's a good idea to consult an expert in small business start-ups to ensure all the bureaucracy is properly taken care of.   You will need to officially register your business name, as well as registering with local state agencies. In the US you can do this through the government's Small Business Administration., Once you are ready to sell you need to begin marketing your tea. Your marketing plan should have taken shape when you were drawing up your business plan, and now it's time to put this into action. Try to market your brand in a way that speaks to your desired brand identity. You will need to consider how you will reach your audience and distinguish yourself from the competition.   Using an social media campaign can be effective way to set yourself out from other older tea brands. Having a strong and consistent social media presence for your brand can help you to establish a distinct identity and foothold. You can consider including recipes and facts about tea to broaden your output. 

evaluate existing brands.  have a clear picture of your tea brand.  draw up your business plan.  find your tea leaf suppliers.  design and order your packaging.  create a sample box of tea.  decide how you will sell your tea.  register your business.before you start business you need to ensure you have completed all the legal and regulatory requirements in your area.  market your tea online and in person. 

 Avoid the use of a detergent, as this can damage the hair cuticle further. Maximize your use of protein sources to provide polymers to help repair damaged hair fibers. Consider using avocados and eggs as thickeners and polymer sources. Use mild emollients like shea butter or coconut oil.  Make sure your ingredients are blending well. If you are using an emollient that is solid at room temperature, warm it up first. Add your thickeners, scents, and any additional botanicals you would like to add to the conditioner.  Add vinegar or soapy water drop by drop to acidify or basify the conditioner. Use pH paper to measure the pH of the conditioner. Make sure it falls within an acceptable range of 5.5 to 7, trying to hew closer to neutral.  Spread it evenly throughout your damp, untangled hair, from your tips toward your roots. Cover your head, and let it sit for approximately 20 minutes. Heating the conditioner can help spread it and help compounds in the conditioner bond with your hair.  This conditioner should reduce damage to the hair cuticle or make some effect toward repairing it, reducing frizz, improving overall manageability, and produce smoother, more resilient hair. Repeat the treatment if you’d like.  Store it in the refrigerator or freezer for a day or two because these are highly perishable ingredients. Rubbing rancid fat or spoiled produce through your hair will accomplish nothing good. Multiple conditionings in a few days are unlikely to be needed, unless you wash your hair every day.  

gather your ingredients.  blend your ingredients in water using a blender or food processor.  adjust the ph of your conditioner.  apply the conditioner.  rinse thoroughly.  store or dispose of excess conditioner. 

   Keep a journal of your medical problems and treatments.Bring it with you when you visit a doctor. You shouldn't put off seeing a doctor for something that might be serious to work on the journal, but the journal will help you remember the details of what to tell the doctor about all of your problems and help you keep track of them for more effective follow-up. In one section, or, if you prefer, a section for each problem, keep a diary of each of your problems. Describe the problem and any changes you notice, being as detailed and precise as possible. For pain, write down how severe it was on a scale from 1 to 10 (10 being the worst possible pain you have ever experienced) and how long it lasted. For problems you can see, like a mark or lump, measure and draw or take a picture. If you try a remedy, write down what you did and how it worked. Date every entry. In another section, list your medications, the dates you began and finished taking them, the doses and frequencies, and any side-effects you may have experienced. Include anything that seems at all like a drug, including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter drugs, supplements, vitamins, and special diets. Review your journal before any doctor's appointment.  As an example, here's how to keep a "headache diary". You could keep the journal on a computer, and even have it automatically transcribed from dictation into your phone.If you're at all unsure about how to describe a drug, bring the doctor the bottle (keep the pills in it to avoid dangerous confusion).   Document your discussion. The next time you see your doctor, for whatever reason, discuss the problems in your journal. Mention the drugs, too, so the doctor can tell if any of them are inappropriate or could cause problems for a particular course of treatment. Write down the diagnosis and treatment plan in your journal. Go over these with your doctor to make sure you understand them. A separate section for doctors' advice, with each entry dated, would help you make sure to keep up with this important information.  Make a file to save any papers your doctor or other healthcare providers such as pharmacies give you, too.   Ask for more time. When making the appointment with the doctor, let the office know if you have lots to discuss with the doctor and to give you a longer time-slot. This shouldn’t require bigger co-pay, but does give them a heads-up for scheduling, so you can be sure to get all of the issues at hand discussed.  With so much to discuss, your doctor will surely appreciate your being on time. Try to arrive early.  ; , During your time with the doctor, tell him if any medications you take may need refilling soon, and ask if they have samples. Sometimes the doctor will have free promotional samples for you.  Often a drug is available in generic form (the same drug, from a different maker) at low cost, or there is a less expensive substitute available (which could be less expensive for reasons having nothing to do with its effectiveness, or not relevant to your particular problem). These generally don't come with slick promotional materials or samples, but with the savings you won't mind.  When scheduling a well check-up that requires labs, have the doctor’s office send you the lab slip so you can go in the week before (or when they advise) to have the lab samples taken. By the time you see the doctor the results should be ready to consider at that visit.  Health insurance provides peace of mind by covering most medical expenses that may come up. But adverse selectionand moral hazard, can make individual health insurance, in particular, very expensive. Perhaps as importantly - or more importantly for routine care - health insurance companies compensate for individuals' lack of bargaining powerwith healthcare providers by negotiating large discounts from often-high list prices.Though an inexpensive policy won't pay as much of your expenses as a costly one, it may reduce the amount to be paid just as well. There are also "medical discount plans"that provide discounts only, and religious associations that share medical costs on an ongoing basis without any guarantees. These arrangements are not regulated like insurance, so if you're considering one, do your research to make sure that it is what it claims to be and that it is what you want.   You can try negotiating discounts from health care providers yourself, too, upfrontor when you find you can't pay them. Governments sometimes subsidize health care for the poor. Find out if you're eligible.  

make the most of your doctor visits.  ask for samples.  ask about generic and lower-cost substitute drugs.  get a lab slip.  control prices with a health plan. 

 Direct sunlight enables more rapid algae growth. Help minimize algae proliferation by keeping your fountain in a shady or covered area.If a completely shaded area is not available, a partially shaded area may still help slow algae growth. Also consider placing a cover such as an umbrella or awning in the area near your fountain to help provide shade if no natural shade is available.; , Tap water and even filtered water still have natural impurities present in them. Distilled water has all of the impurities removed, which can help slow algae formation and prevent algae growth.For larger fountains, distilled water is likely impractical. However, adding a good filter where your fountain draws or recycles water may still help remove some impurities.  The best time to start using algae prevention products is right after you have set up or deep cleaned your fountain. Commercial products are available online as well as at home improvement and maintenance stores.If you are concerned about the health and safety of wildlife using your fountain, look for animal-safe products. Most products found in pet stores and hardware stores will be animal-safe, but it is important to check the labels. Common products include Algae Shield and SeaKlear. If wildlife is not a concern, such as with indoor fountains, a cap of bleach may also work as a preventative measure. Before applying an anti-algae agent to your fountain, check the manufacturer's instructions to make sure that the product you purchased will not damage your current fountain setup. Product instructions will vary by product, but often all you need to do is add product to the water on a regular basis to the running fountain.  Changing the water helps eliminate current living algae and prevents buildup in your fountain’s pump system. Completely empty your fountain of old water and allow it air dry before filling the fountain.If possible, rinse down your fountain and wipe away any buildup or residue from the fountain surface as well as any decorative features such as stones before refilling it.  The pump is responsible for cycling water through the fountain, reducing algae's ability to grow. Scrub the pump's parts with a sponge or a firm-bristled toothbrush and distilled water.If you need to open the pump in order to get at interior parts, follow the manufacturer's instructions. All pumps are different, and what works for one pump may not work for another.  The pump cannot function unless it is entirely underwater. Keep the pump submerged to keep water cycling through and prevent algae from building and growing on the surface.It is common to have to add water to your fountain for the first several days after setting it up in order to ensure the pump stays submerged.  Your fountain should receive a deep cleaning every two months. Turn off and drain the fountain and wipe it down with a fountain cleaning solution, which may be available from a speciality retailer or online, or dish soap.Opt for dish soap if you are looking for a product that is friendly for animals such as birds and small mammals that may make use of your fountain. Go over the fountain with a toothbrush to scrape off algae and other organic matter. Be sure to thoroughly rinse the fountain after using soap, as it may damage the fountain if left on its surface. Clean the fountain's tubes using pipe cleaners, such as can be found at any hardware or craft store, to scrub out the pipe interiors.  If you find that your fountain has developed noticeable algae, the first thing you need to do is thoroughly scrub the individual components of your fountain. Take your fountain apart and clean each surface using soap and hot water and allow to air dry before reassembling.Wipe down the fountain with distilled white vinegar or a solution of 1 cap of bleach per gallon of water before soaping and rinsing the fountain. Rinse bleach thoroughly.  Unlike preventative treatments, algaecides are meant to kill off existing algae growths within a fountain. Algaecides are available in home improvement stores as well as online and specialty retailers.Check the algaecide bottle to see how to properly use the product. Check the bottle to see how much product should be added to the water and at what frequency. Non-metallic algaecides work better in fountains as they are less likely to stain.  If heavy algae growth continues for extended periods in your fountain, consider replacing the pump to get better water movement and circulation.

 Have a conversation with your partner about each of your values around money. Often, people inherit the beliefs, values, and attitudes around money from family.Before getting into the next argument about money, sit down and talk about how your partner relates to money.   Understanding your partner's attitudes and views might explain why he or she is hesitant to discuss money, or why he or she feels the urge to overspend. Whatever your partner's relationship to money, it is important for you to understand it clearly. Ask your partner, “What did your parents or family members teach you about money? Can you remember your first memory involving money? Do you have any financial goals? Do you have any fears around money? Was your family fearful about money when you were a kid?”; , If you have thoughts such as, “We’ll finally be financially okay once he stops overspending” or, “I’ll be happy once she changes her behavior,” recognize that you’re placing your happiness onto someone else only if he or she changes. Remind yourself that you are engaging in a false belief based on your own thinking; no one can “make” you happy, and no one can “make” you feel anything. This is an opportunity for you to face your own beliefs around money and any fears you may have. Resolve to explore your own relationship to money before demanding your partner to change.Ask yourself, “What is it I want my partner to change? How does this relate to my own beliefs on money? Is there something I need to change in how I relate to money?”  , If having “enough” money is the only thing that makes you or your partner feel secure, you may find that it causes constant worry and conflict in the relationship. If you perceive your partner spending money on an unnecessary item as a threat to your relationship or a threat to your own security, it may be time to reflect on your relationship with money.Ask yourself, “What makes me feel secure? How does money play a role in me feeling secure? When do I know I have enough money? When is it okay to spend more money than expected?”  , If one partner handles the day-to-day spending and the other partner deals with long-term savings, this can cause problems in the relationship. This kind of task division can cause conflicts. If you want to handle one job at a time, consider switching roles each month by one person handling daily expenses while the other handles investments, then switching.You can also share the roles equally. Set a time each month to pay bills, discuss spending, and look over savings. Plan something fun to do together afterward, such as going to a movie or going bowling. This way, the money talk will feel less like a chore and you will have something to look forward to afterward.  If your current situation isn’t working well or causes many difficulties, approach banking in a new way. For example, you can share one bank account (used for paying bills, household expenses, groceries, and vacations, and cars) and then have separate accounts for your own personal spending. Be creative in finding an approach that works for you and that minimizes conflict., When you first fall in love, you may throw caution to the wind and spend money on special experiences together. Yet, before you know it, you may run out of money which can lead to conflict. Find a realistic way to budget that both of you agree upon. You may work with a financial planner, create a budget on your own, or use an online/smartphone application to track your spending.While nobody likes to budget, it can be helpful to track your spending for a month to see where the money goes. After that month, see your “money pits” and figure out a plan to spend money more meaningfully the next month. Slowly allocate your money to places you’d rather spend it.  Instead of accusing each other of bad spending habits, learn to live within your means. Don’t take out any debt that isn’t necessary. If you want a big purchase, save up for it. If you feel an impulse to buy something, tell yourself to wait one day (or one week) before you buy it. Make it a goal not to fall into debt.By living within your means, you can avoid future problems that could threaten your relationship.   If you are in debt, you may want the advice of a financial planner. Make it a priority to get out of debt as fast as you can. For more information, check out How to Get Out of Debt.  If you have problems with your credit, you may consider seeing a credit counselor. You can find help for managing debt and creating a budget. You may also enroll in a debt management program (DMP), which can help you manage your debts. Some creditors will waive or lower fees. Many credit unions, universities, and military bases offer services for credit counseling.Ask what services are offered and how payments work. Some places offer payment plans.  Don’t spend money just to spite your partner or “get back” at him or her. If your relationship gets to this point, it’s likely the relationship is in a state of neglect and needs attention. Don’t use money as a weapon.Recognize that vindictive spending does not help you manage money in a positive way. Change your approach by talking about these financial decisions one-by-one, and coming to a solution together.   If your partner makes a financial decision that you do not agree with, don’t try to get revenge. Ask yourself, “What is this accomplishing? Is getting revenge helping us move forward as a couple?”  , Instead of interrupting your partner when he or she speaks, listen to everything being said. Don’t plan what to say next or think of a comeback. Just listen and wait for your turn to speak. This shows respect and can help you better understand your partner.It can also help prevent arguments by not jumping to conclusions about what your partner did or why he or she did it. Engaged listening can prevent fights by fully understanding your partner.   Look your partner in the eyes, keep your body language engaged, and asked questions. You can say, “Is there anything else you’d like to say?” before moving on. For more information, check out How to Communicate Effectively .  Perhaps a hidden expense is exposed or your partner makes a large purchase without asking you first. Your first reaction may be to blame your partner or jump on the defensive. If blame is a normal part of your interactions, recognize that casting constant blame can be abusive. If you are feeling blamed, tell your partner how you feel without pointing the blame back.Instead of blaming, use “I” statements. While blaming is often an accusation, you can learn to state your own feelings and concerns without blaming your partner.For example, instead of saying, “That purchase you made set us back and now we can’t afford our vacation,” say, “I wish you would have told me about that purchase beforehand. I’m sad that it’s affecting us now, and will affect our vacation together.”  , A psychologist or therapist can help you and your partner when your own efforts have failed. Working with a therapist can help you and your partner relate to each other better when discussing finances and break out of unhealthy patterns. Find a marriage or couple’s therapist, who specialize in working with couples in conflict.For more information, check out How to Attend Couples Counseling.  

talk to your partner about feelings related to money.  check your beliefs.  recognize whether your sense of security is tied to money.  divide financial duties differently.  try a new approach to banking.  use smart budgeting.  decide to live within your means.  go to credit counseling.  avoid vindictive spending.  listen and don’t jump to conclusions.  avoid blaming your partner.  talk to a therapist. 

 To prepare your tomato plants to be transferred outdoors, start your seedlings indoors while it is still cold outside. Cool temperatures in early spring can stunt growth or even kill young seedlings. Start your seedlings indoors to improve your production chances.  You can find these pots at your local nursery or garden supply store.  For example, one mix could be made using 1/3 peat moss, 1/3 coarse vermiculite, and 1/3 compost. Just make sure to water it before you sow your seeds.  Cover with soil and pat down lightly.  When the seeds germinate, move them into full sun or under grow lights.  When you start to see sprouts, you can water less frequently. More plants are killed by too much water (that rots the roots) than too little water so water sparingly after the plants sprout.   You can also soak the seeds flat in water, so the roots are watered from the bottom up. Misting may not get enough water to the roots.  Once the plants peek out of the soil, they will grow pretty fast. 

start tomato plants from seeds indoors 6 to 8 weeks before your last frost.  purchase plastic peat pots or similar small pots for growing seedlings.  fill your peat pot with the moistened soil mix of your choice.  sow 2 to 3 seeds 1/4-inch deep in soil in each pot.  store the containers in room of 70 to 80 °f (21 to 27 °c) until germination occurs.  mist the seeds daily for the first 7 to 10 days.  check your pots every day. 

 Before you begin, you'll need to decide what changes you need to make. In most cases you'll be removing links. If the watch is only slightly loose, you'll probably want to leave it as-is.   If the watch is too tight, contact Casio.They may be able to send you additional links or send you a watch with an oversize band.; , By centering the face of the watch on your wrist, you'll be able to see how much extra slack you have on each side.You will want the watch to be comfortable. Some slack will keep it from pinching you, but the watch will be able to move on your arm with too much slack.  For a watch that is slightly too loose you'll want to remove one link. If it is much too loose you'll need to remove two or more.  You will want to get a small nail with a long tip and a high quality, precision flat head screwdriver. The head of the screwdriver will ideally be under 2mm wide. If you have a jeweler's screwdriver, it would be ideal.   You may also find it helpful to work over a soft, smooth, and clean surface. A white towel or tee shirt works well.That way if you drop your nail or any of the small parts of the watch they'll be safe and easy to find.  Don't try to remove a link that doesn't have arrows on the underside. The links with arrows are removable links.You'll notice that the removable links aren't near the edges of the band. Also, remember that you want the watch to be centered on your wrist, so you'll need to take links from both sides of the band if you are taking more than one out.  You'll see a small hole on one side of the band. While firmly gripping the watch, tap on the nail head until you see a small peg poke out of the other side of the band. You will also a niche exposed under the arrow.   If you look closely, one end of the pins is solid and the other has a faint line through it. You want to tap the solid side. When tapping the solid side you should only need to push it about a quarter of an inch before it slides out.  Gently start sliding the pin down.The pin will usually drop out easily, but if it does not you can use needle-nosed pliers to withdraw it. Catch the pin and gently remove the link if it does not fall off on its own. , Carefully align the remaining links. Once the links are aligned, reinsert the pin to close the loop of the band.If you were going to be removing multiple links, proceed with a link from the other side of the watch band.  Try on your watch! If it is still too loose, remove another link. If it is too tight, replace a link. Congratulations. You are now looking sharp with a properly sized Casio on your wrist.  

put your watch on.  center the watch on your wrist.  decide how many links you need to remove.you can do this using a tape measure if you'd like, but estimating usually works better.  remove the watch and ready your tools.  find the links with arrows.  choose your link pin and place the nail.  put the screwdriver in the small niche.  save the link and the pin.now that you have successfully removed your link(s), you will want to be sure to set them aside, in case you have removed too many links and the watch is now too small.  ,  reattach the band.  test the fit. 

 When your convertible top is down, it is folded up tightly in the deck of the vehicle. For a well-conditioned top, this isn’t an issue, but if you leave the top folded for too long, it may result in defined fold lines or even cracks developing in the convertible top’s material.Always put the top up before storing your vehicle or parking it for the night. It can be impossible to remove lines or cracks in the top without replacing the convertible top itself.  Whether your convertible folds up automatically or manually, it can be damaged if it is folded onto something. Always make sure the area the top folds into is clear of obstructions and that there is nothing stored in the top’s compartment, otherwise the material of the top or the metal frame for it could be damaged.Check the top’s compartment to ensure nothing has fallen into it before folding the top down. Make sure nothing is resting on top of the convertible top while it is folded as well.  Some convertible tops come equipped with vinyl windows. These windows can yellow over time due to exposure to sunlight and accumulating dirt, so use a high quality vinyl cleaner on rear windows if they aren’t made of glass.You can determine if your top is made of glass or vinyl by seeing if it bends. A glass window will not bend. If your top is also made of vinyl, you may use the same vinyl cleaner to clean the window.  If your vinyl window has already yellowed, you can purchase a vinyl lens glaze product at most auto parts stores. These cleaners spray onto the vinyl and remove the yellowing, making the window clear once again.Poorly maintained vinyl windows can reduce visibility out of the back of the vehicle. If your vinyl window is too dark to see though, you may need to have it replaced by a professional.  

do not leave the top down overnight.  check to make sure the deck is clear when putting the top down.  treat vinyl windows with a cleaner and protectant.  reduce yellowing of glazing on vinyl windows with a lens glaze. 

 Splash a shot of bourbon, rum, or whiskey in the eggnog when you blend it. Add as much or as little as you want.  If you choose to do this, simply add the rest of your ingredient to the mixture without straining it.   Alternately, you could strain the pulp out, then add a portion of it back to the mixture after straining it out. For instance, if you want your nog just a bit thicker, you could scoop a table spoon or two of the strained nuts when blending the mix for the final time.  This will reduce the thickness of the nog.   You could also add ice to your cup before pouring yourself a glass. As the ice melts, it will add water to the beverage, making it thinner.  Cashew and almond milk are readily available in grocery stores. If you’re impatient or just too busy to make your own milk alternative, you could buy one at your local grocery store. You could also use soy milk, though the higher fat content in cashew milk and almond milk make them more appropriate for eggnog.   You could also save time by using vanilla extract instead of vanilla bean.One teaspoon per two to three cups of water should be enough.  These adjustments can change the flavor profile of your tasty nog.   Pecans are sweeter than walnuts, and have a more mild taste. Walnuts have a rich flavor and blend well.  Toss half a frozen banana into the mix before blending everything to give the nog a fruity flavor. You could also play with the spice content of the nog by adding or removing nutmeg, cinnamon, or pumpkin spice.Alternately (or additionally), you could add a tablespoon or two of maple syrup to the blend. 

make a boozy eggnog.if you are of legal drinking age, you could give your eggnog a kick.  thicken your eggnog.if you like a richer, fattier eggnog, you could leave the nut pulp in the eggnog after blending the nuts and water.  make a thinner eggnog.if the eggnog is too thick for your tastes, add a few extra tablespoons of water before blending it for the final time.  take the lazy way.  use different nuts.instead of almonds or cashews, try raw, unsalted pecans or walnuts.  add a sweet note to your nog. 

 The content of an HTML form must be typed within the <form> and </form> tags. These tags act as a container for your form, like other container tags like <div></div> and <table></table>You can use CSS or HTML inside the <form></form> tags to make your form look the way you want.; , To start your form, scroll to the location in your file where the form should begin and type <form> on its own line. This tag signifies the beginning of your form.  This tells the <form> tag what to do with the form data. You’ll define this by adding action=”path_to_script” to the <form> tag.   For example: <form action=”/cgi-bin/myformscript.pl”> (if the script that will parse the form data is located in a directory on your server called “cgi-bin”). If the script is on another server: <form action=”https:  To send the form data to an email address (not a script):<form action=”mailto:you@yourdomain.com” enctype=”text/plain”>   , Now that you’ve defined where the form data will be sent, you must decide whether your form will “GET” or “POST” the data. Then, you will add either “GET” or “POST” as the method attribute inside the <form> tag.Use method=”get” to request data from a resource. You should only use GET to retrieve data. Never use GET with sensitive information like passwords or social security numbers. Use method=”post” to submit data to be processed. Use this if the form data is sensitive, such as for passwords or credit card numbers. The end result should follow this format: <form action=”/cgi-bin/myformscript.pl” method=”post”>   , You can add a blank box in which your visitors can type their names, comments, or anything else you may need. Start this on a new line after the <form> tag.   For example, First Name: <input type=”text” id=”name” /> creates a text box prefaced by “First Name:” so users know what to type into the box. Change the “id=” value (“name” in the example) to match what you’re doing with the data. If the data is sent to a script, this value should correspond with something in the script.  If your script calls for a user to enter a password, you’ll add another <input />, this time with the “type” attribute set to “password.”   On a new line, type Password: <input type=”password” name=”password” />   , If you’d like visitors to choose from a list of items, create a list of options with radio buttons. To do this, you’ll use the <input /> tag with the “type” attribute set to “radio”.   To create a radio buttons to select either “Dog” or “Cat”:  <input type=”radio” name=”pets” value=”dog” /> Dog <input type=”radio” name=”pets” value=”cat” /> Cat   A group of radio buttons should all have the same “name” attribute.  There are so many types of inputs and lists you can include in your form. A great way to expand your HTML form knowledge is to browse W3school’s HTML Forms site. Additionally, there are many helpful wikiHows articles to walk you through setting up items like selectable lists, reset/clear buttons, and check boxes.  Once your visitor fills out the form, they’ll need to submit it by clicking a submit button. Here’s an example:<button type="submit">Send your message</button> Replace “Send your message” with the text you want to appear on the button.  This tag indicates that the form is over. Remember, all form content must be inside <form> and </form>.  Now that you’ve added a form to your HTML document, upload it to your web server and give it a test run!  

open your html document in your preferred text editor.  open the <form> element.  add the “action=” attribute to the <form> tag.  decide how the form data will be sent.  create a text box using <input type=”text” />.  create a password box.  add radio buttons for options.  learn more advanced form options.  create a submit <button>.  type </form> at the end of the form.  upload your document to your web server. 

 Remove the lid from the cup, allowing the water droplets to fall into the tea. Place the lid on the table, making sure the inside faces upwards. Grip the side of the cup with one hand. Place your other hand under the cup to support it., It’s common to drink the soup instead of spooning it. Use your chopsticks or a spoon if provided to pick up solid pieces. If your soup has noodles in it, slurp while eating them. In Japan, it’s rude not to slurp since the noise signifies that you enjoy the food., Serving yourself looks bad. Pour the sake out for anyone eating with you. Let them return the favor or allow your server to do it when you are alone. Savor the drink, smelling its scent before you begin to sip it.Consider tipping your sushi chef with a shot of sake or a beer for a job well done. This is customary in Japan. Don’t ask again if the chef doesn’t accept. Get the same drink for yourself if the chef accepts. 

drink tea with one hand under the cup.  drink soup from the bowl.  pour out sake for others. 

 According to behavioral specialists, people who are lying tend to exhibit certain body language cues. Look for these body language cues to determine if your boyfriend is telling a lie. For example:He may itch his nose often and his nose may turn red. This is known as the Pinocchio Sign, as a lie causes your cells to release histamine, which can cause your nose to itch and become swollen. He may also exhibit negation cues, like covering or blocking his mouth and rubbing or putting his hand over his eyes, his nose, or his ears. He may also avoid making eye contact with you or turn his body or head away from you as he speaks.; , You may notice that your boyfriend’s regular tone of voice changes or shifts when he is telling a lie. He may also stammer, pause for long periods of time, or have unusual intonations. A sudden change in his speech patterns when he is talking about a certain subject, person, or event may be a sign that he is telling a lie., Similar to the physical Pinocchio effect, your boyfriend may demonstrate a Pinocchio effect in his word choice as well. Often, people who lie tend to use many more words when lying in an effort to hide the lie or distract you from the lie.According to a study by the Harvard Business School, liars tend to use more swear words when they speak, as they are so focused on the lie they neglect to use proper terms or clean language.Your boyfriend may also use the third person when lying to distance himself from the lie he is telling you and he may try to change the subject quickly after he has told a lie to avoid drawing attention to it.  Though people may lie for many different reasons, in general, people tell lies to hide something from another person, to hurt another person, or to make themselves seem greater or better than they really are. It may be helpful for you to consider which reason may be motivating your boyfriend to lie to you.If your boyfriend is lying to you to keep something from you, it may be useful to approach his lie as a way to reveal a truth he is hiding. If you and your boyfriend are just starting to date seriously, he may lie to you to hype himself up to you and make himself seem more worthy of your attention. However, if you think your boyfriend may be motivated to lie to you to hurt you, you may want to consider if his lies are a red flag that there are other issues in the relationship that need to be addressed.  If you have complained about your boyfriend's behavior before, you may feel like you are partly to blame for him covering up his bad habit or behavior. But it's important to remember that you are not to blame for your boyfriend's lies, as only your boyfriend can be responsible for his behavior. Part of being an adult in a mature relationship is being willing to take responsibility for one's own actions. Your boyfriend should be willing to take the blame for his lies and you should not feel you are responsible for his choices.   No one can be "made" to lie, it is a choice they make and it is their responsibility to own up to their choice. Keep this in mind as you try to deal with your boyfriend's lies.  If you catch him in a lie, or notice tell tale signs he is lying when he is speaking to you, think about what you were talking about together that triggered the lie or motivated him to lie. You could be discussing an event you were both supposed to attend together, but he backed out at the last minute, or you may be talking about a person he works with.Thinking about the context of the lie may also help you determine why he felt the need to lie to you. This way, when you confront him, you can explain why he think he is lying and be honest and open about your feelings. There are many different reasons why people lie to their partners, and it may be useful to consider common relationship scenarios where someone may lie. For example, maybe you criticized certain bad habits your boyfriend cultivates, such as smoking or spending too much money. He may then lie to avoid disappointing you or to avoid receiving another lecture from you. He may also lie to avoid conflict or to avoid having to stop his bad habit.  If you have caught your boyfriend in a lie, you cannot simply demand he stops lying to you. You cannot control your boyfriend’s desire to lie to you, or his ability to lie to you. However, you can control if your boyfriend gets away with the lie. Confronting him calmly and clearly will ensure you control how the conversation goes between you both.Rather than tell him, “I know you’re lying” or “You are a liar”, you should give him the opportunity to be honest with you. Tell him: “I think there is something going on that you’re worried about or that you do not want me to know about. I think it’s time that we bring it out into the open so we can handle it together.” This will indicate to your boyfriend that you want to be honest and open with each other and that you are not trying to accuse him of lying. Instead, you are letting him make amends and come clean on his own about the lies.  Allow your boyfriend to provide reasons for his lies, but be wary of excuses. He may have felt pressured not to be honest about his behavior because he knew you would not approve or that you would get upset if you found out. He may also be hiding an addiction or a personal problem that he does not want you to know about. Focus on ways that you can work together to try to help him deal with his issue or problem so he no longer feels the need to lie to you.   If your boyfriend is lying due to an addiction or a personal issue, you may suggest that he go for help in the form of AA or substance abuse counseling, or that he consider talking to a therapist about his issues. This will give him other ways to work on his personal issues without having to lie to you or to anyone else in his life.  Once you have given your boyfriend the opportunity to come clean, give him time to consider his response. If he explains that he did lie to you and the reason why he lied to you, you should let him know you do not think it’s appropriate that you are being lied to. This will show you are uncomfortable and unhappy with his behavior and that you expect it will not happen again., At the end of the conversation with your boyfriend about his lies, it may be useful to take a step back and analyze your relationship. Though your boyfriend may offer good reasons for his lies, if he lies to you regularly, you may want to consider if his lies are signs of deeper issues in your relationship.You may ask yourself some questions, such as: Does your boyfriend lie to you often? Do you have difficulty trusting your boyfriend? Have you confronted him about his lying before, and seen no change in his behavior? If you answer “yes” to all of these questions, your boyfriend’s lies may be part of a destructive pattern in your relationship and you may want to consider if it is worth it to be lied to by your partner on a regular basis.  

take note of his body language.  listen to his tone of voice.  notice his word choice and language.  keep in mind the three reasons individuals lie.  avoid blaming yourself for your boyfriend's lies.  consider the context around his lie.  confront him with honesty and openness.  discuss reasons why he may have lied.  make it clear you do not appreciate being lied to.  consider how the lies are affecting your relationship.

 So you've been in a relationship for some time, and maybe your girlfriend has just broken it off. It's a sad and lonely time for you right now, but focus on the things you can change about yourself before you move back on to her.   Girls want to see self-improvement from guys. Maybe your girlfriend complained about something you did while you two were in your relationship. Maybe there's something that you know you can improve simply because it will make you a better person. Well, now's the time to strike. Cut your video game playing down to a reasonable time, if that's what she wants, or start wearing cleaner clothes when you're around her. If you focus on being a better person while apart, you can go back to her with the "evidence" that you're a new guy. Recover emotionally. You don't stand a chance of getting your ex back if you're not emotionally calm and controlled. Women dislike needy, clingy, desperate men - so you need to pull your own life together before attempting to draw her back into it. Like it or not, showing her that you can deal with life on your own will attract her back to you. That's because girls like men who are self-sufficient and independent. So go out to the gym, visit the movies with friends, or start an adventure. If you're having a great time, she'll want to be there with you. Get some new clothes. New times call for new duds. It's a subtle change in you, but the importance will be clear to her: your new outer shell will signal deeper changes underneath. Get that new shirt that you've been wanting to buy, or those new pair of jeans. Looking sharp is an important aspect of physical attraction, and if she sees you looking great in unfamiliar clothes, she'll sense that there's been forward movement, if not wholesale change.; , Getting your ex-girlfriend back starts with finding the right attitude. Girls, for the most part, want to see mature, independent guys who like to have fun and know what they're good at. We know that's a lot to work, so start small if you're feeling overwhelmed.   Stop being jealous. Being jealous will get you nowhere. Jealousy is associated with fear and anxiety, two unattractive traits to have. Plus, what you're non-verbally telling her is that you want to control her. No one wants to be controlled. So learn to fight your jealousy if you can, and focus on being non-threatening. You'll get more bees with honey than you will with vinegar. Act like nothing is wrong. Even if your guts are tumbling like clothes in a washing machine, try not to let her know. She's probably not going to want you back if you're acting depressed, mopey, or sulky. Make sure you're laughing and genuinely trying to have a good time. You might find that you've become a happier person along the way. If you are feeling depressed, surround yourself with friends or family. Don't wait alone in a corner and just hope for her to come back to you. Develop a playful sense of humor. What do girls say they look for most in guys? A sense of humor and a playful attitude These two traits are attractive because they tell other people that we're youthful and not aggressive. So learn a few jokes if you can (friends are always good to try them out on) and keep the ones that work and throw away the ones that don't. Learn to make fun of yourself a little, in a confident way — not a mopey way. And, for goodness sake, be playful, especially when you're around her. Tease her lovingly, or play a small prank on a friend. You'll notice the difference in her.  At least for a little while, give her some time to think about the relationship. If you had a great relationship, she'll think about all the good things that you did for her and feel the absence of you in her life.   Cut off all communication. Maybe you don't talk to her for a couple weeks, or perhaps a month. This is tough and it will hurt, but really it's killing her more. This will also let your tempers cool down if things were heating right when you broke up. You need to give her space for three reasons: 1) People simply need space; if you can't give her any space, maybe that's something you can work on to show her that you've changed. 2) She'll get an opportunity to realize how good you are; not that she doesn't know this already, but she may not feel it in her bones. 3) You'll show her how independent you are on your own; the "rebel" is so attractive to women because he's totally on his own and doesn't need other people.  Don't do anything with her, but strike up a friendship. You want to raise your own stock by showing her that other girls like you and are attracted to you.   Don't get this step confused with pursuing another girl. You want to hang out and talk, do fun things together, but not hook up. If you hook up with another girl, your chances of getting back together with your ex are greatly diminished. Go out with a group of girls. Show your ex that attentive girls like being around you. These girls will be your wing-women. If you can pull together a big group of popular, intelligent, smart girls, chances are your ex is going to feel more interested, maybe without even noticing it.  The alpha male, in nature, is the male in a group of primates that has the highest rank, and gets his pick of the females.   Most girls are attracted to the alpha male for deep biological reasons: They believe he can provide for them better, protect them better, and give her biologically fit children. Even if you don't think that alpha males are your ex's type, subtle changes might work on her: pump out your chest a bit, make an effort to work out your arms and thighs, and project strength.  Whether you broke up with her, or she broke up with you, an apology is almost always in order. An apology shows her that you're capable of swallowing your ego, and that you care enough to tell her you were wrong. If done correctly, an apology will work wonders.   Send her flowers. Girls love flowers, for reasons men still don't know. They die after a week, and they just sit around gathering dust. Well, odds are your ex probably loves them, because they smell pretty and look good and she gets to show them to her friend and brag about how much someone cares for her. You want to be that someone. Send her a letter. Girls also love letters, because they take a lot of time and you have to express your feelings. Start off by saying something like: "I know this letter doesn't fix what's broken between us, and maybe it never will. But I want you to know that I care deeply about you, and I always will. That part has never changed. The part that's changed is that I realize how stupid I was to let you go." Tell her in person. Set a time to meet in a public place, or a place that you know she'll feel comfortable in. When the time is right, say: "I know I made some mistakes during our relationship, and I wanted to take full responsibility for those. I shouldn't have done to you, and I feel horrible now. But the biggest mistake I made was losing you. I don't expect anything from you, I just want you to know that."  , Maybe some trust was broken in your relationship, and now it's time for you to start repairing it. Trust for girls is a big thing. You want to show her that she can trust you again, that you are worthy of her trust.   Do something nice for her without expecting her to pay you back. If she's studying late for an exam, pop by with her favorite tea or coffee and let her know that you know she's going to kill it tomorrow. If one of her friends gets in an accident, stop by and pay your respects (the friend will definitely let your ex know you stopped by). If your ex mentions she wanted to see a movie, buy her two tickets for her and her friend to see, and don't butt in. Your time will come soon. Go out for coffee or tea together. Ride your bikes into town. Hang out at the pool. Have conversations about things both of you find funny, or like talking about. Remember to act confident, be funny, and get that playfulness out so that she can see it.  Once you've apologized and become her friend again, you can finally tell her you want her back. Try to pick a romantic spot to do this, and try to tell her when it's just you two. It won't hurt if you're looking your best.   Be honest about how you feel, within reason. Don't tell her what she might have done wrong in the relationship. Instead, focus on you. Let her know that you've thought a lot about where things went wrong, and show her all the ways in which you've changed. Tell her how you've become more patient, more forgiving, more aware of your own shortcomings, and be sure to back it up with action. If you say you've become more forgiving, be able to show her that you're not as quick to point out other peoples' faults. You can say something like: "After we broke up, I realized I was looking for love in the wrong places. I realized that you gave me exactly what I need, and it's really a shame that I had to realize that after we broke up. But I realize it now, and I'd be stupid not to try to get you back, because you're exactly what I need." Or you can say something like: "You may not like it, but most of what I do now, I do it for you. You've made a better person. I understand what it means to care for someone now that I've been with you. I want to share that with you again, this time better. Because I can't deny that I still have feelings for you. I'd be lying to myself and lying to the world." Assure her that you both can fix the issues that led to your breakup. Remember why you guys broke up in the first place, so you can learn from your own mistakes. Have a plan ready, and discuss that plan with her. It's no use in getting back together if you go through the same issues all over again. If you didn't listen to her feelings enough, be sure that you're listening when you tell her you like her. If you didn't get along with her friends, make an extra effort to get along with them. Have a plan to attack what's likely to go wrong, and you'll impress the socks off of her.  

get your life back on track.  get the right attitude.  leave her alone.  start talking to another girl.  tap your inner alpha male.  give her an apology.  slowly work up to friendship.  tell her you still have feelings for her. 

 These are the best leaves for a compost pile. They usually have higher mineral content than manure.; , Keep it at 10 to 15 percent of your pile. Oak leaves contain more acid that other leaves, which can be poor compost for vegetable gardens.  If you only have a few types of trees on your property, visit heavily wooded sections of the town in late fall. Ask people you see raking if you can bag up leaves or take their bags of weeds.   Most leaves in a city are swept up with a street sweeper. You can check the fall street sweeping schedule and go the day before to collect extra leaves from the curb. Try to avoid picking up the leaves at the very bottom of curb piles, because they can contain oil and other residue from cars. Call landscaping companies to ask if they give away leaves they gather. Pick up the leaves at the company’s location. , The addition of grass clippings will save you time adding nitrogen later on.  Have 1 person pile the leaves while the other person grinds.  Self-propelled mowers are hard to control through a leaf pile.  Leaves that are ground up will compost much more quickly than those that are whole.  You can also use wooden slats, like those on a shipping crate. Either material will allow oxygen to get to your compost. If possible, build a swinging gate into 1 side of your compost bin. This opening will allow you to turn your compost more easily and to remove it when you want to use it.  Compost, when done properly, takes about 6 months. You can start a compost pile in the fall and distribute it through the garden in the spring, before you plant.  When you first start the pile, it will be loose and prone to blowing around the yard. Plan to cover the compost pile with a plastic tarp, if you cannot construct a container.  Don’t place it on concrete or it will create standing water.  The easiest method is to use bags of grass clippings from your mower. , Avoid dairy, dense breads or meats.  You should put several bags (3 to 5) of leaves on the pile, then add a bag of manure or grass clippings, vegetable scraps or manure.  During dry weather, sprinkle it with a garden hose. Avoid creating standing pools of water, which can encourage mold. The compost should be damp enough that when you can pick up a handful of compost and squeeze, only a few drops of water drip out.  The heat that forms inside the moist pile of leaves and clippings is often called “cooking.” , The top layer should be buried and the leaf compost should look fresh and wet on the top.  Frequent turning will make it cook faster.  You may need to add a little bit of water occasionally, but not very much, or it can also cause mold. , When the compost turns a uniform dark brown, you will know it is time to use it.  

rake up all the fruit tree leaves that you can find.  limit the amount of oak leaves that you use in your compost pile.  find and gather different kinds of leaves from your neighbors.  rake all your leaves together into a section of your lawn.  ,  grind your leaves on the same day you plan to cut your lawn in the fall.  pile your leaves into a section of your lawn.  grind the leaf pile with a manual mower.  dump the bags of leaf mulch into a composting pile or rake up the leaf mulch.  set up a chain link square in the corner of your yard.  choose to set up a compost pile in the center of your garden.  pile the compost in an area where it will not blow away.  make sure the compost pile is on an area of ground that will drain.  mix approximately 20 to 25 percent nitrogen-rich materials into your compost.  buy or gather manure, if you don’t have grass clippings.  ,  throw in kitchen scraps, such as vegetable peels and coffee grounds.  layer the leaves and the nitrogen addition.  keep the pile moist.  wait approximately 1 to 3 weeks before you turn your compost the first time.  use a shovel or a pitchfork to dig into the bottom to middle of the pile of compost and turn it.  turn the compost up to 3 times per week, or as little as once every 2 weeks.  cover it with a plastic tarp to trap the heat inside the compost pile.  combine your compost with your soil after 4 to 9 months.

 Making sure you are going to a reputable facility is extremely important. Research the facility to determine if they have accreditation through the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities or the Joint Commission.This information can be obtained from the facility’s website, or you can find it by contacting the appropriate government agencies.  Before choosing a treatment center, research the medical staff. This includes the clinical staff, medical staff, psychiatrist, psychologist, nutritionist, dietitian, and recreation therapist.Find out the experience and qualifications the staff has. Make sure the staff have licenses and credentials, including the dietitian and nutritionist. Go meet with the medical staff. Ask them about their experience, education, and licenses.Contact government agencies to find out if the medical staff possess proper licenses.  If it is possible, you should visit the center and take a tour of it before deciding to get treated there. While touring the facility, look around the grounds and decide if it looks like a comforting, warm environment. Ask yourself if you would be comfortable there during your recovery.Look around the area and decide if this is where you want to stay. There are treatment centers in different geographic locations, such as mountains, desert, the beach, or a serene environment. Make sure the environment is somewhere you feel happy and comfortable.Meet with the doctors and other staff at the facility. Discuss their education, their experience, and their qualifications. Talk to them about how they approach treatment and recovery. Discuss success rates with those you meet with.  Part of the treatment of eating disorders is changing negative behaviors and learning how to deal with triggers and difficult situations after the treatment. Centers should use evidence-based behavioral treatments, like cognitive behavioral therapy, in their treatment program.   Though going through therapy to discuss the causes of the eating disorder may be therapeutic or insightful, it should only be a minor part of the treatment., Aftercare programs an integral and important part of the treatment and recovery process. Aftercare programs are geared towards providing support and help to patients after their stay in a residential center has ended.Aftercare programs may include a therapist or group therapy after you leave, telephone therapy or access to a support network via the telephone, or contact from the center.Studies have shown that patients have a greater success rate if provided with an aftercare program.  

check for the facility’s accreditation.  research the medical staff.  visit the center.  make sure the center focuses on behavioral therapy.  determine if the center has an aftercare recovery program. 

 You will be massaging your stomach so you want to make sure that your belly is naked. While it is not necessary for you to be completely naked, oils can stain clothing. Drape a towel over your lap to prevent spilling. If you are applying the oils to another person, have them remove clothes to their level of comfort, making sure that you are able to fully massage their abdominal area.  You need only a dab of oil to begin with. Gently dip your fingers in the oil. You only need about an ounce of oil total for a massage. As you massage, you can reapply oil as necessary.  Use your fingertips and move in slow circles at first. Apply slight pressure to the abdomen. Next move under the breast and apply pressure, massaging downward using both hands. This massage encourages the movement of waste in your body and can be executed daily as a preventative measure as well., As you massage, it is important to remember to breathe deeply. The scents should help you relax while loosening your bowels and intestines. If you are massaging another person, gently remind them to breathe throughout the massage.  Reflexology foot massages have been found to help with constipation as they can relax your body and may increase blood flow to your intestines.With specific attention to the ankle and the heel, lean back and enjoy a foot massage. Peppermint and rosemary oils are ideal for this type of massage. After the massage, put on socks or rinse your feet with water so that you do not slip.  It is generally recommended to drink plenty of water following a massage. Water hydrates your body and helps you recover from a massage. It is also important in alleviating constipation as water flushes out the colon and loosens impacted fecal matter.  If you need to go to the bathroom, end the massage immediately and go. Do not try to hold it in until the end. If you have chronic constipation, a daily massage may be able to help you stay regular, even if you are not currently feeling constipated. 

remove your clothes.  apply a small amount of oil to your hands.  gently rub oil over abdominal area.  inhale deeply.  treat your feet.  drink plenty of water.  use the toilet. 

 The U.S. and Canadian governments do not allow manufacturers to label something 100% organic if that food has been genetically modified or been fed genetically modified feed.You may find that organic food is more expensive and different in appearance from conventional products.   Trusted Organic Certification institutions include the United States Department of Agriculture(USDA), Quality Assurance International(QAI), Oregon Tilth, and California Certified Organic Farmers(CCOF). Look for their mark of approval on the label of the product. Also, just because something says "organic," it does not mean that it doesn't contain GMOs. In fact, it can still contain up to 30% GMOs, so be sure the label says 100% organic. Eggs labeled "free-range," "natural," or "cage-free" are not necessarily GMO free; look for eggs that are 100% organic.; , Price lookup (PLU) codes can be found on the stickers that are on your produce. These codes can be used to identify foods have been genetically engineered or modified.If it is a 4-digit number, the food is conventionally produced. This food may or may not be genetically modified. If it is a 5-digit number beginning with an 8, it is GM. However, do not trust that GE foods will have a PLU identifying it as such, because PLU labeling is optional. If it is a 5-digit number beginning with a 9, it is organic and is not genetically modified, Most cattle in the U.S. are grass-fed but spend the last portion of their lives in feedlots in which they may be given GM corn, the purpose of which is to increase intramuscular fat and marbling. If you're looking to stay away from GMOs, make sure the cattle were 100% grass-fed or pasture-fed (sometimes referred to as grass-finished or pasture-finished).Some meats like pork and chicken cannot be 100% grassfed. In those instances, look for meat that is labeled 100% certified organic.You should also buy wild caught fish instead of farm raised fish. Farm raised fish are fed with genetically modified grains.  It was once rare to find products labeled as such, but thanks to organizations such as the Non-GMO Project,they are becoming more common. You can also research websites that list companies and foods that do not use genetically modified foods, but be aware that some information is often incomplete, and conflicting interests may not be declared.  Although more than half of all GM foods are produced in the U.S.,most of it comes from large industrial farms. By shopping at farmers' markets, signing up for a subscription from a local Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) farm, or patronizing a local co-op, you may be able to avoid GM products and possibly save money at the same time.   Shopping locally may also give you the opportunity to speak to the farmer and find out how he or she feels about GMOs and whether or not they use them in their own operation. Buying local food does not guarantee that you will be avoiding GMOs. Many local farmers use genetically modified seeds., Favor foods that you can cook and prepare yourself, rather than foods that are processed or prepared (e.g., anything that comes in a box or a bag, including fast food). What you lose in convenience, you may recover in money saved and satisfaction gained, as well as increased peace of mind. Try cooking a meal from scratch once or twice a week; you may enjoy it and decide to do it more often., If you grow your own food, you buy seeds that have not been genetically modified. This way, you know exactly what was grown and what went into growing it.   Many websites sell non-GMO seeds.You can visit Seed Saversor Seeds Nowto find non-GMO seeds.  

buy food labeled 100% organic.  recognize fruit and vegetable label numbers.  buy 100% grass-fed meat.  seek products that are specifically labeled as non-gmo or gmo-free.  shop locally.  buy whole foods.  grow your own food. 

 Some herbs will stay in sprigs, such as rosemary, parsley or thyme.Bay leaves can be frozen this way.; ,, Place in the freezer and allow to freeze.  Place into bags or suitable freezer containers. Note the date and contents before returning to the freezer. Use within two months.  

select herbs that can be turned into sprigs.  line a baking sheet or tray with parchment paper or kitchen foil.  ,  lay the sprigs across the baking sheet or tray.  remove from the freezer. 

 Some people can comfortably say "I love you" multiple times a day. Others are more reserved, feeling like over-saying it might lessen its power and beauty. Wherever you fall, there is a good way to make sure your expressions of love only come when you really mean them.If expressing your love feels like a burden on you, then you need to re-examine how you actually feel about her. Are your issues with the word "love" or the emotion of love?  , You don't have to be a broken record to express your love regularly. Telling her that you're grateful for her presence, that you're excited just being around her, that you adore her, or any other synonyms for love will get the point across without making your words seem rote or unthoughtful. Try:   "I am better because of you." "I cannot stop thinking about you." "You drive me crazy on a daily basis, and I love it." Use cutesy terms she likes, like darling, honey, doll, etc., Acknowledge the little things she does for you and let her know how cool it is. Tell her that her spaghetti sauce is especially good on the days that it is, and remind her how important her support has been when you're going through tough times. A great way to express your love is to show that you're paying attention and appreciative, making her a big part of your thoughts. Good times include:   After taking care of you or chipping in during a tough time. When you've felt stressed and are worried you've taken it out on her. Occasionally remembering regular chores or help. If she packs your lunch every morning before work for you, be sure to thank her for it.  A loving couple is a team, getting through life's challenges together, not alone. When you hold a mistake over someone's head after she has apologized, however, or you keep a grudge going because you fault her for hard times, you're breaking up the bond. Love is easily expressed in forgiveness, as it shows that your bond is deeper than one issue or mistake. Blaming someone for a problem turns things into a me vs. you scenario.Forgiveness can take time, and that is okay. The point is that you express your love through your willingness to look past honest mistakes, loving the person in her entirety, flaws and all.  Even loving couples fight, and that is okay. What is more important is how you fight. There will always be issues and differences, but loving couples know that getting things out in the open is more important than burying feelings for a later day. In it's own way, this is an expression of love to a girl — the trust that you can be honest her, and that you can trust her to do the same.   There is no such thing as doing something to "prove your love." Love isn't a loan or scientific idea — it doesn't need to be proven., People that you love are naturally part of your future. When you close your eyes, she is there by your side, and letting her know this is a great way to express your love without saying the words. This doesn't mean you map out every detail from marriage to kids — it just means you let her know you're excited to keep her in your life.   "If we could retire together right now, where would you want to go with me?" Talk about your career and living plans, dreaming, scheming, and planning together even if nothing comes of it.  

say "i love you" when you feel in love, not because you think you "must" say it.  use other words to express your love without always saying "i love you.",  let her know how much you appreciate her help and support.  offer your forgiveness and withhold your blame.  be open and honest during arguments instead of hiding or sheltering concerns.  make her a part of your plans and future. 

 Although it is certainly important to in some sense live for the future (by doing things like planning, saving, etc.) it is also very important for your well-being to enjoy life in the moment. During your day, pause a few moments. Take 5 deep breaths in and out and notice all your sensations. Try not to judge your sensations but rather just experience them freely.  Hobbies help us grow and re-charge our batteries; they stimulate our minds and our bodies and they allow for creativity. All of these things can help us to feel like we are living a good life.If you are stuck figuring out what activities to engage in, try the website: http://www.meetup.com/   , Studies show that money does buy happiness, but only up to about $75,000, and then the relationship between money and happiness (i.e., a better life) becomes much weaker.That said, depending on how you define "a better life," income may continue to be associated with greater life satisfaction the more money people make, even above $75,000. It is important to think about your particular circumstances and definition of a better life and to decide how important money is to you., Children laugh way more than adults do; they are free and happy and their lives are great and care-free.Being an adult doesn’t have to mean that life is serious and dull. Try your best to laugh and joke around each day to keep things light and fun.   If you don’t feel like generating humor yourself, try watching some stand-up comedy or a funny TV show.  If someone you know is constantly dragging you down or making you feel bad about yourself, stop associating with this person. Although you may feel guilty at first, over time without his negative influence in your life, you will likely feel better.If it is a friend, let him get the hint by responding to his messages less and less and with longer and longer delays or just stop all contact immediately. If it is a family member or someone you live with, try to avoid this person by being out of the house when he is around, or by staying in your room when he is out in the living room.  

live right now.  try new activities.  increase your income.  remember to laugh.  remove negative people from your life. 

 The A1C test measures your blood sugar control over the past two to three months and aids in the detection of Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes.This blood test is not affected by recent food intake so you don’t have to fast before the test.; , If your doctor has recommended an A1C test, she will give you a form detailing what test should be conducted. Bring the form to the laboratory you will be testing at.   You may also want to make an appointment for the test. Some laboratories or testing centers will take appointments, which should reduce the time you need to wait in line. Be sure to use a laboratory that is the primary provider for your health insurance.  The A1C test is a simple blood test that can be done by two different ways, either using a venipuncture or a finger prick test.During venipuncture, a needle will be inserted into a vein in your arm and blood is drawn into a test tube. During a finger prick test, the tip of your finger will be punctured with a needle (lancet). The laboratory technician may also gently squeeze your finger to form a blood drop that she will then collect. Once the blood is drawn, a sample is sent to the laboratory for testing  , The A1C test measures what percentage of your hemoglobin is coated with sugar, also called glycated hemoglobin. When your A1C level is higher than normal, it indicates a poor blood sugar control, which translates to a higher risk of diabetes.A normal A1C level ranges from 4.5 to 5.7% glycated hemoglobin. A 5% A1C level translates to 97 mg/dL (5.4 mmol/L) blood sugar level.Results ranging from 5.7 to 6.4% are considered to be in the prediabetic stage and indicates a higher risk for developing diabetes. Results showing an A1C level of 6.5 percent or higher are considered diabetic. If your results are positive for diabetes, your doctor may confirm the results with an oral or plasma glucose test (see below) and/or will initiate a treatment plan for you to begin.  You should be aware that the effectiveness of an A1C test may be limited, including:Falsely low A1C may result due to a recent heavy or chronic bleeding, blood transfusion or if you have an uncommon form of hemoglobin or hemolytic anemia. Falsely high A1C may result if your bloodstream doesn’t contain enough iron or you have an uncommon form of hemoglobin. The normal range for A1C results may also vary among laboratories.

 Dump out the ants and remaining contaminated food. Immediately close the bag and take outside. This helps keep the ants from crawling back out and getting back into the food., Ants leave pheromones behind that attract more ants, so make sure to thoroughly wash out the bowl with hot water and detergent. If the bowl is dishwasher friendly, you can put it through your dishwasher., After removing the ants, clean the area around the food. You have to remove the pheromone trail so ants from the colony won't return. Try using vinegar or lemon juice to erase the scent and deter future ants from approaching.You can also mop the area around the food container, or the entire kitchen floor. You can use what you normally use to mop, or use dish soap., Look for a shallow container that is wider than the cat food bowl. You can use a silver tray, a cake pan, a pie pan, a roasting tray, or anything else that will fit the cat bowl in.Make sure the container you put the cat bowl in isn't too big. However, there should be about an inch between the edge of the moat and the food bowl. This distance helps keep ants away.Some companies manufacture bowls that already incorporate the moat around the bowl's edge. These are great and easy to use and the entire bowl can be picked up and cleaned in one go. However, if you don't want to spend the money on that before seeing if it works, you can try this DIY method.  Place a small amount of water in the moat container. You don't want to fill it too high so it spills into the food, but want enough water to provide a barrier for the ants. Ants aren't good swimmers, so it should drown or deter the ants from crossing.To help keep ants from crossing the water, try placing some vegetable oil, lemon essential oil, or dishwashing soap into the moat water. But only add dishwashing liquid if the space between the moat and food bowl is too small for the cat to drink from., Put the food bowl in the water. Make sure there is at least a 1-inch space between the edge of the moat and the food bowl. Fill the food bowl with fresh food.   If the container is extra large, put the food bowl close enough to its edge so your cat will be able to reach the food without difficulty, but far enough from the edge the ants won't be able to hop across. If the food bowl is too short, use a block or other item to raise the food bowl above the edge of the moat container., The water may contain some drowned ants or spilled food. It will need refreshing as it begins to evaporate.  Eventually, the ants will stop coming. In some places, like in warmer climates, you may have to feed your cat in this manner persistently as the ants never go away.  

remove any ants already in your cat's food bowl.  wash the bowl.  clean the food area.  find a moat container.  fill the container with water.  place the food bowl in the moat container.  empty the moat container as needed.  keep up this process. 

 Use your hands to collect and lift your dry hair, and evenly apply a heat protectant spray.This will help reduce heat damage from the straightener.          Be sure that you don’t dampen your hair too much with the heat protectant spray. If you do, wait for your hair to naturally dry, or quickly blow dry your hair so you are working with dry hair.; , Use your fingers to separate your hair into 2-6 different sections. Try using the part down the middle of your head to section your hair into a right and left portion, and then section up each side into smaller sections.Do your best to make all the sections of hair the same thickness.          Keep in mind that the fewer braids you make (meaning more hair in each braid), the bigger your waves will be.The more braids you make (meaning less hair in each braid), the smaller and more crimped the waves will look.  Braid the sections of your hair using the normal three strand braiding technique. Once your braid comes within an inch or half inch from the bottom of your hair, use a thin hair tie to secure the bottom of the braid.          Where you start your braids depends on where you want the waves to start. If you want waves starting at the top of your head, make your braids as close to your scalp as possible. If you want the waves be start midway down your hair, start your braids down more, near your ears. Depending on the tightness of your braids, the end result will either be loose waves made with looser braids or tighter waves, made with tighter braids. Pull the braids apart to make them less cylindrical, and more flat. The flatness will help when moving the hair straightener along the braids., Clamp the flat iron onto one braid at a time. Start at the beginning of the braid, and hold the straightener in place for about three seconds.Open the clamped straightener, and move down the braid a little bit. Again, apply heat for about three seconds. Open and close the straightener as you move down, applying heat to the entire braid. You want to be sure that you can feel warmth on both sides of the braid. Apply heat to all of the braids.          Allow the braids to cool for about ten minutes after you have run the hair straightener over all of them. When the braids are cool, you can quickly run over the braids once more with the hair straightener, or finish up, and lightly mist the braids with a hairspray., Remove the hair ties at the bottom of each braid, and use your fingers to gently loosen and undo the braids. Don’t pull too hard, because you don’t want to mess up any of the waves. Rub the top of your head with your fingers to give your waves a more natural look and add volume your roots.         At this point, you can add a texturizing spray or hairspray to help the waves stay in place.  

apply a heat protectant.  section your hair.  braid your hair.  apply heat to the braids.  take out the braids. 

 In law school, a professor might call on you at random to discuss a case. There is no way to anticipate the questions your professor will ask. However, you can put yourself in the best position by thoroughly reading your assigned material and briefing cases., However, if you’ve done your reading, then you’ve put yourself in the best position to engage in a Socratic exchange. Take a deep breath and then smile.   It’s best to think of the Socratic questioning as a dialogue between you and your professor. Block out the other students listening in.  The purpose of the Socratic method is to identify the contradictions and limitations in our own knowledge. For this reason, you need to be honest in your answers. Don’t try to anticipate what you think the professor wants to hear.   If you’re in law school, you should know the facts of the case and the court’s holding. However, apart from the facts, there are rarely “right” or “wrong” answers. Try to get into the spirit of the questioning by understanding its purpose: not to find the right answer, but to understand what you truly think.  You’ll handle some complicated material in class, so your answers to questions might not be “yes” or “no.” Try to answer as clearly and completely as possible so that your professor understands your point.At the same time, strive to be as brief as possible. There’s no reason to give a long-winded answer if one isn’t required.  Accordingly, there is no reason to be embarrassed if you are on the receiving end of Socratic questioning and have a deer-in-the-headlights look.  You might reach a point where you can’t resolve the contradictions in your thinking. At this point you are truly stumped. Feel free to admit that you don’t know how to answer a question.   Remember that the Socratic method is something you can use with yourself throughout your life. You should constantly interrogate what you think is true.  

prepare for class.  remain calm.you might feel panic when called on.  answer questions honestly.  be as clear as possible.  realize no one is judging you.as you listen to a socratic exchange, you are probably answering the questions yourself and struggling along with your classmate.  admit when you are stumped. 

 This is a way to break deep-seated patterns by changing the perceptions of your subconscious. If you are unable to change your habits through your own will power, you can enlist the aid of a hypnotist. Hypnosis has been proven to be effective for some people dealing with addiction.  Practices such as yoga or tai chi are extremely beneficial for those trying to change their diet. While these practices are physical and a great way to get exercise, they are also extremely mental and spiritual. By getting in touch with and learning to respect your body, you can make it much easier for yourself to kick a bad habit.  If you're having a hard time figuring out how to change your diet to fit your lifestyle and come up with replacements for sugary foods, try talking to a nutritionist. A nutritionist can get you started on a diet plan that is right for your body and your lifestyle as well. It can be very hard to stay on track if you're constantly running around all day taking care of children or managing an office. Let a nutritionist do the nitty gritty work for you and help get you on the right eating path.  Diet and exercise go hand in hand. Incorporate physical activity as a regular routine in your new lifestyle. You should get at least 30 minutes of cardio activity per day to support a healthy blood flow and maintain a healthy weight. Exercise also helps to relieve stress and other anxieties that may be causing you to turn to sugar as a crutch. Find the type of exercise that works for you and make it part of your lifestyle.  

try hypnosis.  adopt a mental and physical exercise practice.  consult with a nutritionist.  get more physical exercise.

 Taking hormones to replace estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone can be beneficial for menopausal women. HRT can alleviate peri-menopausal symptoms and could even prevent osteoporosis.   Be aware of the risks of HRT and consult with your doctor prior to deciding to pursue this option. HRT can increase your risk of heart disease, breast cancer, uterine cancer, and stroke., While the efficacy of some of these in providing relief from menopausal symptoms is contested, you could still try an alternative therapy to manage your symptoms.Black cohosh might be effective in alleviating menopausal symptoms. It has not, however, been shown to improve symptoms. If you would like to use this herb to relieve symptoms like hot flashes, do so only in the short-term (six-months maximum), as long-term efficacy and safety are still contested.Phytoestrogens may be helpful in providing relief from menopausal symptoms. They are estrogens that occur in some plants and have the effect of slowing cell growth and preventing inflammation. They are found in a variety of foods and are also widely available as supplements. You may want to moderately complement your diet with phytoestrogens and keep track of any symptoms which are alleviated.  While the safety of phytoestrogens which occur naturally in food is practically uncontested, this is not the case for non-food phytoestrogens. The risks of long-term use of non-food phytoestrogens are unknown.Try herbal preparations. There are a number of herbs which you could try using to alleviate menopausal symptoms, though the efficacy of these is unknown. These include evening primrose, ginkgo, red clover, chaste-tree berry, and ginseng., Consult with your doctor if you experience any unusual pains or sensations or if you find any of your symptoms to be unbearable. Furthermore, if symptoms such as hot flashes, mood changes, or heavy bleeding during or between periods are interfering with your day to day life, see your doctor.You should see your doctor for a full physical exam (including a breast exam, a pelvic exam, and a mammogram) once a year.

 Take care to avoid substances that alter the blood supply to your brain, which include caffeine, chocolate, alcohol and various illegal drugs.These substances can cause nerves to swell and blood vessels to constrict. This can increase sensations of dizziness. If you do consume any of these, make sure you're not doing so on an empty stomach as the effects will be worsened.  Absence of good sound sleep can cause or aggravate vertigo. Try to get a full night's sleep starting at about the same time every night and waking around the same time each morning. Though everyone's sleep needs are different, most adults do best with about seven to nine hours of sleep. Children and teens may require more sleep.If you're working on trying to fall into a more consistent sleep pattern, wait until bedtime to sleep and avoid napping during the day. Naps are a great way to recharge your batteries when you have a stable sleep schedule, but they are counter-productive when trying to change sleeping habits.  The Anti-Inflammatory Diet can be particularly useful to reduce inflammation, including disorders that end in “itis”. This diet also provides all the essential vitamins and minerals, particularly if you eat a variety of foods. The general principles of the Anti-Inflammatory diet (similar to the Mediterranean diet) include the following:Keep your food as close to its original or natural form as much as possible. This means that you should try to limit any processed or prepared foods and cook from scratch as frequently as you can. Reduce your intake of salt and sugar by limiting your consumption of chips, cookies, cakes, crackers, etc. Use olive oil as your main cooking oil since it's full of healthy fats. Avoid fried or fatty foods, like onion rings, french fries, hamburgers and hotdogs, etc. Limit red meats and eat only skinless poultry or fish. Increase the amount of fish in your diet. Excellent sources of omega 3 fatty acids include salmon, tuna, sardines and anchovies. Increase all fruits, berries and vegetables. Include brightly colored berries and fruits and leafy greens, such as Swiss chard, spinach, beet and mustard greens and kale. You should also try to include broccoli, cauliflower and brussel sprouts, which have anti-inflammatory and cancer-preventing properties.Include garlic and onions into your diet as these contain anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting substances., Everyone's exercise needs are different. However, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend that adults get at least two and a half hours of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (like brisk walking) per week, along with two days of moderate strength-training exercise (like weight lifting).While this exercise may not cure your vertigo specifically, it will contribute to your overall health and well-being, much like the dietary changes suggested above.  Yoga is good for vertigo as it helps release the spasms in the muscles of the neck and keep them more flexible and supple. In the long term, regular yoga for at least 30 minutes a day will prevent re-occurrence of vertigo and ensure a better stress tolerance. Yoga also helps with balance and helps cultivate your ability to concentrate and focus.Yoga is great for the mind and body. Your stress levels will be lower, your muscles will be more relaxed, and you may experience fewer episodes of vertigo to boot. If you are experiencing vertigo, however, you should let your yoga instructor know before class so that she can offer you modifications for poses as needed.  Vertigo or dizziness may be caused by a serious underlying pathology; you should seek a professional opinion if you have frequent vertigo or dizziness. A full medical work up will help your physician rule out serious underlying pathologies, such as malignancy and tumors.   You can also contact the Vestibular Disorders Association (VEDA) to find support groups and resources that may be helpful to you.  

avoid substances that affect the circulation to your brain.  get enough sleep.  maintain a healthy diet.  exercise regularly.  do yoga.  consider seeking professional help. 

 Gold itself can be boiled with no problems. However, boiling delicate gemstones (like opals, pearls, coral, and moonstones) can cause them to crack or become damaged - especially if the jewelry is cold before boiling. Boiling is also a bad idea for jewelry with glued-in gemstones, as it can loosen the glue. However, if you're looking to clean heavily-soiled jewelry made entirely out of gold or gold jewelry that contains "strong" gemstones (like diamonds), boiling is a great choice.  You don't need to boil much water - just enough to submerge all of the jewelry in. As you're waiting for the water to boil, set your gold jewelry in a sturdy bowl or another vessel that won't be damaged by boiling water. Pyrex or metal cooking bowls/dishes are good choices.   Arrange jewelry in the dish or bowl so that no piece of jewelry is covering up another piece - water should be able to reach every piece of jewelry.  Be very careful not to spill or splash by pouring too rapidly - boiling water can cause serious burns. When all of the jewelry is completely submerged, you've added enough water.  When you can comfortably put your hands in the water, you can remove the jewelry. Follow a good boiling by scrubbing each piece of jewelry with a soft brush, then dabbing it dry with a soft towel and allowing it to sit and air-dry completely.   Don't be afraid if the water appears dirty - this is good! As boiling water loosens the dirt, wax, grime, etc. that's built up on your jewelry, it may float to the surface of the water. The dirtier your water looks, the more dirt you've removed from your jewelry!  

know when boiling is appropriate.  bring water to a boil.  carefully pour the water over your jewelry.  wait for the water to cool. 

 Regardless of why your child is disrobing, it’s never a good idea to overreact when the behavior occurs. Not only will such histrionics fail to address the underlying issue, but they can also produce unwanted emotional and behavioral side-effects. Rather, take your child’s hand, lead them to the bathroom, and supervise as they put their clothing back on.For example, if you laugh or chase the child, they can learn that their misbehavior causes fun scenes and attracts lots of attention. If you reproach the child and act embarrassed, they can learn that bodies are shameful., If your child seems particularly prone to taking off their clothes directly after getting dressed in the morning, you might be able to prevent the behavior by distracting them during this crucial interval. Put on a favorite show, start playing with a loud, shiny toy, or pull out a colorful picture book to get your toddler’s attention away from their recently donned clothing.If distraction doesn’t work, try giving your child a bottle, a healthy snack, or a pacifier.  Most toddlers learn to stop taking off their clothing once they grow up a bit and realize it doesn’t result in any positive attention. If your child persists in the behavior, though, you can discourage it more strongly by implementing short time-outs. Take them to another room and have them sit alone for five to ten minutes.If your child is refusing to get dressed after disrobing, have the time-out last as long as their refusal does. Make it clear that they can mitigate their punishment by correcting the behavior.  Many times, a toddler undresses just because they can. In such simple cases, you can prevent the unwanted behavior by making the process more difficult. A measure as simple as putting buttoned shirts and pajamas on backwards can impede their movement to the extent that they either can’t remove the offending article, or they become bored or exhausted by the ordeal.Additionally, you can switch to cloth diapers with more secure clips, apply duct tape to the diaper, or select clothes with zippers or tiny, tedious buttons. 

stay calm when your child takes off their clothes.  provide distractions after putting on clothes.  give your toddler a time-out.  dress your toddler backwards. 

 Figure out what is causing these annoying acne flare-ups or the acne that just seems to stay there forever. Some causes include:   Hormonal changes (ex. puberty, menstrual periods, pregnancy, birth control pills, or even stress) Oily or greasy beauty products. Particular drugs (ex. steroids, estrogen, and testosterone). Sweating and high humidity levels. Perimenopause or menopause.; , There are four grades of acne, and they include:   Grade 1 is mild, characterized by only a few minor pimples, blackheads, and no inflammation. Grade 2 is moderate, with more blackheads, more obvious breakouts, and there is inflammation. Grade 3 is severe, with more inflammation than in Grade 2 and more pimples not only on the face, but on other parts of the body like the chest and the back. Grade 4 is serious, this is the cystic acne and it is basically like Grade 3 only there are cysts and this type of acne is painful.  If you are in Grade 4, then you should go see a dermatologist. If you are in the earlier stages, the rest of this article will help you prevent getting the painful cystic acne.  Wash your face 1-2 times a day (depending on how oily your skin is). Be sure to select a good acne face wash, perhaps start with a typical salicylic acid wash that you could find at a drugstore (Neutrogena is a good start brand), or you could move on to a benzoyl peroxide wash. Just stick with one wash for about a month to see if it works for you or not, if you're not consistent though, you might not get results.  Also the toner leaves your skin feeling very refreshed and clean. If you have dry skin this step is not recommended since it can dry your skin even more.  Be careful though, as some treatments can dry your skin excessively. To avoid this, gradually use the treatment more regularly. Such as; one application every two days to two daily applications or whatever feels comfortable with your skin. Don't be afraid to experiment and also be patient, results won't happen in one day!  , If the past steps haven't worked, it might be a good idea to visit a dermatologist and ask them what to do about your acne. Don't be afraid to ask them, their job is all to do with the skin. But in order to be prepared for the possible treatments you might receive, here is a list of some options your dermatologist might suggest:   Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) Oral Antibiotics Hormone Therapy Isotretinoin  

determine the cause.  determine if the acne you have is cystic acne or not.  start off with the least harsher cleansers in your skin regimen.  use a toner if you have particularly oily skin.  use an acne treatment, if your acne is more severe.  see a dermatologist. 

 The program will guide you, asking where it can find the left image, and then where it can find the right image. After you've selected the images, both will appear side by side.  It takes you to a window that displays both images semi-transparently. You can then drag one until it lines up well with the other.   Ideally you want to make the two images match up perfectly vertically, and match up horizontally for things in the very center of the picture. Line up the two images as well as you can and click OK.  The multicolored icon to the left of the vertical red-blue icon is there to see your image as an anaglyph. Now that you've aligned them, click on that and put on your 3D glasses.

 The first step to increasing your situational awareness is to assess your surroundings in full. Look around you and take account of the type of situation you are in. Different environments will require different levels of focus to maintain high situational awareness.A city environment presents very different dangers and distractions than a rural one. By identifying the type of environment you are in, you can better prepare yourself to keep a look out for possible risks.; , The environmental baseline is what you’ve experienced in similar environments and situations. Determine what should be considered normal sounds, behaviors and sights in your current situation so you have a frame of reference to compare unusual behavior to.The environmental baseline in a wooded area is often fairly quiet and usually interrupted only by the sounds of insects, birds, and the wind passing through the trees. It also may be dimly lit and is often sparsely populated by other people. The environmental baseline on a busy city street would include the sounds and sights of multiple vehicles and crowds of people talking at a normal volume for the level of ambient noise. Environmental baselines are based on your experiences. Establishing them requires you to consciously consider environments you are familiar with so as to be able to distinguish situations or behaviors that are abnormal.  Once you have established what you feel the environmental baseline of your surrounding area is, look around to identify and consider any possible sources of dangerous situations.Look for people that are behaving in a manner that is outside the norm, based on your past experiences and by comparison to those around them. Identify individuals that may be armed with weapons of opportunity, which are things that may not be considered a weapon, but could do serious harm to you or those around you. Common examples could be baseball bats or chains. Look for weapon imprints on people’s clothing. When one carries a concealed weapon, it often leaves what is commonly referred to as an “imprint” or outline of parts of the weapon in the clothes. Look near the waist band of suspicious individuals to try to determine if they are carrying a concealed weapon. Look for bags, suitcases or similar things that shouldn’t be left alone in crowded areas but have been. Leaving unattended bags in public places is a common delivery method for explosives.  While it’s not always good to let your imagination run wild about possibly dangerous situations, you can use it to establish scenarios in your mind and plan for ways to address them.If you notice a group of suspicious individuals heading in your direction, think about what you might do if they attempted to attack you or those around you. Look for ways out of your current environment if you needed to leave quickly. Imagine someone drawing a weapon or attacking you in your current situation. What can you do now to make it less likely? What will you do if it happens anyway?  , Because most people live fairly safe lives, we tend to believe things are going to work out. People often wait to respond to abnormal behavior because they are unwilling to recognize it as a threat. "Normalcy Bias" is the act of ignoring prospective threats because it seems unlikely that a dangerous situation might occur..Take indications of danger seriously. Don’t tell yourself that what you are seeing “must be normal.” Approach each situation as though it could become dangerous. This will help you overcome the normalcy bias.  When you focus on one thing so hard that you are too distracted to identify potential threats around you, that is referred to as “focus lock.” Focus lock is a perfectly normal thing to do, but it can significantly hinder or reduce your situational awareness.A common example of focus lock causing a dangerous situation is looking at your phone instead of the road while driving. On a hiking trail, you may be so distracted by the sights and sounds ahead of you that you don’t notice a snake near your feet in the brush. When you catch yourself experiencing focus lock, draw your attention back to your environment and any potential threats around you.  The passage of time is an important part of situational awareness. Keeping track of the time can help you identify trends in people’s behavior that may not otherwise have seemed unusual to you. It also can help you to prevent fatigue by knowing how long it’s been since you last ate or rested.If you notice someone walking laps around an area at regular intervals, they may be waiting for something to happen. There’s nothing inherently dangerous about that, but it’s an element that noticing could help you avoid dangerous situations. Keep track of how long it has been since you last saw the people you are with. Waiting for your child outside of a public bathroom, for instance, is a situation where you may want to keep track of how long it’s been since you’ve seen them.  In the military, a common phrase used in training is “complacency kills.” Complacency occurs when you become so comfortable in your current situation that you no longer work to actively identify possible threats around you.If you feel your mind wandering or catch yourself experiencing focus lock, bring your attention back to the present moment and the situation at hand. Remind yourself that dangerous scenarios can occur anywhere, including environments that you feel very comfortable in like your home or a restaurant you go to often.  Fatigue makes it extremely difficult to remain attentive and focused. When you’re hungry, dehydrated or tired you grow distracted. Reduced blood sugar levels caused by prolonged periods of not eating can make you just as groggy as a lack of sleep.Take good care of yourself by getting enough sleep and eating well and often. Notice the signs of fatigue as they set in: you may find it harder to pay attention to things, notice your temper is shorter, or your vision may blur slightly.  Sometimes you may draw unwanted attention by looking directly at a possible threat. In some extreme cases, a possible threat may become a real one if they interpret your looking at them as engaging them in some way. Because of this, practice looking at things from the sides of your vision.Some individuals may approach you or even become hostile if they notice you looking directly at them. Using your peripheral vision means any dangerous individuals in your vicinity won’t know exactly what you’re looking at, allowing you a slight tactical advantage.  By establishing a situational baseline, you create an idea in your head of what normal should look, sound, and smell like where you are. Use that baseline to predict events that will occur around you so they don’t take you by surprise.If you see a truck pull into a parking lot near you, you can predict that you may hear the sounds of its doors opening and closing or the beeping of its backup alarm. If you are driving behind a school bus, you can predict that it may stop to let children off in front of you at some point. If you notice people behaving in an aggressive manner toward one another, you may predict that they could fight, which may be a sign that you should exit the area.  Sometimes you’ve identified the situational baseline in your mind, assessed any possible threats around you, have a strategy to get away from anything that may happen, but you still can’t shake a sense that something’s wrong. Trust that feeling.You may be unaware of how your body is interpreting stimuli surrounding you, but humans have evolved to sense danger. If you feel uneasy, but don’t have objective reason to, trust that feeling. In a classic case of “it’s better to be safe than sorry,” trusting your gut about a situation and leaving may prove to have been unnecessary, but it’s better to be wrong about it a hundred times than to have been right once without acting.  Where you stand can be extremely important to your ability to maintain situational awareness. If you are in a crowded environment with too many people to keep track of, for instance, you may want to position yourself with your back to a wall so you can see anyone approaching you as they come.Different situations may require different positioning, but always try to put yourself in a place where you would be able to identify any possible threats as they approach. Positioning yourself near exits may make it easier for you to quickly escape a situation as it occurs.  In crowded city streets, it will likely be more common for people to come into your personal space that it might be in a grocery store or at a park. Personal space is commonly considered to be a circle around you at arm’s length. If anyone comes into that area (close enough to make contact with you) quickly identify any possible threat they may pose.Look for signs of a weapon either in their hands or on their body if you can see one. Look at their face to see if they are focused on you or if they are simply passing by. Notice where their hands are and what they are doing with them. If they are going to attack you, their hands will likely be balled into fists or possibly could be carrying a weapon.  

assess your surroundings for threats.  be aware of what should be normal in your situation.  identify and gauge the danger of elements around you.  use your imagination to plan for different situations.  don't assume abnormal behavior doesn't pose a threat.  don’t get distracted.  pay attention to time.  fight against complacency.  don’t let fatigue set in.  use your peripheral vision to identify threats.  try to predict upcoming events around you.  trust your gut feelings.  position yourself to easily identify threats.  immediately identify dangerous factors of those who enter your personal space. 

 Measure the wearer's ankle to shoulder height. After that, measure the person's arm span. If you know you want it bigger, add extra length to the arm span.       ; , Cut a rectangle the length of their ankle-shoulder height and the width of their arm span on the separate sheet of fabric.          Round off the corners, if desired. This is most easily accomplished by folding the rectangle in quarters (in half once lengthwise, then in half once width-wise) and cutting all of the corners at one time so that they are all curved equally.  Mark the halfway point of the neck edge with a pencil; this is for the center point of the neck divot.          Measure your neck and add two inches to that measurement.              Find the diameter by dividing by Pi or by three (will yield a slightly larger diameter, but in a cloak, that is not a bad thing). Divide your diameter in half and mark the neck hole by measuring out from the center point to points the distance of that radius from the center point. Cut the fabric, following your marks.  Generally a 1/2" (1.25 cm) seam allowance is sufficient. It will depend on how your fabric cuts -- some felts don't even need to be hemmed.  Attach a brooch, clasp etc., onto one side and pin it through to the other. This will keep the cloak securely on the wearer. If you don't have one, hit up your local thrift shops for inexpensive costume jewelry.         

start taking measurements.  grab your scissors.  begin working on the neck area.  hem the edges.  embellish. 

 Place a large pot on your camping stove, and add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil. Allow the oil to heat on medium-high until it begins to shimmer, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes., Once the oil is heated, add 1 small, minced onion to the pot. Let the onion cook until it is translucent, which should take 1 to 3 minutes., When the onion is translucent, add ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of garlic powder to the mixture. Stir well, and let the mixture cook until it is fragrant, which should take approximately 1 minute.If you prefer, you can use 2 minced cloves of garlic in place of the garlic powder.  After the mixture has become fragrant, add a 14.5-ounce (411 g) can of diced tomatoes, a 14.5-ounce (411 g) can of chicken broth, ½ tablespoon (1 g) of dried basil, 1 tablespoon (6 g) of Italian seasoning, and ½ pound (227 g) of pasta to the pot. Mix well to ensure that all of the ingredients are combined.You can use any type of pasta that you like for the dish. Don’t worry if the liquid doesn’t cover the pasta completely right away. As it cooks, the sauce will thicken and cover the pasta.  Once the ingredients are mixed, place the lid on the pot. Allow the mixture to come to a boil, which should take 10 to 15 minutes., When the mixture has come to a boil, take the lid off the pot. Continue to cook the mixture until the pasta is tender but still has some bite.The best way to determine if the pasta is done cooking is to taste it and see if you are happy with the texture.  Once the pasta is finished cooking, spoon the pasta into two bowls. Top the bowls with a handful of parmesan cheese and fresh basil, and serve while it’s still warm. 

heat the olive oil in the pot.  saute the onions until translucent.  mix in the garlic powder and cook until the mixture is fragrant.  stir in the tomatoes, broth, basil, italian seasoning, and pasta.  cover the pot and allow it to come to a boil.  remove the lid and cook the pasta until it’s al dente.  divide the pasta between two bowls and top with cheese and basil.

 Set your oven to 325°F (163°C) and let it heat up. The process of seasoning cast iron involves coating it with a layer of oil and baking it. Seasoning, or curing, the pan will cover it with a non-stick surface, make the pan easier to clean, and protect it from rust.   Most new cast iron pans come pre-seasoned, but you'll have to season any that haven't been cured by the manufacturer.You can still season a new pan if it comes pre-seasoned, and you should definitely season an old or second-hand cast iron pan before using it.; , Fill a sink with a small amount of hot, soapy water. Immerse a clean sponge in the soapy water, then wash the cast iron pan. Rinse the pan under hot water and dry it completely with a clean towel.You can also use a dish brush with stiff bristles to clean the pan. Most people recommend not washing cast iron with soap once it has been seasoned, because the soap can slowly remove the seasoning. However, because you're about to season the pan, use soap now to make sure the pan is clean.  Dip a clean cloth or paper towel into some vegetable shortening. Rub the shortening over the inside and outside of the skillet to coat the pan with a thin and even layer.It’s best to use a small amount of solid shortening for seasoning, because too much shortening or using liquid oil can leave a sticky residue on the pan.  Place a cookie sheet or piece of foil on the bottom rack of the oven. Then place the skillet upside down on the middle rack. Bake the empty skillet for an hour.   The baking sheet is important because it will catch any shortening that melts and drips off the pan.  After an hour, turn off the oven. Leave the skillet in the oven as it cools, about one to two hours. Remove the pan from the oven once it’s cool. Buff the pan by rubbing it with a paper towel or clean cloth to remove excess shortening.When you're finished, the pan should be a smooth and shiny black.  Over time, this non-stick layer may wear away, especially if you use the pan to cook non-fatty foods. Repeat the seasoning process every few months, or when:The pan loses its luster and becomes dull The color changes from black to dark gray Food starts sticking to the pan  , Clean your pan as soon as possible after cooking with it. The longer food cools in the pan, the harder it will be to clean. After cooking with your cast iron pan, hold it under hot running water. While the water is running, wipe the pan out with a clean cloth to remove food particles.For mildly soiled and well-seasoned pans, this may be all you need to clean your cast iron. If you're worried about bacteria because you aren't using soap, just make sure to preheat your cast iron before adding food. Cast iron heats up very quickly, and even over medium heat the pan will quickly reach temperatures high enough to kill any bacteria., For food that’s still stuck on your pan or baked-on leftovers, sprinkle the inside of a warm pan with a generous layer of coarse salt. Scrub the surface of the pan with a damp dish cloth to remove the stuck-on food.   When the food has been removed, discard the salt and scraps and rinse the pan out with hot water., Remove excess water from the pan by drying it with a towel immediately after cleaning it. Return the pan to the stove and warm it over low heat until all the water has evaporated, about two minutes.Never let cast iron cookware air dry, as this will cause the iron to rust.  With the pan still on low heat, coat it with an additional layer of vegetable shortening, using a cloth or paper towel to spread the shortening evenly over the pan. Leave the pan on the heat for another 10 minutes.After 10 minutes, remove the pan from the heat and set it aside to cool. Before putting it away, wipe out any excess shortening with a cloth or paper towel. Fully seasoning a pan is a process that happens over time. As you add more oil to the pan and cook fatty foods in the cast iron, the surface will become more protected and more non-stick.  Iron is highly susceptible to rust, which can be caused when the metal is exposed to air and water. Seasoning your cast iron pan regularly will help prevent it from rusting. It’s important to remove rust spots immediately if they do begin to form, otherwise they will quickly spread.   Wet a mildly abrasive sponge or scrub pad with soapy water and scrub the rusted spots on the pan. To remove tough rust spots, try a bit of vinegar on the sponge. Rinse the pan under hot water. Re-season the pan by coating it in vegetable shortening and baking it in the oven for an hour.  There are a few things you can do to a cast iron pan that will virtually guarantee rust. To prevent rust from forming, avoid exposing the metal to moisture as much as possible:   Never immerse cast iron directly in water. Clean the pan by running water over, rather than submerging it in a full sink. Always dry cast iron cookware fully after using and washing. Store the pans in cupboards or from hooks with the lids off. Lids can trap air and moisture against the surface of the pan, and this will cause the metal to rust., The seasoning layer will protect your cast iron from small amounts of acid, so it’s ok to cook mildly acidic foods in your pan for short periods of time. But acidic foods that require long simmering times, such as tomato sauce, should be cooked in other cookware.With a long-simmering acidic food, the acid can find weak spots in the seasoning layer, and this can eat away at the seasoning and start to corrode the metal. Be sure to remove acidic foods from your cast iron as soon as they're cooked, and wash the pan immediately., Always wash your cast iron by hand, and never put it in the dishwasher. The dishwasher will expose the pan to too much moisture, and this can lead to rust.   You should also avoid metal scouring pads on the cast iron, as these can damage the seasoning layer.Harsh soaps and detergents can also remove the seasoning, so avoid them unless you plan to re-season the pan right away.  Never pour cold water into a hot cast iron pan, as this can lead to cracking and warping. If your pan is still hot from cooking, only use hot water to clean it. 

preheat your oven.  wash and dry the skillet.  coat the skillet with shortening.  bake the skillet.  cool and clean the skillet.  repeat as necessary.  rinse the pan with hot water.  scour with salt if necessary.  dry the pan immediately.  oil the pan.  remove rust.  prevent rust from forming.  avoid long-simmering acidic foods.  avoid cleaning methods that can cause damage.  use hot water to clean hot pans. 

 Mary-Jane shoes are the quintessential Lolita footwear. The shoes can be flat for a simple touch, or you can opt for high platform Mary-Janes if you want a more authentic and bolder style choice. Stick with black or white shoes for the most versatility, and pair the shoes with white knee-high or over-the-knee socks. Avoid sheer tights or ankle socks.  The headdress should arch over your head like a headband. You can even opt for a headband, but look for a fabric band with lace or ruffles to mimic the Lolita style.  An Alice bow refers to a large bow that sits at the center top of your head, based on the look of the titular character in Alice in Wonderland. You can also vary this style by wearing a large hair bow tilted off to the side, which may help the style blend more easily into your everyday attire.  Small hair bows also call to mind Lolita fashion. Wear your hair in high pigtails and tie them up with fancy bows. Alternatively, look for a small, lacy hair bow to pin on the side of your head, regardless of your hairstyle.  A hair corsage is a fancy flower arrangement you pin or weave into your hair. The flowers are usually made of cloth, and one or more cloth flowers can be used. Choose a more ladylike flower, like a rose, over a girlish flower, like a daisy.  Find a decorative apron with frills, ribbon, bows, or lace. You can select a half-apron that only covers your skirt, or a full apron that also comes up over your torso. It should be decorative, however, and reminiscent of a stereotypical “French maid” apron, so ordinary kitchen aprons may not work.  Pearls have an old-fashioned, classic aura to them, and ribbons call to mind a sense of demure femininity. If you wear jewelry, look for large pearl or mock pearl pieces held together by glossy satin ribbons. Make it stand out even more by choosing ribbons with a lace edging.    Brush a pale foundation over your face. Dust your cheeks with a light pink blush. Make your lashes stand out with a light coating of mascara. Add a light pink lip gloss to your lips to complete the look. Alternatively, skip the blush and outline your eyes in black eyeliner to create a Gothic Lolita look. Instead of pink gloss, opt for red lipstick, instead.  

wear mary-jane shoes with knee-high socks.  look for a frilly, rectangular headdress.  opt for an alice bow.  try smaller bows for a less overwhelming look.  consider a hair corsage.  wear a maid-style apron.  stick with pearls and ribbons.  keep your make-up fair and youthful. 

 Simply use a marker to draw on rocket features, such as windows, rivets, a door, even a person waving through the window. You might also like to add a flag of a country, a name for the rocket and other distinguishing features.   Not sure what to draw? Do an online image search of real rockets for suitable images to inspire you. You could even print off decals, etc., and glue them on the rocket tube.; , Also decide on the amount. Two to three fins is about standard for a rocket, so choose how many you prefer.   Measure the fins up against the size of the paper towel tube and draw fin shapes on cardboard. Then cut them out. Glue against the sides of the tube, checking that they're firmly held in place. (Alternatively, make slits and push them upward, then glue in place). Check that the fins are balanced each side before gluing; they should all reach down the same distance.  Its diameter should match the circumference of the paper tube. (Use your judgment or a compass.)  ,,, Pack it tightly to help the cone keep it shape. Tape it in at the base, so that it can't fall out.  Check that it fits snugly; if not, continue to add tape on it until it does. If it's too big, you'll have to make a new, smaller cone.  Do this twice. Cut out the circles and check they are able to slide inside the tube.  Angle them slightly, for the rocket's internal engine. , Trace around a round object such as a can, onto paper. Cut out the circle for the template.  These holes become the rocket windows and sitting areas for toys.   Keep the holes away from the top and base of the rocket, as these areas will have the rocket cone and fins added to them.  Use a large drill bit.  Gently guide the jigsaw to cut out the circle design you've marked. Repeat for each circle on the tube.  Use a strong craft knife to cut three slits at even places around the base of the tube. These may need to be adjusted later, but for now, just begin them.  You can either paint with a paintbrush or spray paint the whole tube. Either way, ensure that you have adequate ventilation and that wherever you're doing the painting is covered for spills.  This will form the fins at the base of the rocket, so measure the fin height against the tube, to ensure it will be stable enough to hold the rocket up. Cut out the fin shape and use this as a template.  Repeat three times, then cut out the fin shapes with a craft knife or a box cutter.  These are best done in a contrasting color to the color used for making the rocket colorful.   Alternatively, cover the fins with colored paper or colored duct tape.  Draw a large semi-circle on the poster board. Its diameter should match the circumference of the tube. (Use your judgment or a compass.)   Cut out the semi-circle. Twist into a cone shape and tape in place. If you didn't use colored poster board, it can be painted or use colored duct tape. , Make adjustments as needed; stand the rocket on the fins and see if it is level or needs changes.   It might help to glue the fins in place.  The rocket can be played with imaginary beings or dolls/stuffed toys can be put into the holes of the rocket and sent skyward (just be sure to advise the kids to hold onto it still, as although it's strong, it's not suitable for throwing).  

decorate the paper towel tube before adding fins and the cone.  decide on how long you want the fins to be.  draw a large circle on colored paper.  cut the circle halfway.  ,  fold into a cone shape.  ,  stuff newspaper in the cone gently but firmly.  affix the cone to the top of the rocket tube; tape in place.  trace the base of the paper towel tube onto thin card or thick paper.  slide in the two circles.  done.  ,  make a circle template.  trace it onto the cardboard tube in three evenly situated places.  drill a hole into the center of each circle.  insert the jigsaw blade into the drilled hole.  make fin slits at the base of the rocket.  paint the rocket.  make a fin shape on paper.  draw the fin shape onto cardboard.  paint the fins.  make the rocket cone.  glue the cone to the top of the rocket tube.  ,  insert the fins into the base of the rocket.  fly to the moon. 

 Playing games online can be highly addictive – your child gets hooked to a favorite game and shuns mealtimes unless gorging on potato crisps in front of the computer counts as a meal. Sounds familiar? That’s when you, the parent, need to step in and enforce limits. About 1 – 1 ½ hours every day should be okay. More than that and he’s likely to get addicted and you’ll have your work cut out for you. So let him know how much is too much before it’s too late.; , You know he’s feverishly trying to get to the maximum level, achieve the maximum score, or whatever it is that’ll help him beat the game. And while determination is a desirable quality, too much of it can be harmful. Forbidding him to play online games won’t work; what you need to do is encourage him to play different kinds of online games. If he’s into action games, buy or rent RPG games. If he’s crazy about simulation, trying out a few strategy games will be a healthy change. Anything that challenges his thinking and playing skills is fair game.  Many times, kids get bored and play video games because they think there’s nothing else to do. But you certainly know better, so help him learn about the hundreds of fun, creative and productive activities he could do if only he would get off the computer! Allow him to pick something he enjoys – cooking, sports, crafts, reading, bowling – the list is endless. As long as the activity involves some amount of physical movement and enables him to exercise his mind, he should be fine.  

regulate the amount of time.  encourage experimenting with different kinds of games.  help him develop other interests. 

 A great way to create one cheaply is to go to a store and buy a toy lightsaber. Take off the top of the toy and remove the plastic blade.; , Buy rubber tubing that fits snugly around the dowel. Replace the top of the toy and insert the tubing. Insert the dowel into the tubing.  Screw the handle, tube and dowel together. ,, Drag into the composition. Create a solid white layer over the footage. click the eye to make it see-through. Using the pen tool, click the corners of the lightsaber on the first frame. Connect to make a box. You should see a white mask over the lightsaber prop.  Click the stopwatch next to "Mask Path" Go on tho the next frame and drag the corners of the mask so it fits the lightsaber (make sure the pointer and white solid layer is selected).  If the lightsaber is blurred, make the mask over the entire blur.  You cannot edit the mask after this. Go to each layer and push "MM" adjust the "Mask Feather" to 5 for the first layer, 10 for the second, 15 for the third, 25 for the fourth and 40 for the fifth layer.  Create a solid black layer under the white solid layers.  Drag the footage into the composition. Drag the first composition into the new composition on top of the footage. They should align. For first comp layer, under "mode" change the blending mode to "screen".  Adjust the highlight and midtone colors until you get the appropriate lightsaber color. Make sure to check "Preserve Luminosity"  , Rotoscoping is the only way!  

create the lightsaber prop.  buy a dowel rod about 1 meter (3.3 ft) long and 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter.  drill various holes into the side of the handle so that they go all the way into the dowel.  adjust the screws so that the blade is centered.  ,  film the scenes with the lightsaber.  ,  import into adobe after effects.  select the solid layer and push "mm" on the keyboard.  move forwards a couple frames at a time and let the computer fill the frames between, but touch-ups are almost always necessary.  once the entire footage is rotoscoped (edited frame by frame), click the solid layer and push "ctrl + d" 4 times.  delete the footage from the composition.  create a new composition and adjust the size so it matches the first composition.  apply the "color balance" effect to the first comp layer.  enjoy the realistic effect this method makes! 

 The external links explain different types of poems and descriptions of each.; , If you're going through a life (or love!) crisis, or maybe a problem such as an addiction, use your experience to provide a topic. You may want to begin with a title to focus your thoughts. Or just start with whatever is on your mind. Perhaps you are feeling sad or angry, or maybe you're missing someone or feeling other internal pain. Let your thoughts flow on the paper until you don't have anything more to add.  (For example, if you want to write about doomed romance, you can get ideas from Romeo and Juliet.)  , Tell the reader what you did, what you touched, specific memories, or make comparisons to nature or the world. Readers are curious to learn about you, but in order to touch readers and make them care about your poem, you've got to relate your confession to someone or something else. Draw a connection between yourself and the reader, or better yet, a surprising connection that makes the reader think "aha!". That being said .  Perhaps you see a bug struggling to get across a deep crack in the sidewalk. Describe the scene in words so that a reader has the feeling of seeing it for themselves. You can even add what the scene reminds you of in your own life.  Poetry is about using as few words as possible, but using "beautiful" words to describe what you are writing about.  Move sections around and see what version has the most impact.  For instance, if you were writing about a bad love affair, a title like "Rotten Apple" might get any readers off in the mood you want.   However, don't add a title just to have one. Many fine poems are listed simply as "Untitled". 

decide what kind of poem you would like to write.  find a source of inspiration such as nature, a strong emotion, a beautiful or engaging image.  come up with one word or topic (from your source of inspiration) and list words or phrases associated with that topic, for example, for "love," red roses, white doves, love letters/poems, light, hope, romance, family/friends, etc.  even in "confessional" or personal poetry, don't just write about emotions.  pay attention to strong or unusual images as you go about your life.  use a thesaurus.  when you've finished your first draft, read it over and see if you've been unnecessarily repetitive.  if you didn't start with a title, read over what you've written and write a title that either introduces, sums up, or perhaps gives a twist on what the poem says.  you have become a "poet"!  

 You can do so by typing "keylogger" into a search engine and reviewing the results. A keylogger is a hidden application that runs in the background of a computer's operating system. While doing so, it makes a note of every single time they type a key, meaning you'll have a log of their usernames and passwords if they visit the pertinent sites., If you don't know where to start, Best Free Keylogger and Revealer Keylogger Free are both safe options.Before downloading software to your computer, try to make sure the website isn't a scam. For around $100, you can buy a critically reviewed keylogger.  You'll want to do this on computer from which you need the password if you can. If you've chosen a paid option instead of a free one, enter your payment information.    Use PayPal for this transaction if at all possible. If you don't download the keylogger directly to the computer on which you need it, you'll end up having to move it to said computer on a USB drive.  To do this, you'll double-click the keylogger setup file and follow the on-screen instructions. More so than most programs, it's very important to read the details of software use and the licensing agreement in your keylogger's installation window when it comes up. You need to make sure you aren't accidentally signing up to have the contents of your keylogger distributed online (or something similarly undesirable).  After the application is running, you'll probably have the option of "hiding" it from view. If you can, hide the application and let it do its job in the background.  Depending on how much use the computer in question gets, you may want to give it up to a week before checking back.   Depending on the keylogger you choose, you may not have to dig through the data that much--some keyloggers list sites' names as they're visited. If you download a simple keylogger that just logs keystrokes, you'll need to search through the data until you find recognizable login information (e.g., a username or phone number).  

search for a keylogger program.  select a reputable keylogger program.  download your selected keylogger.  install the keylogger.  activate the keylogger.  check the keylogger's results. 

 Like kale and other steamed greens, chickweed tastes great with bacon. You could steam it and then add some bacon bits.Enjoy boiled chickweed with bacon. Boil equal portions of chickweed, henbit and lamb’s quarters. Boil them very briefly. Add crumbled bacon and one or two teaspoons of vinegar.  Chickweed is a great addition to a pie. For a chickweed pie, you will need the following ingredients: a 10-inch pie crust; three cups of chopped chickweed; a cup of diced slab bacon; half a cup of chopped onion; three eggs; a cup and a half of sour cream; a tablespoon of flour and half a teaspoon of nutmeg. Make a pie:Preheat the oven to 325 Fahrenheit (162 Celsius) and prepare the pie crust. Rinse, dry and chop the chickweed. Fry the bacon and onions for three minutes and then add them to a bowl with the chickweed. Mix the wet ingredients with the nutmeg. Add the ingredients to the pie shell and bake for between 45 and 50 minutes.  Instead of your usual pesto recipe, try using chickweed. You can make chickweed pesto with two packed cups of freshly chopped chickweed, two cloves of garlic, three Tablespoons of pine nuts, a quarter teaspoon of salt, half a cup of olive oil and half a cup of Parmesan cheese. Blend everything in a cuisinart. You can serve it on pasta., If you are making your favorite quiche or lasagna recipe, you could add some freshly chopped chickweed. For instance, instead of using spinach in your quiche, you could use chickweed. If you are baking a lasagna that calls for a layer of greens, add some chickweed. 

eat it with bacon.  add it to a pie.  try chickweed pesto for your dinner pasta.  add chickweed to quiche or lasagna. 

 An emergency reload is needed when you have spent all the rounds from your magazine and your slide is locked back.; , This happens after the slide has locked back on an empty magazine. , Be sure not to lose your old magazine, and bring your new magazine into place below the magazine well. (they should essentially pass each other during the drill).  Place the rear of the magazine against the rear of the magazine well of the gun, align the two, and with some force (though there should be little resistance).  Give it a light tap, you should feel it click into place.  Be sure not to put your fingers in the slide opening, or anywhere else they might get caught.  This will seat the next round in the chamber, preparing it for discharge.  

identify the need.  grab a fresh magazine (likely from a magazine pouch).  move the fresh magazine toward the gun, as you do this...  ,  eject the empty magazine.  insert the magazine.  seat the magazine using the heel of your palm.  roll your hand over the top of the slide and pull it back toward your chest.  release the slide, so it can go forward with full force. 

   If you have perfectly proportioned hourglass curves, look for a dress that has ruffled trims along the collar, sleeves, and bottom hem to avoid throwing your curves out of proportion. If one area of your body is smaller in proportion than another, look for a dress that places ruffles over that portion. For instance, if you have a small bust and wide hips, look for horizontal ruffles that add volume and detail to your bust.  Some women may be able to pull this look off, but for many, the ruffles are bound to cross over a problem area they would rather mask. If you have a rectangle body type, however, a tiered ruffle dress may provide a welcome increase in volume.  Ruffled dresses can look girlish, but a sultry high heeled sandal may give your look the spice it needs to boost it into womanliness.  Many ruffled dresses have a naturally sweet appearance, and a cute flat or kitten heel can coordinate well with that sweetness without pushing the cuteness over the top.  A ruffled dress may put even more ruffles on your body than a blouse or skirt. Avoid embellishment overkill by sticking with one or two extremely simple pieces of jewelry, like pearl post earrings or a delicate choker necklace.  

use ruffles to balance out your curves.  be careful about ruffles that travel the full length of the dress.  try on a pair of sexy, strappy shoes.  match your ruffled dress with a simple kitten heel or flat.  keep your accessories to a minimum. 

 The contact information for TransUnion, Equifax and Experian can be obtained online at their websites or from the Credit Info Center. The first thing you need to do is know where you are now, in order to fix any errors and determine where you need to improve.The information on the credit report is the data used to develop the credit score, so ensuring the information is correct is critical. You can obtain one free credit report per year from each of the three agencies. Therefore you should request one report every four months so you can continually monitor your reports. Your credit history is free but you may have to pay a small cost to get your actual credit score. Some banks and credit unions offer credit score information to their customers for free.Many services that advertise that they will give you a free credit report or score are scams. They will stand there between you and the credit companies in order to harvest your data and then sell the data to marketing firms. You're considered to be a poor risk if you have a credit score under 620., You will have better luck if you deal directly with the vendor who reported the incorrect information than depending on the credit bureaus to take your word for it. For example, perhaps you paid off a car loan but this was never reported to the bureaus as paid by your bank. The bank should then report the correction.   For other types of reporting errors such as fraudulent use of your identity, provide all the forms of proof that you have to the bureaus, such as cancelled checks, stamped invoices, police reports, etc. Put everything in writing and follow up at least once per week by phone with the bureaus until the mistakes are corrected on your report.If you have some late payments showing on your credit report, these can really hurt your score. Collections, judgments and tax liens are devastating. You can try to negotiate with the entity that reported the collections, etc., for removal of such negative notations. Be aware that unlike what you may have heard or read elsewhere, getting negative information removed from your report is not an easy thing to do. Be persistent, factual and patient.  

request your credit report and score from the three national credit bureaus.  dispute items on your credit report that are incorrect. 

 If you are used to going to bed at midnight, you will certainly have trouble suddenly going to bed at 8 o’clock. Instead, try going to sleep at 11 o’clock, then 10 o’clock, and so on. It can take days or weeks to change your body’s natural rhythm. It’s important to begin adjusting your body a couple weeks before school starts.Give your body and mind plenty of time to adjust. Don’t start trying to adjust your sleep schedule two nights before school starts. You didn’t become a night owl overnight, so don’t expect to become a morning person overnight either! It takes time to reset your internal clock, so start a couple of weeks before the first day of school.; , Different age groups have different sleep requirements. Children from 6 to 13 should be getting 9-11 hours of sleep nightly, while teenagers ages 14-17 need about 8-10 hours. Younger adults age 18-25 are recommended to receive about 7-9 hours., Exercising regularly is a great way to expend energy and ensure you sleep soundly at night. It can also help you fall asleep more quickly. Studies have shown that people who exercise at least 150 minutes a week also feel more alert and energized during their waking hours.Exercising late at night can energize you right before you need to be in bed. Try to work out in the mornings or early afternoons, and relax with more calming hobbies in the evening, such as reading.  Not only can caffeine make it harder for you to fall asleep, but it can also make your sleep disruptive and uneasy. By avoiding caffeine completely, you can get the deep, restorative sleep that will set you up for a successful day. If you don’t want to cut out caffeine completely, at least try to avoid it up to six hours before bedtime., This means everything- phones, tablets, televisions, etc. These devices shine light into your eyes, which has been scientifically proven to promote wakefulness. Just as the sunset signals the end of the day, your electronics should go lights out too. A dark bedroom tells your brain that it is time to sleep., There are also free apps on smart phones that can provide white noise- just make sure the bright screen is off! Your brain craves stimulation, and it can be hard to turn that desire off at night. A white noise machine provides that stimulation, in a gentle and calming way. It also masks any bothersome noises from outside your bedroom that can keep you awake.You can play around with different white noise options such as thunderstorm, campfire, rain forest, and more.  It is not easy to sleep if you are tossing and turning in a hot bedroom. As your body temperature lowers, your brain is told that it’s time to sleep. The best temperature for snoozing is anywhere from 60 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit. If you aren’t in control of the thermostat, a ceiling fan or a portable fan can do the trick. A fan can also provide calming white noise.  Just like you gradually scaled back your bedtime, you should do the same with your wake up time. Make it earlier in one hour increments gradually.   No matter how bad you want to hit snooze, don’t do it! It will only make waking up harder in the long run.  This signals to your brain that it is time to wake up, and will help shake your feelings of grogginess. Open your curtains, turn on your lights, or even step outside. The bright light will perk you up and also can benefit your overall mood., It’s a pretty simple chore, yet so many people skip it. Not only does it start your day with a feeling of accomplishment, but it is much harder to crawl back into a neatly made bed. Do this enough, and it’ll become a habit.  Your body can become dehydrated overnight, and this dehydration can increase your tiredness in the morning. By drinking a large glass of water first thing in the morning, you can restore some of the hydration you lost overnight and give yourself a quick, and easy, energy boost. Cold water can also increase adrenaline, which helps to wake you up., If you’re surrounded by silence, it’s easy (and appealing) to fall back asleep. You don’t need to play the peppiest music you can think of as loud as you possibly can. Just put on some music with upbeat melodies and positive lyrics, and it'll help you transition from zombie to human.Make a "Rise & Shine" playlist on your phone to pop on during your early mornings.  If your blood sugar is low, your energy is low too. By eating a hearty meal in the morning, you are “breaking fast” and giving your body an energy boost in the morning.Try to eat healthy, nutrient-dense foods to promote stable energy levels. Sugary cereals and pastries may sound appealing, but they can cause a crash after the initial surge of energy., Get your body moving in the morning, however you can. If you have time to exercise in the morning, that’s great. If you don’t have time for a full workout, some gentle stretching can do the trick. By moving around and stretching out your body, you get your heart pumping and blood flowing to your brain.You may also get a burst of endorphins, the “feel good” chemicals that are released during physical exercise., It is normal to feel sleepy and lethargic while your body gradually gets used to your new schedule. However no matter how groggy you feel, don’t let yourself nap. Sleeping during the day will make it harder for you to fall asleep at night, and you’ll undo the hard work you did by waking up early. 

scale your bedtime back gradually.  determine how much sleep you need.  exercise daily.  avoid caffeine as you begin your new sleeping schedule.  keep electronics out of your bedroom.  invest in a white noise machine.  lower the thermostat.  set your alarm earlier and earlier each day.  expose yourself to bright light right when you awaken.  make your bed as soon as you wake up.  drink a big glass of water.  put on some music.  eat breakfast.  stretch.  refuse naps during the day. 

 These spots often result from high amounts of skin-darkening melanin in certain areas of your skin. This melanin can be set off by triggers from inside and outside your body. This melanin condition is called hyperpigmentation. The triggers might include sun exposure, melasma, and skin inflammation.   Sun spots: These dark brown clusters can take months, or even years, to show up in sun-exposed areas. Once they show up, they usually don't fade unless you treat them. This pigment shift stays near the surface of the skin, so you can treat it with creams and scrubs. Use sunscreen often to prevent sun spots or to keep them from getting worse. Melasma (Chloasma): These dusky, symmetrical spots stem from hormone changes during birth-control use or pregnancy. When these hormones combine with sun exposure, dark spots can appear on the cheeks, forehead, and upper lip. This form of hyperpigmentation tends to return easily, even if you treat it. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation: If you have a darker skin tone, you may get dark spots that linger after a burn, pimple, or other skin abrasion. In this case, the melanin is deep within your skin, and the dark spots may take three to six months to fade.; , The skin around your mouth is drier during cold season. Some people tend to wet that area with their saliva, which can darken the skin. If you haven't been out in the sun much, you may be over-wetting the area around your mouth., This can lead to discoloration, dry skin, and mouth wrinkles. These problems do not go deep into the skin, so you will probably not need an invasive treatment. You may be able to easily get rid of your discoloration by treating or exfoliating the skin.  If you aren't sure what's causing the dark area around your mouth, a dermatologist may be able to diagnose the problem and suggest a treatment. Changes in the skin can be early warning signs of skin cancer and other serious disorders, so it might be wise to have a doctor check out your symptoms just in case.  

understand why you have dark spots around your mouth.  consider the climate.  know that the skin around your mouth is thin.  see a dermatologist. 

 String and bait catching is a simple way of catching crawfish and makes for a fun family activity. All you need is a fishing pole, rod or stick, some fishing line or string, and some bait.   You can attach the bait to the string using a fish hook or even a safety pin - this will ensure that the bait remains attached to the string and prevents the crawfish from getting away. Lower the bait into the water and wait patiently until you feel a tug on the end of the string. Then slowly move the crawfish and bait as close to the shore as possible before gently pulling it out of the water. Immediately place the crawfish into a bucket. If you like, you can use a fishnet with a long handle to scoop up the crawfish as soon as your reel them in. This will prevent them from releasing the bait and getting away.; , Traps are the best way to catch large quantities of crawfish with relatively little effort. So if you want to feed your friends and family a crawfish feast, this is the way to go.   There are two main types of traps: open traps, which are basically collapsible nets that are open on one end, and closed traps, a more advanced variety with a funnel on one end which allows the crawfish to enter the trap, but prevents them from escaping. Avoid using square-shaped traps as these can catch on rocks at the bottom of the water and become trapped or broken. Cylindrical-, conical- and beehive-shaped traps are all better options. Crawfish traps should be less than three feet in height, width and depth.Before you lower the traps into the water, you will need to bait them. Some traps have a hook in the center to which you can attach the bait, while other require the use of bait boxes or bait jars. Open traps can be left in the water for several hours at a time, as long as there is enough bait, while closed traps can be left overnight. With any luck, when you pull the trap up again it will be filled with crawfish. Under the right conditions, you can catch 15 to 20 pounds of crawfish per trap!, A third option for catching crawfish is just to catch them by hand, as they are often found amongst the rocks in shallow pools and can easily be picked up -- just watch out for those sharp claws!   To catch a crawfish by hand, you will need to find a pond, creek or lake that is well known for its crawfish population. Crawfish typically like to hide under rocks and plants in the shallow parts of the water. To catch a crawfish, wade into the water and look for rocks that seem likely to be hiding a crawfish. Then very slowly reach your hand into the water and gently lift up the rock. If you lift it too quickly it can startle the crawfish and stir up mud which obstructs your vision, allowing the crawfish to scurry away. If you lift the rock correctly, you should see a crawfish just sitting underwater. Now you have two options. The first option is just to pick the crawfish up with your bare hands. If it's very small, you can reach your hands into the water and cup it between both hands. If it's larger, you can pick it up using the thumb and forefinger of one hand, just behind the pinchers. Your second option is to use a small bucket and stick. Gently place the bucket 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) behind the crawfish, then wave the stick in front of it or give it a light tap. Crawfish swim backwards, so it should swim directly into the bucket. Once it's in there, scoop the bucket out of the water.Whatever you do, don't blindly thrust your hand into the water, or you could get a nasty pinch!  , In many states, a fishing license is required to catch crawfish. However once this license is acquired, you can catch as many crawfish as you like, 365 days a year.   Family fishing licenses (which entitles any member of the family to fish) are available for purchase at your local state department, for a fee of approximately $60. When using crawfish traps, the license number must be engraved on or attached to the trap, along with your name and address., Crawfish are most active during the warmer months of the year, so the best time to go fishing for them is between April and October. However, it is still possible to catch crawfish during the colder months, just don't expect to find as many.  Crawfish are freshwater crustaceans and can be found in many bodies of water across the U.S.A. and in countries around the world.   They make their homes in streams, ponds and lakes, in addition to canals, reservoirs, springs and bedrock pools. Most crawfish seem to prefer still or slow-moving water, with plenty of rocks and vegetation to provide cover.  Crawfish are nocturnal, which means they are most active at night, especially in warmer waters or during the summer months. Therefore, many people will set out to catch crawfish at dusk, or will leave traps in the water overnight and collect them in the morning.   If you plan on leaving traps in the water overnight, make sure to attach a piece of string tied around a cork. This will allow you to find the traps easily in the light of day. However, crawfish can still be tempted by bait during the day, so catching them during daylight hours is not impossible. Go fishing at whatever time works for you. Just remember that nighttime crawfishing expeditions can be a lot of fun!  , The best bait to use for crawfishing is widely debated, however most sources will agree that you can't go wrong with the heads, tails and guts of oily fish which are native to the local area.   Fish like salmon, herring, carp, perch, walleye and trout all work well as crawfish bait, but things like sardines, squid, clams, sole and eel will not. Other options include any kind of fatty, raw meat such as chicken or pork. Crawfish are also attracted to pieces of hot dog and even fish-based cat food (though some crawfish experts would disagree with this). The most important thing when it comes to bait is that the meat is fresh. Crawfish will not be attracted to old, spoiled or smelly meat, contrary to popular belief., When you are using traps to catch crawfish, it is essential that the bait is properly secured.   With some basic traps, the bait is simply hung from a hook in the center of the trap. This works well, but if the traps are left underwater for too long, the crawfish will eat all of the bait, then lose interest and escape from the trap. Therefore, many crawfish experts recommend using bait boxes - these allow the crawfish to feed and enable the smell of the bait to disperse through the water, attracting more crawfish. But because the bait is less accessible, it will not be eaten as quickly, so the crawfish remain in the trap for longer. Another option is bait jars - these allow the smell of the bait to disperse through the water, but do not allow the crawfish to feed. The bait will last for longer, but the crawfish are not as likely to stay in the trap once they realize that they cannot feed.  Crawfish contain a delicious sweet white meat which can be eaten on its own or used in a variety of southern-style dishes such as crawfish jambalaya, crawfish etouffee and crawfish bisque. Crawfish can also replace other shellfish such as lobster and crab in most dishes.   First, kill the crawfish by thrusting a sharp knife between the head and thorax, or by submerging them in ice or boiling water for several minutes. To cook them, boil a pot of plain water and add some salt, black pepper and cayenne for authentic Acadian seasoning. Rinse any mud or debris off the crawfish with clean water. If you wish to purge the vein inside the crawfish (intestines) before cooking, mix half a cup of salt or white vinegar with a bucket of clean water and leave the crawfish to soak in it for 30 minutes. When the water turns murky, they are ready to cook. Place the whole crawfish (or just the tails and large claws) into the pot of boiling water and leave for approximately 5 minutes, or until the shells turn bright red. If you like, you can add additional ingredients to the water such as seafood boil, onions, jalapenos or cilantro. Eat the crawfish on their own, dipped in butter and lemon juice or covered in cocktail sauce. Serve with corn on the cob and boiled potatoes for a hearty post-fishing lunch or dinner. , Some people like to keep crawfish as pets, as they are easy to care for and are fascinating for children to watch. Sometimes they can even be brought to school and kept as a classroom pet!   Transport the crawfish by keeping them somewhere damp and cool. Do not place the crawfish in a bucket of water as most species need to oxygen to survive and will die in stagnant water. As long as the crawfish is kept moist, it can survive out of water for several days. Keep the crawfish in an oxygenated aquarium on its own, as it will eat other fish. It can feed off any vegetation you place in the aquarium or you can feed it fish heads and trimmings, fatty meats or any of the bait described above. Be aware that some states forbid people from taking live crawfish away from their capture site. Some states (such as Arizona) forbid people from taking live crawfish home - they must be killed at the site of capture. So if you are considering bringing a crawfish home for a pet, make sure to look up your state's regulations first.

 Setting the movie aside for the moment, think of the riddle in its most basic terms. What do you know, what's your goal, and what are your options? A simpler way to look at the riddle might be: You have two empty water jugs in your hands. One holds 3 gallons of water, the other holds 5 gallons of water. You need to use these two jugs to measure exactly 4 gallons of water. You have an unlimited amount of water to do so.    ; , In order to measure out your 4 gallons, you need to put it somewhere. As John McClane rightly deduces, you couldn't possibly fit it in the 3-gallon jug, which means the right answer must involve getting the right amount of water in the 5-gallon jug.  The solution does not involve bringing in another jug, or eyeballing the water levels perfectly, or finding fractions of jugs. You have two jugs and an unlimited supply of water. How can you use just those things to get to 4 gallons? More specifically, how can you use 3 and 5 to get to 4?   Unlimited water means you can use or pour out as much as you want. You are not able to guess exactly how much water is in the jug unless you fill it all the way up.  Ignore the water and the jugs for a moment if you are still stuck. How can you add or subtract 3's and 5's to get to 4? This is really all you are doing; the numbers just happen to represent gallons. Adding water or dumping it out is really just addition and subtraction.  

simplify the question and your options.  determine where you will keep the 4 gallons of water.  know that, like all good riddles, you have everything you need for a solution.  realize that this is, at heart, a simple math problem.

 Conjunctivitis can occur due to viruses, bacteria, and allergies. All types of pink eye cause the eyes to become red, watery, and itchy, but the other symptoms of pink eye will vary according to its cause.Viral can affect one or both eyes, and individuals with this condition may experience sensitivity to light. Viral conjunctivitis is highly contagious and difficult to treat. It usually needs to run its course, which can take anywhere from one to three weeks. The best way to treat viral conjunctivitis is by preventing complications from arising. Bacterial conjunctivitis causes a sticky discharge, yellow or green, located in the corner of the eye. In extreme cases, the discharge can cause the eyes to stick together. One or both eyes can be affected, and bacterial conjunctivitis is contagious. Bacterial conjunctivitis is best treated by a doctor. You might be able to overcome the illness at home, but antibiotics will significantly shorten the duration. Allergic conjunctivitis is usually accompanied by other allergy symptoms, including a stuffy or runny nose, and both eyes will be affected. It is not contagious. Allergic conjunctivitis is usually treated at home, but patients with severe allergies may need professional medical treatment to clear the condition up quickly.; , It never hurts to call the doctor when you have pink eye, since your doctor will have good recommendations for what to do. A call is strongly recommended if the pink eye is accompanied by more worrisome symptoms.Call the doctor if you experience moderate to severe pain in the eye or if you experience vision problems that do not clear up once the discharge is wiped away. If pink eye deepens in color to an intense red, you should seek medical help as soon as possible. Contact the doctor immediately if you suspect that you have a severe form of viral conjunctivitis, such as one caused by the herpes simplex virus, or if you are immuno-compromised due to HIV infection or cancer treatment. Contact your doctor if bacterial conjunctivitis being treated with antibiotics does not improve after 24 hours.  For mild allergic conjunctivitis, an oral over-the-counter allergy medication may be enough to clear your symptoms within several hours to a few days. If it doesn't go away quickly, it's probably bacterial or viral.   Try an antihistamine. The body reacts to allergens by producing chemicals called histamines, and these chemicals are the culprit behind pink eye and other allergy symptoms. An antihistamine reduces these levels or blocks the histamines completely, thereby stopping your symptoms.Use a decongestant. While decongestants do not stop the allergen from affecting you, they do control inflammation. In doing so, they can help prevent eye tissue from getting inflamed.    Wipe the eye starting at the inside corner, next to the nose. Gently pass over the entire eye toward the outside corner of the eye. This wipes the discharge away from your tear ducts and safely out of your eye. Wash your hands before and after cleaning your eyes. Use a clean surface for each wipe or pass to avoid getting discharge back in the eye. Immediately discard tissues or disposable eye wipes. Toss any washcloths into the laundry immediately after use. "Artificial tears" can relieve symptoms and flush the eye out.   Most over-the-counter eye drops are mild saline lubricants designed to replace tears. They can soothe dryness associated with pink eye, and they can also wash the eye of contaminants that could complicate and prolong viral, bacterial, or allergic conjunctivitis. Some over-the-counter eye drops also contain anti-histamines that are useful in treating allergic conjunctivitis.  Soak a soft, clean, lint-free cloth in water. Wring it out to remove excess water and apply it to closed eyes using gentle pressure.   Cold compresses are usually best for allergic conjunctivitis, but warm compresses might feel better and reduce swelling in the even of viral or bacterial conjunctivitis. Note that warm compresses do increase the risk of spreading the infection from one eye to the other, so you should use a clean compress for each application and a different compress for each eye.  If you wear contacts, you should remove them for the duration of your pink eye. Contacts can irritate your eyes, causing further complications, and may trap bacteria causing bacterial conjunctivitis in your eye.   Disposable contacts might need to be discarded if they were used at all while you had bacterial or viral conjunctivitis. Non-disposable contacts should be cleansed thoroughly before you reuse them.  Viral and bacterial conjunctivitis are both contagious, and you can be reinfected after becoming well if the illness has spread to other members of your household.   Do not touch your eyes with your hands. If you do touch your eyes or your face, wash your hands immediately afterward. Also, wash your hands after applying eye medication. Use a clean washcloth and towel every day. Change your pillowcases daily for the duration of the infection. Do not share any products that touch your eye. This includes eye drops, towels, linens, eye cosmetics, contacts, lens solutions or containers, or handkerchiefs. Do not use eye cosmetics until you get rid of the pink eye completely. Otherwise, you could reinfect yourself with those cosmetics. If any eye make-up was used when you had pink eye, discard it. Stay away from school or work for a few days. Most people with viral conjunctivitis can return after 3 to 5 days, once symptoms start to improve. Most people with bacterial conjunctivitis return after symptoms vanish or 24 hours after treating the symptoms with an antibiotic.  While over-the-counter eye drops are effective for many people suffering with pink eye, prescription eye drops are more powerful and may rid you of the illness sooner.   Treat bacterial conjunctivitis with antibiotic eye drops.Antibiotic eye drops are a topical treatment that attacks the bacteria directly. They usually clear the infection within several days, but you should notice improvement after the first 24 hours. Follow your doctor's instructions concerning application. Treat allergic conjunctivitis with antihistamine or steroid eye drops. While some antihistamine eye drops can be purchased over-the-counter, stronger versions are available by prescription. Severe allergies are sometimes treated with eye drops containing steroids, as well.  Antibiotic ointment is easier to apply than eye drops are, especially for children.   Note the ointment blurs vision for 20 minutes after being applied, but the patient's vision should clear up after that time passes. Bacterial conjunctivitis should be gone after a few days with use of this treatment.  If your doctor suspects that your viral conjunctivitis is caused by the herpes simplex virus, he may decide to put you on some form of antiviral medication.   Antiviral medications may also be an option if you have certain preexisting health conditions that have weakened your immune system.  

determine which kind of pink eye you have.  know when to call the doctor.  try allergy medicine.  clean the infected eye regularly.whenever drainage begins to build in your eye, you need to wipe it away to prevent bacteria from festering.  apply over-the-counter eye drops.  use a cold or warm compress.  remove your contacts.  prevent the condition from spreading.  use prescription eye drops.  try an antibiotic eye ointment.  ask about antiviral medications. 

 Put a banana, figs, papayas, or another fruit into a food processor and pulse until you have a somewhat smooth consistency. You can bake the fruits for a bit beforehand, if you choose. Add this fruit puree into your recipes as a replacement for sugar. If a recipe calls for 1 cup of sugar, you can use ½ cup puree., Get an assortment of dried fruits and then use a sharp knife to dice them into tiny bits. Add these pieces into a baked recipe or sprinkle them on top of a non-sweet food, such as oatmeal, in place of a few tablespoons of sugar. They will provide a punch of sweetness with more nutrients., You can press your own juice or you can buy a 100% juice from a store. If you buy from a store, make sure that your product contains no added sweeteners. Be careful when adding juice to a recipe as it can impact the cooking time and consistency of the final product. A ratio of ¾ cup juice for every 1 cup of sugar is usually a good place to start.You can also use juice concentrate directly from a can. If you are looking for a more syrupy texture, try boiling the juice until it loses around 30% of its water content.If you like to drink fruit juice, limit intake to 4 ounces a day to moderate your sugar intake.  If you squeeze your own fresh juice, then make sure to save the leftover pulp. Or, get a zester and run a few oranges or limes over it, creating some aromatic shavings. You can think sprinkle the pulp or shaving on top of bland foods, such as yogurts. Adding pulp or shavings into a baked good will also enhance the flavor without requiring any baking or liquid modifications., Purchase or make your own jam or jelly. Take a knife and spread it on top of foods that taste good with a bit of additional sugar, such as waffles or whole-grain toast. Make sure to use jelly sparingly, however, as it will still have a high sugar content. To avoid this, you can also simply mash a fruit, such as a ripe banana, until it becomes spreadable.To give your jam or jelly an extra kick, mix in a spice, such as vanilla or cinnamon.  If you enjoy sweet drinks, but are avoiding them due to their sugar content, then you might use fruit as an alternative sweetener. Slice up watermelon or lemons and place them into your water glass. Mash up some berries and put them in a pitcher, letting this mixture sit overnight.Try sparkling water for a refreshing twist, too.  

make a fruit puree.  chop the fruit into pieces.  stir in fruit juice.  add in fruit pulp or zest.  apply a fruit spread.  stir fruit into drinks. 

 The Perfect cut equals the Perfect Outfit. Above all, cut is the most vital element of your look. If possible, imitate the French women and have all your staple items tailored. If you cannot afford tailoring, be ruthless when shopping. Only purchase pieces that fit you perfectly--belts that hug your hips, fitted waistlines and shoulders. Keep in mind that the most beautiful silhouette is clean, simple with graceful lines.; , Seek out pure shades rather than "in-between" tones. Black is always lovely and white, navy, charcoal and true red are other desirable shades. If these colours do not attract you, do not be afraid to experiment with less conventional tones. However, be sure that your choice does not detract or distract from the innate beauty of the garment; the grace of its lines, the perfection of its design.  However, exercise caution as prints can also be distracting. Choose a print that is neither too "loud" or too "busy". Tasteful, original floral designs are lovely as are bold, geometric patterns. Let your instincts guide you but remember: the simpler, the better.  Do not settle for any inferior fabrics as the simplicity of classic clothes will certainly make this obvious. The beauty of a garment lies very much in the beauty of the materials used. Consider the different "characters" of various materials, how they look in different lights. A little black dress in wool has an immensely different feel to a little black dress in lace. The following are examples of "Classic" fabrics; silk, cashmere, good quality wool, lace, cotton, chiffon, corduroy. Fur is the best choice if you are looking to add a touch of luxury. If you are conscientious about wearing real fur, be sure to purchase a high quality faux substitute.  While it is true that cut and material create a beautiful outfit, it is drama that captures and intrigues. Wear your classic items with irony: defy some traditional proportion (wear a trench coat over a short dress), wear an unexpected colour, add a taste of tackiness with patent leather or fake jewelry. Above all, allow a fascinating glimmer of your soul to shine through. Always be sure, however, to consider all your choices in the light of good taste and make beauty a priority.  Choose tasteful jewelry and keep your accessories to bare necessity. Avoid gaudy, bright designs unless you are making a statement. The most beautiful jewelry is simple, often traditional and architectural. Fresh flowers are also very attractive especially when pinned in the hair on on the lapel.  Shoes must be elegant in shape, simple and tasteful. Steer away from shoes that are gaudy, highly decorated or overtly unconventional. Look instead for small details of heel shape, stitching, colour and material. Likewise, bags should be simple in design, monochromatic and embellished with little hardware.  Be sure that you are comfortable in the unique fit of your clothes and the reaction of the fabrics with your body. Study how your outfits moves with your moving body--is the effect graceful?  

look for the perfect cut.  remember, for a classic look, colour will be your main medium.  experiment with prints; they can be beautiful paired with minimalist pieces.  always remember the first rule of classic style: the quality of your material is paramount.  use drama as your weapon.  use accessories to enhance beauty.  use your shoes and handbag to pull your outfit together.  do not sacrifice comfort.

 Although a Repair Install should not affect any of your data, it is always good to be prepared in case something goes wrong. Back up your essential files to an external drive, CD/DVD, or another form of storage.   Make sure to get files from all of the possible locations, including My Documents, Desktop, and any other folders you may have created and placed files in. You should also track down your Windows Product Key in case you end up needing to do a complete reinstall. Your Product Key is typically located on the case that the Windows disc came in, or on a sticker affixed to your computer.; , If you bought your computer from a manufacturer such as Dell, you may have a recovery disc instead of a Windows XP disc. Close out of the program that autoruns when you insert the disc.  With the disc inserted, restart your computer. As the computer boots up, press the Setup key to enter your BIOS. The key varies from system to system, and will be displayed beneath the manufacturer's logo. Common keys include: F2, F10, F12, and Delete.   If Windows begins to load, the Setup key was not pressed in time and you will have to retry.  Once you've entered the BIOS, navigate to the BOOT menu. It may be labeled slightly differently depending on your specific BIOS. You will need to change the boot order so that your CD/DVD drive is the first boot device, followed by your hard drive.   Normally, the hard drive is the primary boot device. This means that the system attempts to boot from the hard disk first, loading your installed copy of Windows. You want to change it so that it attempts to boot from your Windows disc before trying the hard drive. Once you've changed your boot order, save your changes and restart your computer.  After you computer reboots again, you will see the message Press any key to boot from CD.... Press any key on you keyboard to start the Windows setup program.   Setup will load the files necessary to install Windows. This may take a few moments.  When the setup program first loads, you will be greeted with a Welcome message. At the bottom of the screen, you will see keys that you can press to navigate the options. DO NOT press the key for Repair; instead press Enter to continue.   Press F8 to agree to the Windows License Agreement.  After the license agreement, you will see a list of your drives. One of them should be labeled "Windows" and will usually be highlighted automatically. The only time you will need to manually select it is if you have multiple operating systems installed.  Once you have your copy highlighted, press R to start the Repair process. Windows will begin deleting system files. After the system files are deleted, fresh copies will be installed.   No personal files should be deleted during the repair.  During the reinstallation, you will need to select your Region and Language options. You will also need to set your network settings. Most users can choose the first option, "No, this computer is not on a network, or is on a network without a domain."  , Once you've entered your preferences, you'll need to wait a few more minutes for Windows to finish copying necessary files. Your computer will likely reboot during this process.  After installation is complete and your computer reboots, you will be asked if you would like to register with Microsoft. This is not the same as activation, and is completely optional. After that, you will be asked to create your user name and any other user names for people using the computer. You can add and remove users later if you wish.  After setup is complete, you will be taken to your Windows XP desktop. The repair installation reverted Windows back to its initial state, which means any updates, patches, and service packs that were installed have been removed. You need to update your computer as soon as possible to ensure that you are protected from threats.  If your problem has been fixed, then your repair installation most likely worked. If you are still experiencing problems though, you may need to take your repair efforts further and perform a completely clean install. This will involve wiping your hard drive of all data and starting over from scratch. See this guide for detailed instruction on performing a clean installation.With Microsoft ending all support for Windows XP in April 2014, this might be the perfect time for an upgrade. See this guide for upgrading to Windows 7 and this guide for upgrading to Windows 8.  

backup your data.  insert your windows xp setup disc.  reboot the computer and enter the bios.  change your boot order.  start the installation.  navigate to the repair installation option.  select your copy of windows.  start the repair.  set your preferences.  wait for setup to finish.  create your user names.  update windows.  continue troubleshooting. 

 Not knowing the causes and risk factors of an illness often leads to exposure to those factors. Ask your doctor to help you develop a better understanding of the disease and how to avoid it.Know the statistics. Age, weight, genetics, and other cancers are all factors in contracting cancer, so compare your own profile with that of the high-risk candidate. For example, women over 50 are at the most risk of getting uterine cancer, while overweight women are also more likely candidates for uterine cancer.Other factors considered to increase one's risk are: nulliparity (never giving birth), unopposed estrogen therapy (if you still have a uterus), early onset of menses, late menopause, PCOS, a history of anovulation, obesity and excessive weight, diabetes or related issues, and exposure to certain medical chemicals like Estrogen replacements. If you started menstruation early or experienced a late menopause, you have a higher risk of uterine cancer. This is because the longer one menstruates, the longer one is exposed to relatively high levels of estrogen., Early detection is one of the most effective tools in treating cancer, so plan to see your doctor every one to two years for checkups. Also, talk with your doctor if you notice any bleeding after menopause or if you have irregular periods.   Keep track of any irregular or abnormal vaginal bleeding and tell your doctor about any symptoms you are having when you go for appointments. Review test results with your doctor to ensure that you understand everything. Make a special medical calendar and hang it in a prominent place so that you won’t miss your appointments.  Estrogen is only a risk factor for uterine cancer if it is given without progesterone. Talk to your doctor about any concerns you have before undergoing a postmenopausal hormone regimen.The breast cancer medication Tamoxifen has also been linked to uterine cancer, but the general consensus of the medical community regarding this drug determines that its benefits largely outweigh its potential risks., Women who have or might have hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) have a substantially increased likelihood of contracting uterine cancer. If you or family members have had colon or endometrial cancer before, you should consider getting genetic counseling to test for the genetic mutation dictating HNPCC.Cowden syndrome and BRCA1 may also raise your risk of uterine cancer.  

educate yourself on the potential causes of uterine cancer.  schedule regular appointments.  consider postmenopausal hormone treatments.  evaluate your options regarding genetic testing.

 Animal Crossing can be a demanding game. If you do not visit regularly, weeds will take over your town’s landscape and citizens will wonder where you’ve been.   Furthermore, if you aren’t playing regularly, then you will miss opportunities to make your town better.  Time functions in the game Animal Crossing in the same way that it does for you. This means that if your 3DS is set to the current time and date, then that is the time and date that it will be in your town.   If your 3DS is set to a different time and date, then your Animal Crossing town will be set to that date instead.  10 to 15 minutes should be plenty of time to keep your town well maintained each day. During that time, you should try to pull weeds and talk with all of your citizens.   Talking to your citizens is covered in Method 1, while gardening is covered in Methods 2 and 3.  

understand that your town requires regular maintenance.  be aware that your animal crossing town has the same time and date as your real life does.  try to spend at least 10 or 15 minutes a day maintaining your town. 

 When a person is on the verge of a mental breakdown the number of cells in the region of the brain called hippocampus get fewer and fewer. But, when a body is exposed to physical exercise the number of cells in the hippocampus goes up. What’s more, the levels of endorphins (feel good hormones) increases, too.Exercise produces endorphins and restricts the release of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline which are often responsible for a mental breakdown. When you are involved in physical activity your focus tends to shift away from tasks, events and situations that are creating stress in you, which provides time for your mind to recover from stress.  When you are in a high state of stress, you may experience sleep-related problems, including insomnia. A lack of sleep will make stress even worse and could lead to a mental breakdown.Try to get at least 7 hours of quality sleep every night. Sleep needs vary from person to person, so you may need more or less sleep depending on your activity level, age, and other factors.  Sometimes stress may be aggravated by medical conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies. Common vitamin deficiencies include vitamin D, B6, and B12. Being deficient in these nutrients could add to your stress and lead to a mental breakdown.If you have not had an appointment with your doctor in a while, schedule a routine check-up to make sure that you are healthy and that you are getting all of the nutrients you need to stay healthy.  Amino acids play a crucial role in controlling the symptoms caused by stress and depression thus preventing the progress towards mental breakdown Amino acids make up most of the neurotransmitters in the brain, so they are essential for mental health. The basic structure of proteins is composed of amino acids.To enjoy the benefits of amino acids, follow a diet rich in proteins such as milk, dairy products, eggs, poultry, meat, peas, beans, legumes and grains. Dopamine is a product of an amino acid called tyrosine while serotonin a product of tryptophan. Insufficient synthesis of neurotransmitters in the brain is associated with bad mood and mood swings. This holds greater significance if the transmitters are dopamine and serotonin.  A high intake of sugar can promote inflammation in the body that in turn disturbs the normal functioning of the brain. Processed foods like candy, cookies, sodas, and others tend to have the most sugar. Steer clear of these types of foods as much as you can to reduce inflammation.High intake of sugar and carbohydrates leads to excessive release of insulin that can also trigger hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia in turn causes the brain to release glutamate in the brain in levels that are both alarming and that can cause symptoms that are indicative of mental breakdown such as anxiety, depression, panic attacks  , Both forms of carbohydrates boost the levels of serotonin (a brain calming and mood enhancing hormone) but with complex carbs (whole grain bread, cereals) the process is gradual and consistent because they are digested slowly. Simple carbs (sweets, candy, soda) which are rich in sugars are digested easily, which results in a spike followed by a crash in serotonin.Avoid or limit foods such as processed foods and foods rich in sugars and gluten. They can be dangerous to an already stressed body and may speed up the process of mental breakdown  , A deficiency in folic acid may also contribute to a stress response. Please be aware that a folic acid deficiency can only be diagnosed by a physician, and any supplements taken should be under a physician’s direction and supervision. A folic acid deficiency may lead to neurological problems such as depression. Having an adequate amount of folic acid in the body also improves the effectiveness of antidepressants.To get more folic acid from food, include spinach and citrus fruits, like oranges, in your diet.  Foods with B-vitamins help to shield you against depression and mental breakdowns. B complex vitamins and especially B1, B2 and B6 vitamins show promising results when it comes to improving mood. Foods rich in B-vitamins include:Dark leafy green vegetables Red meat whole grains, wheat germ, Green peas Lentils, nuts such as pecans and almonds, milk, yogurt, cheese, poultry, fish, eggs, legumes, peanuts, seafood, bananas, potatoes  , There is ample research to show that zinc levels are often quite low in people who show symptoms of stress, depression, or who are on the verge of a mental breakdown. Also having an adequate amount of zinc in your body either through diet or oral supplements can improve the effectiveness of any medications that you take for depression and other mental related problems. Foods rich in zinc include:seafood nuts wheat germ pumpkin seeds spinach mushrooms beans meat  , Iodine, Iron and chromium play a very important role in preventing mental breakdown. Deficiency in these vital minerals may lead to fatigue, depression, and mood swings.Foods rich in Iron: red meat, dark leafy green vegetables, egg yolks, dried fruits (raisins, prunes), poultry, beans, lentils, artichokes Foods rich in iodine: cow’s milk, yogurt, strawberry, sea vegetables, eggs, soy milk, saltwater fish and cheese Foods rich in chromium: whole grains, meat, brown rice, seafood, broccoli, mushrooms, beans, dairy products, eggs, cheese, milk, poultry, corn, potatoes, fish, tomatoes, barley, oats, herbs  

exercise to help your body create stress-reducing endorphins.  get plenty of sleep each night.  schedule regular check-ups to make sure that you are not deficient in any nutrients.  eat amino acids to keep your mental health strong.  keep tabs on your sugar and processed food intake.  choose complex carbs over simple carbs.  up your intake of folic acid.  try eating more b-vitamin foods.  get more zinc to stay stress-free.  eat foods rich in iron, iodine, and chromium. 

 Make sure the bowl is clean and hasn't been sitting out in the sun all day--bacteria can grow in their bowl if you don't wash it and provide fresh water. Don't try to force or pour water into your dog's mouth, even if he refuses to drink, as he will likely just suck it into his lungs and choke.If your dog won't drink, try wetting his tongue with water. You can use your hand or squeeze water from a cloth and onto his tongue. Don't give your dog ice water or ice if you think he is overheated. This can actually cool him down too quickly and shock his system., Get him indoors as soon as possible. If you are outdoors and can pick your dog up, carry him back to your car or house. If there is a pond or stream nearby, allow him to stand in the water and cool down a little before heading back.At the very least, try to get your dog into a shady spot.   Try to get your dog someplace with air conditioning or fans that you can position to blow on him.Once he is removed from the heat, evaluate his symptoms and call your veterinarian. It may be necessary to bring him in for emergency treatment.  Don't ice ice or icepacks--you need to bring her temperature down gradually. If you lower her temperature too quickly or it falls too low, it could be just as dangerous as overheating.If you don't have towels, you can cool her by pouring room temperature water on her body.Wet her ear flaps and her paw pads. Most of a dog's sweat glands are in her paws, and cooling these down may help lower her temperature.You can also try evaporative cooling by rubbing her footpads and groin with isopropyl alcohol.Evaporative cooling works using the same principles as sweating--as the alcohol evaporates, it removes the heat from your dog's body. 

give your dog access to plenty of fresh, cool water.  remove your dog from the heat.  cool your dog down by draping cool, wet towels over her neck, under her forelimbs (in her armpits) and between her hind legs (around her groin).these towels should be cool, not cold. 

 Commonly available in outdoors, craft, and home repair stores, grommet kits are available to reinforce holes in fabric, usually in the neighborhood of 5 dollars. The kit will include:  Grommets Washers A base to stabilize the grommets as you install A grommet hole punch Some larger kits will include grommet pliers, which are used to pinch the grommets into placeAdditionally, you'll need a hammer and scissors for the job; , The hole punch included is usually just a small metal cylinder with the correct diameter for the grommet. To punch a hole, you'll hammer the punch into the fabric to start a hole that you can finish with scissors.  Flatten your fabric over a stable surface (a spare piece of scrap wood or a workbench is appropriate) and hold the punch in place as you would a nail, where you'd like the grommet and hole to go. Give a few sharp taps with the hammer. If you can't punch straight through with the punch included, make a small X in the hole outline you've created with an X-acto or fabric knife, and cut the inside of the circle out.If you're installing lots of grommets (like in a home made shower curtain or tarp) make sure you go around the edge and measure the distance between the grommets before you go punching holes.  A grommet kit should consist of two varieties of pieces that will snap together to create each grommet. Get one of each and compare them. One will have a raised inner edge and will look taller than the other half, and you should insert this end into the bottom of the fabric, facing up.  Place the other half of the grommet on top of the raised edge on the other side of the fabric.  If you've got grommet pliers, all you need to do is ensure that both sides are aligned properly and use the pliers to snap both sides of the grommet together.If your kit came with a base (a small, nipple-shaped metal platform) then you should use the base to stabilize the grommet as you hammer it together. It shouldn't take much more than a single good whack with the hammer.  

purchase a grommet kit.  punch a hole in your fabric.  insert the grommet with the raised end.  snap the grommet together. 

 Having a high vertical jump will enable you to be a more formidable player, giving you an advantage over your opponent. Achieve high jumping with plyometrics, which are movements that are completed with a lot of force very quickly.Measuring your current jump height will give you a good indication of how much you are improving. To measure your height:   Ask someone to observe you. Jump up as high as you can next to a wall while reaching your arms upward. Have your observer mark on the wall how high you jumped and measure the height. You can also put a bit of chalk on your hands. As you jump up against a wall, extend your arm upward and touch the wall at the highest point you can reach. Measure that height.  Use a surface that is about 2 feet off the ground, such as a jump box or bench. Face the box and jump on it with both feet landing flat and balanced. Do 3 sets of 20 repetitions every day. When this height becomes easy for you, add more height and challenge yourself further., Stand with your legs shoulder-width apart and hold 10-pound weights in each hand at your sides. Bend your knees and jump up in the air. At the same time, shrug your shoulders to help lift the weights. Land back down with both feet firmly balanced on the floor. Complete 3 sets of 25 repetitions every day.When this weight becomes easy, increase your weights in 5-poumd increments. Alternately, use a medicine ball instead of weights. Lift the ball above your head as you jump up. Bring the ball back to your chest when you land on the ground., In between other exercises, jump rope as quickly as possible for 30-second intervals. This will not only improve your ability to jump quickly and with height, but it will also improve your endurance and cardio performance.  Training your leg muscles will help you jump higher with more force. Do squats, deadlift weight training, and other strength training for your legs 2-3 times a week., After spending two weeks on these types of jump training exercises, re-measure your jump height to see how much you have improved. If you haven’t improved as much as you’d like, keep working at these drills.  

measure your current vertical jump height.  jump onto a box or bench.  do jump shrugging.  try jump roping.  strengthen your leg muscles.  re-measure your jump height after 2 weeks. 

 Use homemade bread, if possible, such as white bread, braided challah bread, or French bread. Slice the bread into six slices, about 1.5 in (3.8 cm) thick. Use a paring knife to cut a horizontal pocket into each slice of bread, taking care not to cut completely through the slice., Use homemade jam, if possible. Mix the jam and softened cream cheese together. Spoon the mixture into a piping bag or a sealable plastic bag.Use any jam or marmalade you like, such as blueberry, orange, or mixed berry.  Snip off a bottom corner of your sealable bag, if applicable. Squeeze the piping bag to fill the pocket of one slice of bread. Press down around the edges of the bread to secure the sandwich.Use about 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of filling for each sandwich. Repeat this process for each sandwich.  In a bowl, whisk together a batter of eggs, milk, cinnamon, and vanilla, if desired. Coat the bread on both sides., Place the butter in a large skillet or griddle over medium-low heat. Cook one side of the pocket until it is golden brown, then flip the bread with a spatula and cook the other side equally., You can top the pockets with sprinkled powder sugar, warmed-up jam, or syrup. Try adding a side, like breakfast meat or fresh fruit. 

select and slice bread.  combine the filling ingredients in a sealable bag or piping bag.  stuff the bread with filling.  dip the bread in the egg mixture.  cook each pocket for about four minutes on each side.  dress and serve the bread. 

 Asking her friends is she likes you is a less bold way of basically telling her that you're interested in her yourself. Still, if you're feeling shy but really want to know how she feels without asking her directly, then just ask her friends how she feels about you. They probably won't tell you how she feels, but they'll make it obvious that she likes you by acting excited and saying that you should talk to her. They'll also tell her that you like her right away, so be careful.   Her friends will, however, let you know if the girl doesn't like you and this will spare your feelings if she doesn't.  If you're feeling brave and really want to date this girl, then just find a time when you're alone together, like by your lockers after school, and ask her how she really feels about you. You can even admit that you like her first (if you do) and wait for her to respond. Don't put too much pressure on her -- just casually say that you've noticed that she might like you and that you want to know how she feels.   You can even complement her a bit to put her at ease.  If she admits that she likes you and you like her too, you don't have to jump up and down for joy or you'll look uncool. Instead, just show her that you're excited that you both like each other and ask her if she wants to hang out some time. If she doesn't like you, don't be a jerk about it. Just say, "Cool, it's no big deal," and act cool and calm as you say goodbye. This will show her that you're comfortable with yourself and who knows -- maybe she'll change her mind about you in the future.   Whatever happens, remember that you're in middle school. Relationships in middle school are fun, but they're usually short and shouldn't be taken too seriously. Just try to have fun and if it doesn't work out with this girl, someone else will definitely fall for you.  

ask her friends.  ask her yourself.  react appropriately. 

 When you're in high school, get involved in your school's drama department. Some theater departments allow students to direct plays. If you can't direct, get experience doing every other aspect of theater. This will help make you marketable in addition to helping you get into theater college programs.Look into youth theater in your area. A lot of community theaters let teenagers take part in their productions. Look for any opportunities to get experience. Act in productions and work as a stage manager. Run the lights and the props. Find out what you're best at, and what you love to do best. Ask your teacher for a realistic assessment of your talents.; , Theater is, of course, highly literary, and the main part of a director’s job is to interpret a written text.If you want to make it as a director, you need to feed your passion for drama by immersing yourself in it. Reading will help you to develop your ideas and approaches while giving you a deep well of knowledge to draw on. By reading about the context of your favorite plays, you will learn much more about them, which will feed into your ideas about how to direct plays.   Read plays, novels, screenplays, and adaptations, as well as literary criticism, history, and biography.Take one of your favorite plays and try to develop a deeper understanding by reading around it. For example, if you love Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot, read some of his other plays and novels to get a fuller understanding of him as a writer. You can also read some biographies and literary criticism, as well as social or cultural histories about the time and place in which he lived and wrote. Ask yourself how this extra knowledge can inform your interpretation of the play. Imagine you are trying to explain a character to an actor, and write down some thoughts on how you would do this for practice.  If you want to be a stage director, you should go to the theater as much as possible. See as wide an array of plays as you can to broaden your knowledge and give you an insight into staging and production. Go to every kind of theater you can, from the best theater in New York to a tiny community or school theater in a small town. The more plays you see, the more knowledge and understanding you will have.See a variety of plays. See classics, experimental, children's, and musicals. Even if the play is terrible, you will likely learn something. Go see different adaptations of the same play. Seeing the way different theaters perform the same play - or plays by the same playwright or from the same period - can teach you a lot about directing. See plays in other countries. Translate plays from other languages if you can. This can give you a unique perspective on the theater world and performances.Many theater productions have question and answer sessions after some performances. Attend these sessions and ask questions, or listen to the playwright, director, and actors discuss their process., Directing is very hands-on and practical, but a director will have a bachelor’s degree in theater production or some related media or arts field.Decide which schools will be the best for your career goals and your financial situation.   Find a city with notable theaters and theater programs. Charleston, Boston, San Francisco, New York, and Portland are all great cities of the arts with good training programs. Think carefully about what you want to study, and speak to people in the departments you are considering. Directors include graduates in drama, English literature, music, creative and performing arts, and foreign languages. Other humanities topics such as history, philosophy, and psychology can all be a good foundation., If you can't afford a prestigious university, go to a state college with a thriving drama department. Although there will be some prestige attached to famous institutions, a state college with a very active department could be a great place to get lots of hands on experience in a variety of settings.   While at the state college, make sure to build your resume by participating in theater productions, summer institutes, community theater, workshops, and anything else you can find.  Some performing arts schools have master’s programs in directing, which can be excellent way to learn the skills if you studied something unrelated.With a bachelor’s degree, you can start a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) course. These can be highly selective, and will include extensive study of theory and criticism as well as practical skills.If you have a relevant degree and a reasonable amount of experience, graduate courses are certainly not essential, and can be very expensive.This could be particularly appropriate if your first degree is in a topic quite far removed for theater and drama.  Keep looking out for and attending workshops, drama labs, and short courses even after you graduate. This will help you to constantly develop and will introduce you to new ideas and new people all the time. The theater is always changing so refreshing your education regularly is a good idea., Directors acquire a lot of skills through experience and practice. When you are studying, you can work with your friends and fellow students to produce and direct plays. It will be a great chance to experience what it’s like to produce a play with no budget, and you will learn a lot about collaborating and improvising.Becoming a member of the drama society will also help to get to know lots of people who have similar interests.  Look beyond your courses for opportunities to become involved in theater in your city. One way to get an insight into how a theater runs is to work as an usher part time while you’re at college. You’ll come to know audiences and staff and maybe meet some people who can give you good advice.   You can also get involved in local amateur drama groups as a volunteer. With smaller community groups, you may find that you will be given more responsibility and more opportunity to contribute to all aspects of productions.  Try to get involved with local programs during the summer break. Ask your professors to help you find them. It doesn't matter what you do there; just get in and do something - acting, stage managing, handling props, lighting, set building. Do whatever and as much as you can.   Make a great impression on the people who run the program because you will need their recommendations later on. Look for opportunities with summer stock theaters.  Keep an open mind and try to get involved in all aspects. You will learn valuable lessons that you can take with you. Learning how to change a set, run lighting and arrange costumes are all skills that will help a director.As a director, you will be better able to communicate with all the specialist staff if you have some experience with what their work entails. At all stages of the game, tell everyone you are "learning to be a director," not "I want to be a director." Ask everyone in charge of anything to "teach me how to do that." People love that, and it shows the right state of mind. Be humble, but not shy or retiring. Show your passion without your ego.  To be a good theater director, you must love and enjoy being around actors. Meeting actors and talking to actors helps you begin to understand what role they will play in the theater production. Start to learn about the relationship between a director and an actor. Take this time to understand the creative process of an actor so you know what they go through every night.Consider taking acting classes. This helps you go through the same processes that actors will go through, so you can put yourself in their shoes.  One the main things that directors have to do is deal with people. You have to inspire them, but more important, you have to make people do what you want them to do. Sometimes, that means making people play roles they may be unhappy playing. Learning how to relate, talk to, and inspire people will help you be successful., There are plenty of organizations and networks out there for young aspiring directors. Being a member of a network will help you stay in touch with your peers and will make it easier to stay in the know about news and job opportunities.It can also be nice just to talk to people who are experiencing the same thing as you. You can join a relevant union, such as the Actor's Equity Union, to keep updated on news in the industry.  Many directors get jobs through networking and contacts. After college, move to Los Angeles or New York or another town with an active theater community. Visit the little workshops and theaters until you are able to land a job doing something. During this time, keep meeting people and making contacts. Keep a list of these contacts, and keep in touch with these people. This will help you as you start directing.Try to move up the hierarchy, and if you have acting talent, try to get parts. If not, continue stage-managing and learn all you can. Acquiring a broad range of experience is very helpful for your directing skills and can help pay the bills as you develop your career. Always be on the look out for a place at the next-best theater and try to move up the ladder in size, prestige, and quality of production.  Working as an assistant is a great way to get your foot in the door and experience what life is like for a stage director. If you respect a local director and would love to work for that person, write him/her a letter with a CV and some information about yourself. Say what you can bring to the table, and why specifically you want to work with this director.It’s possible that people will offer you unpaid work assisting as an intern. This can be great experience, but isn’t sustainable in the long term. As an assistant, you should be dedicated and enthusiastic, but keep in mind that you don’t want to stay an assistant forever. Try to keep your career progressing outside of your assistant job. While you should be committed to your director, be sure you don’t end up mimicking the director in your own approach. Don’t lose sight of your own voice and style.  The early career of a stage director is almost always going to very difficult and frustrating. Keep an open mind about work and think about what kind of roles could help you develop your skills and experience.   Investigate running youth workshops, or working on community theater projects. Look for any avenue to get experience and contacts. Bear in mind that it will most likely take years to become a full-fledged director with a reliable income, and that many people never achieve it., Playwrights are the creative brain behind plays. Start meeting playwrights, getting to know them, and talking about their work. Talk with them about their process, and get them to help you understand the play better.   The more playwrights you befriend and meet, the more your name is put into the theater world. Think about this as networking. Interacting with playwrights can help them get to know you so they can ask you to direct their plays., While making ends meet, don’t lose sight of your goal. Get together with some of your like-minded friends and peers and form a company. Don’t worry about the size, and remember that throughout the history of theater small companies have been essential. It is part of the essence of theater.Forming your own company is great experience to help you learn how to direct and how to work with the other members of a theater production., The next step is to put on a show which you direct, somehow, somewhere. Perhaps the theater with which you're affiliated will let you direct a little show, or perhaps you and your friends can rent a theater and present your own. Sometimes, directing children's plays can be a good step.   A children's play can be a lot of fun, and you might find you really enjoy working with kids and would like to develop these skills.  This is a crucial skill to develop. You will have to spend time fundraising for the production.You will also have to market your play to attract an audience. These are duties that go beyond working with the actors.   Learning about how a theater's finances function and the costs of staging a play are crucial parts of your practical education.  You will learn so much from the experience of actually putting on a play independently of your school or college. Analyze what you do and make notes on how to improve. Think about your interactions with everyone involved, from actors to set designers. One of the most important things you will learn is how to work with a large group of people, many of whom will be working for little or no money.   Understanding everybody's motivations for working in the theater will help you work together. Evaluating the financial results will show you how much the play really cost, and highlight if you need to do more work on fundraising or on attracting larger audiences.  Becoming a theater director is a long, grueling process. It's about finding and making opportunities and hard work, but also entails ability and a little but of luck. Be prepared for setbacks and struggles along the road, but keep your enthusiasm for the theater.   One way to do this is to keep discovering new things in the performing arts and exposing yourself to them. This will help you stimulate ideas, which will all contribute to the development of your own unique directorial vision. Go to conferences, workshops, and other events to constantly learn and expand yourself. Read specialist publications on new theater and criticism to refresh your ideas.  

be part of your school's drama department.  read everything you can.  go to the theater.  get a bachelor's degree in a related field.  consider alternatives to universities.  consider graduate courses.  don’t stop learning.  get involved in the university drama society.  get experience outside of university.  fill your summers with theater.  get to know as many roles in the theater as possible.  learn about the actors.  learn to deal with people.  join a network for young directors.  meet people and network.  work as an assistant to a director.  take work when you can find it, and be prepared for a struggle.  meet playwrights.  form a company.  put on a play.  learn to manage a budget.  learn from your successes and your failures.  don't give up.

 You can use a letter of interest to set yourself apart as a potential buyer for a particular property. In essence, the letter gives you the chance to describe yourself, your family, your situation, and any other aspects you’d like to make a lasting impression on the home’s seller.   You can maximize the effectiveness of a letter of interest in particular situations. For example, in a “seller’s market” situation, you can face competition from a crowded market of buyers all seeking the same house. A letter of interest is a tool you can use to make you stick out from the crowd. Letters of interest are less common when both parties involved are using a realtor. If the seller uses a realtor, he or she may want to minimize any part in the selling process, and the seller’s realtor is more likely concerned with which potential buyer can close on the house quickly and for the largest percentage of the asking price.; , Learn what you can about the current owners of the house and highlight similarities with your own life in your letter. If both you and the seller work as teachers, you can write something like, "What would be better than to have a teacher taking care of your old house?"If you (or your partner, spouse, or children) attended the same school, work in the same sector, volunteer for the same charity, or share any other significant connections to the owners, be sure to make note of this in your letter.Don't sound too formal: I am a 30 year old alumnus of University Xyz with a degree in chemistry.Do sound approachable: The U Xyz banner at open house brought back memories — I didn't expect to meet another alumnus out here!    , Clearly express why you love this specific home and neighborhood. Write something along the lines of, "My family and I love the beautiful backyard and look forward to many afternoons relaxing beside the pool."Focus on specific features of the home and neighborhood that you love, such as the sunroom, yard, surrounding walking trails, etc.People are often still attached the houses they’re selling. Use this section to show the seller that you have the proper appreciation for the house. Show the seller that selling to you would leave the house in good hands.  An emotional connection between buyer and seller can be crucial to purchasing a home, so don't be afraid to use emotional language. However, honesty and authenticity always go a long way, so avoid coming across as saccharine or desperate. Don't mention sad stories: ...turned down from several houses . . . looking to escape an awful neighborhood...Do tug on heartstrings in an upbeat way: ...kids loved running down the beach . . . couldn't stop smiling when I looked at the view...    This also means you shouldn’t exaggerate what you love about the house. The current owner will know the house better than anyone, including the work it needs. Overselling how perfect the house is can easily home across as inauthentic. Don’t be afraid to mention that you’d repaint, finish the basement, etc. This also tells the seller that you’re willing to invest in the upkeep of the house.  Focus on your strengths, financial stability, and other positive characteristics that would make you the perfect homeowner. Highlight why you would make a great owner.  Don't brag: ...outstanding work ethic . . . pillar of the community...Do mention positive traits: I am community-minded and volunteer at my local school., Reiterate your excitement to purchase the house, as well as your most salient qualities. The closing paragraph of a letter of interest can be the most crucial, and thus it is important to close on a positive note.   A closing paragraph might also imagine the future you and your family will enjoy in the home. You might write, "I would be so excited to raise my family here, and would enjoy many years creating memories in this home." Express your sincere appreciation for the owner's time. Include a warm thank you at the end of the letter, such as, "Your consideration is greatly appreciated," or similar wording. , Outline a few important reasons why you would love to (and should) live in the house, but definitely keep it under a page.   Try to avoid including too much detail about your own life story, and avoid complaining about the difficulties you might be experiencing in finding a home. 

learn when a letter of interest can benefit you.  form a connection.  tell the buyer why you love the home.  write emotionally but authentically.  paint a positive picture of yourself.  save the best for last.  keep the letter short. 

 In the original 3 maps (Verruckt, Shi No Numa, and Der Riese) there are 4 machines spread out on any Nazi Zombie map and they each have their own specific power-up. Juggernog: This is probably the most important perk you can buy in the game. It is pricey (2500 points) but it is well worth your money if you want to survive in the game. The Juggernog makes your resistance to zombies better. What I mean by that is Zombies without the Juggernog can kill you in 2 hits. With the Juggernog, it will take 5-6 hits before you go down, making it an invaluable survival tool. Quick Revive: This is cheaper than the Juggernog (1500 Points)but it is still worth your money. The Quick Revive is just what it is, it allows you to revive your teammates quicker than usual. This is important in later rounds as zombies get quicker and harder to kill, so the less time you spend trying to help someone, the better. In Solo Play, you can revive yourself with a purchase of a quick revive. When you go down with the perk, you automatically get revived. While your down and getting revived, the game gives you the upgraded version of the starting pistols (Mustang and Sally), which are now grenade pistols. Speed Cola: This is a perk that allows you to reload your gun faster and to aim faster; it is basically a sleight of hand perk. This is the most expensive power-up (3000 Points) so save your money up to get it. This power-up comes in handy when you are cornered and need to reload fast. Definitely get this perk, especially if you have weapons that take a long time to reload (LMG's, Thunder Gun, etc.). Double Tap and Double Tap 2x: Double Tap (2000 points) is a perk that allows your weapons to fire at a faster rate than normal. The original Double Tap is available in the WaW and Black Ops zombie maps. However, the Double Tap 2x; which is available in Black Ops 2 zombie maps, is different from the original. This upgraded version of the Double Tap not only allows you to fire faster, but it also makes your bullets more powerful, which is very helpful to the player. Double Tap 2x is definitely worth getting in the newer BO2 maps, but I would personally stay away from it in the older maps unless that is the only other perk you can buy outside of the original 3 sodas.; , These perks are not contained within the first maps (with the exception of mule kick in Black Ops) and some perks are specific only to one map, so you have to play the different maps in order to access all of the new soda machines.   Dr.(PHD) Flopper (found in Ascension, Call of the Dead, Shangri-La, Moon, and Origins): Dr. Flopper (2000 points) is a perk that is found in the all of the Black Ops map packs; it is a perk that allows you to dive and create explosive damage. It is most effective when you dive into a group of zombies from heights (the lander platform area where you buy the Dr. Flopper in Ascension, for example). The zombies are destroyed instantly after you perform the jump. Also, another aid the perk provides is that you are immune to all recoil damage when shooting a ray gun at zombies in close range. Dead Shot Daiquiri (Call of the Dead, Shangri-La, Moon, Mob of the Dead, and Origins): Dead Shot Daiquiri (1500 points) is a new perk that assists the player with shooting. When you aim down sight with any weapon with this perk, your aim is automatically directed towards the head of any approaching zombie. It also reduces sway in Sniper Rifles. This perk is helpful if you have a hard time aiming your weapon and getting head shots; if your a more advanced player, however, it is not as useful. Mule Kick (available in every map on Black Ops including original WaW maps, Die Rise, Buried, and Origins): Mule Kick (3000 points) is a perk that simply allows you to have 1 extra weapon in your arsenal. This means that you have the ability to have 3 weapons as opposed to 2. You can treat this extra weapon just as you would your original 2, that includes upgrading it through the pack-a-punch. It is important to keep in mind, however, that if you go down, the third weapon you acquired goes away. Since the extra weapon is a result of the perk, when the perk goes away, so does this extra weapon. Very handy perk to have, especially in later rounds where ammo becomes a factor. Stamin Up (Ascension, Call of the Dead, Shangri-La, Moon, Tranzit, Buried, Origins): Stamin Up (2000 points) is a perk that allows you to run faster and for a longer duration. It is a perk that is certainly helpful when you need to move through tighter areas of the map and need to move fast. Tombstone (Tranzit): Tombstone (2000 points) is a new perk (found only in BO2) which allows you to come back to live without losing your perks and weapons. How it works is that when you go down, you are given an option to either hold down the action button and die right away (which says "don't feed the zombies") or you can wait for someone to revive you. Here is the catch; you can only regain all of your perks and weapons if you decide to hold down the action button and die immediately. If someone revives you before you complete this action, you do not get your perks back, only your weapons. If you die without using the tombstone perk, you would return to the next round in the game as if you never had the perk (with your starting pistol and nothing else). So if you want to utilize this perk, you need to hold down the action button immediately and die. When the next round begins, you need to find your tombstone (the icon that is left where you died the previous round). If you do not get to this icon within a certain amount of time, the icon goes away and you lose everything, so you need to make sure that you re-spawn close to it so you can get all of your weapons and perks back. It is a useful perk, however, risky for your team since now they have to fight the hordes of zombies without you. Who's Who (Die Rise): This new perk (2000 points) is similar to the last one as it allows you to regain all of your perks and weapons if you go down. There are some differences though, most notable is the fact you have to revive yourself. Once you go down, you are re-spawned in an area close to where you went down. You are now in a limbo mode where you have the chance to revive yourself. The zombies still recognize you are alive and will still try to attack you while you are in this limbo state. In this mode you are armed only with a pistol to defend yourself (no perks). In order to revive yourself with all of your weapons and perks, you need to be able to elude the zombies and revive yourself without going down in this limbo state. You need to do this quickly, as there is a limited time given to revive the player with your limbo character. If you do go down in this limbo state, then you are down for good and need to be revived by another player. If you go don't go down but don't revive your character in time, then that "limbo" character becomes your playable character and you carry on through the game as normal. If you are now playing with your limbo character, you lose all of your perks and weapons and only armed with the pistol they give you. Not personally one of my favorite perks as it is complicated to use, especially during the later rounds where knifing and pistols do not kill the zombies. Vulture Aid (Buried): This perk (3000 points) allows you to pick up more points for killing zombies and allows you to see all the items you can buy in the map. When you kill a zombie with this perk, the zombie either drops ammo or money. You have to run to where you killed that zombie to get the extras; an extremely helpful tool when ammo and/or money is tight. Also, the perk allows you to see anything on the map you can buy much more easily as it shows you larger and brighter icons that you can see from anywhere. These icons include the mystery box, other soda machines, and the wall weapons. Especially when you need something on the run, having this perk as a helpful reminder is very helpful. Electric Cherry (Mob of the Dead and Origins): This new (2000 points) perk activates when players reload their weapons. When a player reloads, a shock is given out and electrocutes the zombies. The power of the shock depends on how much ammo you have left; if you have a lot of ammo, then the shock is small. If you have low ammo and reload, then the shock will be larger. Der Wunderfizz-This perk (1500 points) provides a random perk to you with purchase, very similar to the mystery box concept. Need to be careful with this perk, as you can only get four perks and you might not get the perks you want through this machine.  

in order to do well in nazi zombies, there are a few things that every player must do to make it to the higher levels:  soda machines: soda machines are powerups (perks) that give you a special ability for a certain amount of time.  new perks: as new zombie map packs have been released, there have been new perks that have been added to the game.

Once it's all done. , Using programs such as Windows Defender may help quite a bit to clean/clear up unwanted programs and get your around the unwanted programs entirely., Only accept program or program modifications seem to be credible or able to backtrack to be known to the piece of software you are trying to obtain.  Gather a list of programs on a weekly basis of programs that might ask you to update the program or will end up doing an auto-search for updates in the background, to know if you can or will encounter boxes from programs that you might not remember later on down the line.  

if you are running windows, here's what you need to do, first of all, click on the "start" button and go to "control panel".  click on "add or remove programs" to open the up the properties of the software and programs that you have.  ,  click on the software or program that you want to change or remove from.  now have fun with a computer and the uninstall is complete!  ,  perform a full-scan of your computer with an anti-virus and anti-spyware/anti-malware program.  be careful of which user account control boxes you click to accept, if you are have administrative rights on the computer. 

 This avoids confusion and unnecessary conflict and doubt when trying to resolve any issues. This is an essential factor to influence decisions in your favor.; , Do not lose your temper when discussions become controversial. Try not succumbing to the pressures, bluffs and subtle threats of the other party.  These include body language, signals between members and the atmosphere in the room when certain matters are discussed.  This includes the needs or demands of the other party as well.  Use tact when dealing with sensitive issues and by granting concessions neither too soon or too late. Determine when flexibility is desired and when it is not. Keep in mind ultimate goals yet seeking mutually beneficial agreements.  By raising tensions further, you could create a spiral which in turn could result in negative consequences for both parties.  In turn, try using this power constructively. This simply means to work, bearing the needs of both parties in mind, by trying to achieve a win-win situation.  These lead to tensions later on in the negotiation process. Bitterness and a fighting battle results, which may in turn, once again spiral out of control.  Be sensitive to the opposing party. Do not belittle them or make them feel worthless.  This includes being able to emphasize with the other team when necessary and trusting one's own judgement as well as gut instincts.  These include investigating problems efficiently, being able to clarify goals and identify barriers to achieving these goals.Being able to identify criteria for reaching viable solutions.  

present arguments clearly, concisely and with confidence.  remain calm.  stay alert and watch for verbal and non verbal communication shown by members of the other party.  remain sensitive to needs and concerns.  conduct negotiations in a diplomatic spirit.  look for ways to smooth tensions, rather than aggravating them.  acknowledge what power is available and attainable.  avoid win-lose scenarios.  use bluffs, subtle threats, aggression and antagonistic tactics very carefully.  adopt a sense of humor.  improve your problem solving techniques. 

 Is somebody in your family allergic? Do you live in a tiny apartment unsuitable for a canine to live in? Is Rover too much money? There are many problems that may arise, but that's okay, because they're fixable.; , There are many hypo-allergenic dogs out there that you can get. Research where you can find hypo-allergic dogs in your area and go visit them. Bring along the person in your family that is allergic to them, so that you can see if they have an allergic reaction or not. If they don't, great! If they do, keep looking for other kinds of hypo-allergenic dogs.  If you live in an apartment, you can't get a huge German Shepherd. You'll have to settle for a small dog such as a Yorkie. Since your home doesn't have a lot of space, you'll need to make sure that you take the dog out for at least two walks a day, so that it can get its energy out. If you can't commit to going out with your dog that much, you may need to settle for another pet, such as a kitten.  If this is the case, sadly, you're pretty much stuck. However, you can still get the dog owner experience...with someone else's dog. If you know an elderly person with a dog or someone without the time or energy to play with their dog or take their dog for a walk, ask them if you can come over a few times a week and play with their dog. The dog owner will most likely say yes, because they'll love the fact that their dog can get exercise without them lifting a finger.  You've seen those pet store prices, and they're high. However, you can save a little money on the initial purchase of the dog by going to your local animal shelter/rescue group. There are many great dogs there that need a great home like yours. There are even some pure-breeds there! Because these animals need to be adopted, the prices for them are several hundred dollars lower than those pricy pet stores. However, be warned that you'll need to pay for more than just the dog. You'll also need to buy its food, toys, leash, vet bills, etc., which can rack up to a large sum of money. If you and your guardian decide that your financial situation isn't suitable for a dog at the moment, you might just have to wait a few years until you can afford a dog. Sometimes patience is rewarded! If your guardian decides that getting a shelter dog would be a good choice for your family, congratulations! You'll get that pooch of your dreams while being a dog-saver!  , Do extra chores around the house. Look after your neighbor's pets while they're away on vacation. This will teach you a lot about animal care. Look after your younger siblings/family members to show your guardian that you're responsible enough for a dog. Don't whine, cry, beg, blackmail, or bribe them to get you a dog. This shows a huge lack of maturity, and will actually decrease your chances of getting a dog. Write your parents a letter or make up a contract saying that you'll be fully responsible for the dog and that you'll take care of it. This shows that you're serious about getting a dog.  Do you want a Saint Bernard, but your guardian wants a Chihuahua? Or vice versa? Make a compromise and decide on a medium-sized dog, such as a Beagle. Do you want an energetic dog that wants to play all day, but your guardian wants a lazy lap dog? Decide on a dog that's ready to play when you are, but can also be able to calm down and sit on your lap.  

find out why your guardian doesn't want you to get a dog.  is somebody in your family allergic to dogs?,  do you live in a small apartment or small home?,  does your landlord not allow pets?,  is a dog too much money?,  if your guardian doesn't think you're responsible or mature enough for a dog, prove them wrong!,  if you and your guardian can't agree on a dog, make a compromise. 

 Shoe store salespeople will talk to you about ankle pronation, impact pattern, and plantar shape — i.e. the imprint of the bottom of your foot — but recent studies indicate that to prevent injury, you are best off simply picking a shoe that you find comfortable. It turns out that people are very good at intuitively picking shoes that will work best for their style of movement.One exception to the “pick shoes by comfort" rule is if you have flat feet. In this case, you will probably need special shoe inserts and arch supports.Save high heels for special occasions. Wearing them too frequently can lead to chronic knee pain., Particularly if you run or walk a lot, it is important to replace your shoes before the soles get too compressed. If you begin to experience sore arches, shin pain, or achy knees, then it’s time to replace your shoes. It’s better, however, to replace them before pain appears.Keep a log of how far you walk or run each day. Replace your shoes when you have covered between 400 and 600 miles. The specific distance will depend on your weight and running style. Heavier runners and runners with longer strides will need to replace their shoes sooner.If the bottom of your shoes becomes worn down and smooth, replace them.  Braces provide added support to the knee ligaments. Particularly if you are playing a collision sport (football, lacrosse, hockey, rugby), knee braces have been shown to reduce the risk of knee injury.Players of contact sports (basketball, soccer) and sports that requires rapid changes of direction (tennis) may also benefit, as many people engaged in activities that pose a significant risk of knee injury, such as skiing. Talk to your regular doctor, a sports medicine doctor, or an orthopedist about the right brace for you.    Prophylactic — For athletes in contact sports. These braces, designed to protect ligaments, attach above and below the knee, with one or two hinged metal bars connecting the sides of the brace.Functional — For athletes in contact sports. These braces protect knee ligaments in a fashion similar to prophylactic braces, with a metal “shell” that is hinged on both sides of the knee.Patellofemoral (sleeve) — For people suffering from knee pain or athletes looking for some knee stabilization. A brace made of elastic material – usually neoprene – that is designed to hold the patella in the proper position and thus reduce chronic knee pain. These braces offer some knee stabilization, but will do little to prevent ligament damage. 

get shoes that are comfortable and have plenty of cushioning.  replace your shoes regularly.  wear knee braces to reduce the risk of injury during sports or while performing dangerous activities. 

 A heat gun or hair dryer will usually work, but you may have to run an extension cord out to your vehicle. Another option is to use hot water, but be conscious of the current temperature. If it is still below freezing, you should not use water as it may refreeze., Look at your service manual to see which wheels the parking brake holds. Then use your heat source to apply heat to the brake cable and the calipers/drums at that wheel. You should apply the heat long enough for the brake components to be warm to the touch. The amount of time this takes will vary based on how cold it is outside.  This will have to be done from underneath the vehicle so you may need to lift your car. For safety reasons, you should turn off your engine and chock your wheels before getting under the car.  After applying heat to the brake system, immediately try to release the brake. Do not give the braking components time to refreeze. 

locate an appropriate heat source.  apply heat to the brake components.  try to release your brake. 

 With any kind of forearm tendinitis, it is more common for your dominant hand to be affected, but both arms may be affected. Tendinitis will occur in the tendons against which you consistently exert the most force.Tendinitis may also occur in the tendons that control either extension or flexion (straightening or bending), but it rarely occurs in both at the same time. The repetitive motion that exerts the most stress — either force against flexion or against extension — will cause tendinitis.  Tennis elbow may develop if you exert force against an object with your elbow extended.Although tennis elbow is often caused by playing tennis, using a lighter racquet and a two-handed backhand swing may reduce your chances of developing this condition. Some other types of movement that may also cause tennis elbow include:   Repetitive heavy lifting or using heavy tools Jobs that involve the use of squeezing and twisting movements or precision motions New or uncommon movements, such as gardening for the first time in the spring, lifting a new baby, or packing and moving your home  , Although named after the sport of golf, golfer’s elbow can also be caused by other sports that involve gripping and/or throwing motions, such as baseball, football, archery, or javelin throwing.Some other types of movement that may cause golfer’s elbow include:   Doing jobs that involve repetitive motion of the elbow, including computer use, gardening, chopping or painting Using vibrating tools Using a racquet that is too small or heavy for your ability or putting excessive topspin on the ballParticipating in other repetitive activities for an hour or more on consecutive days, such as weight lifting, cooking, hammering, raking, or chopping wood 

think about whether you are having symptoms in one or both arms.  identify repetitive movements that may have contributed to your tennis elbow.  consider activities that may have contributed to your golfer’s elbow. 

 The age of consent varies from state to state, so know what the legal age is where you live. If you are under the age of consent, do not try to date someone who is over the age, as that can create difficulties in setting boundaries and could potentially have criminal implications.; , Older guys will have more experiences and freedoms than younger girls. They might drive a car, have less parental supervision, or have already had sexual relationships. Know ahead of time what you’re comfortable with and stay true to that instead of worrying about what he wants.   Be confident about telling him what you are and aren’t okay with. It’s better to know that your expectations are different are early on rather than staying quiet and finding yourself in a compromising situation. Speaking your mind and establishing boundaries are signs of maturity that will make him respect you more. You don’t have to wear skimpy clothing to get his attention. If you’re comfortable, wear clothes that flatter your figure and make you feel confident, but aren’t overly sexy or revealing. You want the guy to be interested in who you are, not just your body. Leave room for mystery., While some guys may like girls who seem younger, others prefer girls who act more mature for their age. Being mature doesn’t mean being dry, serious, or boring— you don’t have to pretend to be someone you’re not. Typically, behaving maturely means being confident, comfortable, and cool. Girls mature faster than boys, so you may already be on the same maturity level as the guy you have your eye on.   Avoid being clingy and following him around everywhere. Doing this might make you seem like more of a little sister than a romantic interest. Do not act needy, as this is a sign of low self-esteem. Neediness is unattractive because it demands constant attention, reassurance, and affirmation from another person which can be annoying. Wanting to be with somebody is very different from needing to be with somebody.Don’t brag about how “experienced” you are. Trying to seem mature in this way actually has the opposite effect. Being confident in who you are is mature and extremely attractive.  Go right up to him and introduce yourself if he doesn’t know who you are yet. Say: “Hi, I’m (your name),” then “And you are?” or “Who are you?” if you want to be a bit more playful and brazen. Repeat his name to help you remember it and let him know you are attentive: “Hey, Ryan, it’s really nice to meet you,” or “Oh, Sergio, I love that name!” You go to the same school so you have plenty in common to keep it from being awkward. You can break the ice by referencing how you’ve noticed him: “I see you walk past my gym class every day and I wanted to put a name to the face!” Start talking to him on Facebook or other social media., If you have the same lunch period, talk to him in line or, if you already know each other, sit at his table. If you have a class together, sit near him so you can talk easily or ask him a question about the subject. Get to know his friends so there might be an opportunity to hang out outside of school.  Ask him questions and listen. If you don’t know each other very well yet, keep it simple with questions like “How was your day?” or “What do you like to do on the weekends?” Find out if he plays a sport, what kind of music he likes, what he likes to do in his free time. You don’t have to interview him or blast him with questions, but make sure you’re not just talking about yourself, which is easy to do. Find ways to show him that you remember what he’s told you. Wish him luck on his game or ask him if he’s listened to his favorite band’s new album. Don’t pry into personal details like his religion or family dynamic too soon, keep it light and playful. Find out what you have in common and let the conversation develop naturally.   If you’re struggling to start a conversation, try making a comment that ends in a question. “I saw the basketball team got new uniforms, do you like them?” or “It looks like it’s gonna rain, doesn’t it?”  , Keep your flirting playful and fun, not forceful and you’ll make him feel comfortable and want to be around you.  If he’s across the room, make eye contact with him. Don’t stare, but glance up occasionally and catch his eye. For an extra sexy gaze, look up, down, then up again through your lashes. Make eye contact when you’re talking to him, but not so much that it feels like you’re staring him down.  You don’t need to grin ear-to-ear; giving a warm, genuine smile will make you seem approachable and friendly. Smile with your eyes so that your whole face lights up.  We all love a bit of flattery, but make sure that it’s objective so that you don’t seem too eager or obsessive. An objective compliment is one that states the facts rather than your opinion, which is subjective.   Subjective: “I really love your dimples.” “I think you have the most beautiful eyes I’ve ever seen.” Complimenting in this fashion gives away the fact that he’s already won you over and doesn’t have to work for your attention. Objective: “You played great in the game last night” (if he actually did play well). “ You have great eyes.” This type of compliment is based on observation and lets your crush know that you notice them, but will make him wonder how interested you are. Not coming on too strong will keep him wanting more.  If you already know each other call him by a name that’s cute yet masculine and will be personal between the two of you., You want to boost his confidence, but not come off as fake by laughing at a joke that’s obviously lame., Touching a person is a way to indicate that you’re comfortable with him. If you’re laughing at one of his jokes, briefly put your hand on his arm. Make your contact casual and seem almost accidental. Walk next to him a little too closely. Give him a gentle, playful nudge when you pass him in the hall. A light smack on the arm can be silly and fun, but don’t push or punch him, even if you’re just joking around. Hurting him is not flirtatious. The point is to be attentive, not aggressive.  It’s said that the sweetest sound is the sound of one’s own name. Using his name when you talk to him creates intimacy. “I like your new shoes, Adam.”  

make sure it is safe and legal.  put your comfort level first, not his.  be yourself and be mature.  talk to him.  find casual ways to be around him.  get to know him.  flirt smart, not hard.  flirt with your eyes.  smile.  compliment him.  give him a nickname.  laugh at his jokes, but only if they’re good.  make physical contact.  call him by his name. 

 Making a faux fur blanket is a simple process, but it does require some special tools and materials. To make a faux fur blanket, you will need:2 to 3 yards of faux fur 2 to 3 yards of fleece Lots of pins Scissors Exacto knife for cutting faux fur fabric (optional) A sewing machine; , Lay the faux fur down on a clean, dry surface with the fur facing up. Then, lay the fleece directly over the faux fur. Make sure that the edges of both fabrics are lined up. If the fabric pieces are not the same size, then just line up as many edges as you can.Keep in mind that if you want to use faux fur for both sides of the blanket, then you can. However, it will cost more for the extra faux fur fabric.If using faux fur for both sides, then lay the two faux fur pieces so that the fur sides are facing each other. Other backing fabric options you might use in place of fleece include flannel, satin, cotton, microfiber, and jersey. Just make sure to place the right side (print or texture side) so that it is facing towards the faux fur fabric.  Use your scissors to trim either the fleece or faux fur if necessary. It is important for the two pieces to be roughly the same size.Don’t worry too much about a slight difference in the size of the two fabrics or jagged edges. These will be hidden on the inside of the blanket when you sew it. If you need to cut the faux fur fabric, then it is best to do so on the back side (non-furry side) of the fabric and use an exacto knife. This will make it easier to avoid cutting through the fur and ending up with stray hairs everywhere., To ensure that the edges stay lined up, you will need to use pins.Pin all the way around the edges of the blanket except for a roughly 16” section extending from one of the corners.Be sure to use lots of pins to hold the two pieces of fabric together! Place a pin at least every 8 inches along the edges.  Sew a straight stitch about ½ inch away from the edge of the blanket. Remove the pins as you go and return them to a pin cushion or magnetic pin holder.Hold the fabric firmly, but do not stretch it out as you sew. Just try to keep it flat and even. Sew at a slow, steady pace. Try to avoid getting any fur in the seam. Brush it away from the edges with your fingers if necessary., You should have left a 16” area of the fabric unpinned. This area will serve as the gap through which you can pull the blanket through and invert it. Stop sewing when you reach this area.Lift the needle and presser foot so that you can pull the fabric away from the sewing machine. Then, begin inverting the blanket so that the faux fur is on the outside. Keep pulling the fabric through the gap until it is totally inverted. You may need to push out the fabric at the corners a bit to ensure that they don’t look lumpy. Use your fingers or a small object to gently push the fabric out at the corners of the blanket., To complete the blanket, you will just need to sew up the gap. Fold the edges under so that the raw edges will be hidden, and then begin to pin them to hold them in place. Then, sew over the area about ½” from the edge.Remove the pins as you go. Be sure to place the pins in a pin cushion or magnetic pin holder as you remove them.  There may be a few hanging threads left over when you finish working on your blanket, so be sure to trim these away. Snip any loose threads as close to the edge of the blanket as you can get without cutting the fabric.   After you trim away the loose ends, your blanket is ready to use!  

gather your materials and tools.  lay the faux fur and fleece out.  trim the edges to make the pieces even.  pin the edges together.  sew along the edges.  stop sewing and invert the blanket.  pin and sew the final edge.  trim any loose strings. 

; , Cover the surface with something like a piece of printer of printer paper to avoid getting nail polish on the surface itself. Avoid using newspaper as the print can easily rub off onto the ribbon and spoil it. , A simple narrow strip across the ends will suffice.   Don't paint too much or you'll get stiff ends.  Once it's dry, the ribbons are ready to use again and they won't fray anymore.  

purchase some clear nail polish.  place the fraying ribbon on a flat surface.  use a pair of sharp scissors and carefully cut a diagonal line each end to remove the frayed ends.  ,  carefully paint the ends of the ribbon with the clear nail polish.  leave to dry. 

 This quick method will allow you to simply and easily convert between metric units without having to perform any multiplication or division. To begin, all you need to know is whether you're converting from a small unit to a larger unit or vice versa, as well as the size of the conversion you're making - in other words, whether your desired units differ from your initial units by 101, 102, etc.   Both of these can be determined by counting spaces and/or drawing an arrow on a line of the metric prefixes. For example, if we want to convert from kilometers to decameters, we know that we're converting from a large unit to a small unit because we have to travel to the right along the line to get from "kilo" to "deca," and we know that decameters are 102 times smaller than kilometers because "kilo" and "deca" are separated by two spaces.  Since two metric units always differ from each other by some multiple of ten, it's possible to make metric conversions simply by shifting your initial number's decimal point. When converting from a large unit to a smaller unit, shift the decimal point one digit to the right for each power of ten that your desired units differ from your initial units. When converting from a small unit to a larger unit, move the decimal place to the left. Remember that the power of ten by which your desired units differ from your initial units is given by the number of spaces apart the two units are on the line of prefixes.   For example, let's say that we want to convert 1 kilometer into centimeters. Since we can tell from the line of prefixes that centimeters are 105 times smaller than kilometers, we move the decimal point in "1" five spaces to the right. See below:  1.0 10.0 100.0 1,000.0 10,000.0 100,000.0. There are 100,000.0. centimeters in 1 kilometer.   You may also do the reverse - move a number's decimal to the left to convert to a larger unit.  When you move a number's decimal point, be sure to add zeroes for each space that you move the decimal point beyond the available digits. For instance, when converting 1 kilometer to centimeters, the decimal point is initially to the right of the number 1, as so: 1. Moving the decimal place to the right means you must insert a zero so that the number becomes 10.   The same principal applies when moving a decimal point to the left - begin inserting zeroes when you move the decimal beyond the number's available digits. For instance, let's say we want to convert 1 millimeter into meters. Since meters are 103 times larger than millimeters, we would simply move the decimal three spaces to the left as below:  1.0 0.10 0.010. Notice that we add a zero to the left of the 1. 0.0010. We add another zero to get our final answer. There are 0.001 meters in 1 millimeter.   Only add zeroes if you run out of digits when moving the decimal point. Inserting superfluous zeroes into the middle of a number can make your answer incorrect.  

determine the direction and size of the conversion.  move the decimal point in your measurement.  add zeroes as necessary. 

 Grade ranges vary among professors and teachers. If your professor or teacher provided a syllabus at the beginning of the year, it may list the grade range. Your school handbook may have this information as well. If you cannot find a range on any of your materials, ask your professor or teacher.  Although there are variations, this is the most common grading range for schools and universities in the USA. A "B" or higher is typically considered a "good" grade. A D is the lowest passing grade, but it may not fulfill requirements for further courses or college applications.An "A" is 90% to 100%. A grade of 94% or higher would be considered an “A.” A grade of 90%-93% would be considered an “A-.”  A "B" is 80% to 89%. A grade of 87% or higher would be considered a “B+.” A grade of 83%-86% would be considered a “B.” A grade of 80%-82% would be considered a “B-.”  A "C" is 70% to 79%. A grade of 77% or higher would be considered a “C+.” A grade of 73%-76% would be considered a “C.” A grade of 70%-72% would be considered a “C-.”  A "D" is 60% to 69%. A grade of 67% or higher would be considered a “D+.” A grade of 63%-66% would be considered a “D.” A grade of 60%-62% would be considered a “D-.”  An "F" is 59% and below. An “F” is a failing grade, so professors and teachers do not usually assign + or – values to “F” grades., The United Kingdom uses several grading scales in primary and secondary school, for tests such as the GCSE and A-levels. These have their own classification terms, but the percentages roughly correspond to the following. This system is also used for undergraduate work in the UK and in India.   70% to 100% is the highest grade, a mark of Distinction. 60% to 69% earns a Merit. 50% to 59% is Pass. Some schools Fail at 49% or below, while others fail at 39% or below.  

check your course materials for a grade range.  know the typical grading range in the united states.  learn the british marking system. 

 The takeoff ramp needs to be curved up to a steep lip about 45-75 degrees at the top, or else you overshoot and crash.  Remember that when you compact the dirt mounds, they get smaller. One good way not to push the wheelbarrow all the time is to put one and half times what you desire to have as the height of the jump (for example, a beginner that wants a jump 3 feet high actually needs 4.5 feet of dirt because of the loss from compaction) so you won't waste time shoveling again and pushing that wheelbarrow every time you need a little dirt. Make the lip of the jump flat so you can get as much air as possible.       ; , Another good idea is to use a roller this will help compact your jump and make them smoother and better. If the spaded shovel doesn't help just get a compacter and pack it down.  In addition, it makes the dirt more malleable.  Make them progressively bigger. Add berms and rollers to maintain and gather speed.  If in a tight area, just land & slow down, turn around, and do it again.  

mound rocks and logs in two piles and add dirt on top of it about as high as your skill level (2-3 feet for beginners and 5-9 feet for experts, the gap (if you feel like you are certain to crash, do a jump instead) needs to be 2–5 feet (0.6–1.5 m) for beginners and 8–15 feet (2.4–4.6 m) for experts).  compact the ramps down by hitting them with a flat spade or stamping on them.  add water to the dirt jump so it doesn't become dusty and break apart in clumps, and so it's easier to pack down.  make multiple jumps in a row, also known as a rhythm section.  focus on a set up that flows. 

 Many animals don't like the taste of hot pepper or how it burns their noses. Any commercial brand of hot sauce dissolved in water will do or you can create your own version taking any hot peppers and water using any recipe and putting this in a spray bottle. You have to repeat this every week or after it rains for it to work effectively.  Wear gloves and don't get hot peppers in your eyes or in an open wound. Capsaicin oil that is produced in such plants also burns the skin, nose and eyes. This will not work with birds. Birds are not affected by hot pepper and will still eat plants treated with it.; , Simply dropping peppermint oil throughout the landscape grounds will keep rodents away for a very long time. Peppermint oil makes rodents hair fall out! Also peppermint is non-toxic and smell good too., There lots of to choose from in the local home-improvement and hardware stores as well as on the web. Some of them are sprayed on from a spray bottle onto the plant and others are granules you sprinkle around in the soil. However many of these are for small scale repelling for like a small tomato row and not a huge tomato field.  Read the ingredients and do a little research to be certain that there aren't any hidden dangers or surprises within the repellents before it is purchased. Some repellents are only made for non-edible plants that are grown for beauty and not for plants grown for eating. Some repellents may be safe to eat but affect the taste of the food. The directions and descriptions will also indicate rather or not the repellent is rainproof and how often it needs to be applied all over again.  

use hot pepper spray.  consider using peppermint oil to deter rodents.  use ready made repellents according to directions. 

 Remove the shiny, polished panel on the top of your PlayStation 4 console. Apply gentle downward pressure to this panel with both hands and slide it away from the center line of the console, until it clicks out of place.; , This is a round, Phillips head screw with the shapes of the PlayStation logo engraved on it.  Remove this screw and set it aside.   Notice the other Torx screws sprinkled around the hard drive bay, but do not mess with them  , Pull the existing drive out of the bay. Remove any Phillips head screws attaching the old drive to the enclosure before setting it aside.  There will be more screws keep the hard drive in the enclosure. Remove them to replace the hard drive.  Attach your new drive to the enclosure with the same screws you just removed.   The PS4 will support any SATAII drive of no greater thickness than 9.5mm with at least a 160GB capacity. However, it makes the most sense to replace the drive with one that is larger and/or faster than the factory drive.  Slide the enclosed drive into the bay on the side of your console. Ensure that the screw holes on the enclosure and the hard drive bay are aligned  , Insert the large, rounded Phillips head screw from step 2 into the aligned holes and screw it in tightly.  Replace the shiny black panel to the top of the console. Lay the panel over the exposed hardware so that it is just a couple of inches from the seam, and slide it towards the seam until it clicks back into place.

 You should be able to stand upright while you hoe weeds. Make sure the handle of your hoe is long enough to allow you to stand while using it. If the hoe forces you to hunch over while hoeing, try to find a hoe with a longer handle.  If you want to control young weeds that are popping up in a large area or amongst your rows of plants, try a lightweight scuffle hoe. A diamond, triangle, or stirrup hoe will work best on young weeds., If you are dealing with large weeds, you can use a variety of hoes to get the job done. Try a field or grub hoe. You can also use a Warren hoe or a standard American garden hoe. These hoes can also be used to make furrows and chop compost., If you need to perform spot weeding, or if you need to remove weeds from a tight space, a hoe with a short handle will work well.

 Be aware of what your target market wants and what they are most interested in. Aim to evoke positive emotions from your advertising messages, to help them remember your brand.; ,, Design it carefully to ensure that you present the company's purpose to the right target market through the right marketing material. Custom floor mats are promotional items that can play a role in encouraging buying behavior of your customers.  Will you be using advertising mats as entrance mats, interior mats or giveaway mats?  , Custom floor mats are an enhancement to your visual merchandising strategy. For example, if you owned a clothing line dominated by red and black colors, you would choose a floor mat containing the same colors. Or, choose safe colors like black or brown, to create a sense of formality or professionalism.  Since the purpose is to let your brand get noticed, choose an oversized doormat so that people will notice it.   If you will use the floor mat in front of display, you can print on it "50% discount", "discounted products" or "limited stocks only". Get those bargains walking out the door! If you intend to use the mat as a promotional giveaway, choose a size that is just enough for a standard sized door entry. People will want it to be useful, not in their way. Add some contact details, such as the company's website or phone number.  Ensure that the logo is consistent with your other advertising strategies. Keep it simple and easy to recall.  Usually you can see rectangular shaped floor mats. But if your target market is kids, then, you can use irregularly shaped ones for the fun factor. For example, mats with curvy edges, animal shapes or favorite item shapes, such as a crayon or car.  Custom floor mats tend to be placed in high traffic areas. People will step on it hundreds of times. Therefore, use high quality prints to prevent early fading.   Choose high quality materials. Custom floor mats can be made of rubber, nylon, or Palmyra.

understand your target market.  figure out your unique selling point to represent the image of your brand.  ,  use custom floor mats as a new way to increase your brand's impact.  consider the purpose of the floor mat.  choose a color to match your store's appearance.  choose an oversized floor mat.  use an appealing logo or brand name on the floor mat.  choose an irregularly shaped floor mat.  use high quality prints. 

 The method above is the easiest to understand, but requires extra math to find the number of singles. Here's a way to skip that step and find the total bases using Hits instead: Total Bases = Hits + Doubles + (2 x Triples) + (3 x Home Runs).   This works because one base per Hit takes care of all the singles. Since this also awards one base for each double, you only need to add 1 more base per double to find the total. Similarly, add two extra bases for triples, and three extra for home runs.  Just as before, the slugging percentage is equal to the total bases divided by at bats.  

find the total bases with a faster method.  divide by at bats.

 Often times over the years clothes can become piled up without you even realizing it. The first step to sort this all out is to get all of your clothes out from your dresser, closet, attic, and below your bed. Lay everything out, either across your floor, or on top of your bed. Begin to pair things together, based on color, size, and fabric.Once you have started to make categories, place each of your articles in select piles. Begin to match box and suitcase sizes. If you have a relatively small pile of specific articles, you can pair that pile with a smaller box. Some of the larger piles might have to be matched with a suitcase or larger box.; , This is the perfect time to try on some of the old in your closet that you haven't worn in ten years. Check the clothes for mildew, moth balls, flees, bedbugs, etc. Smell them to see if they have a musty scent. Determine whether or not they are outdated. After you search through your closet/cupboard, you should have a pile of outdated, outgrown, and worn out clothes to throw away.Run your fingernail overtop of the fabric. This will help loosen any bugs, or bedbug fecal matter (dried blood) which is present on your clothes. It is best to dispose of these clothes, especially if they are old and haven't been worn in a while. Donate clothing that is still in good shape and does not fit you or is not appropriate for the climate in your new home. Many people like to take clothes to Goodwill or homeless shelters. Throw out clothing that is torn, stained or too worn to wear in public. This is especially true when it comes to any old underwear and socks which have been crammed in your dresser drawer for many years.  You will probably not finish all of your unpacking on the first day of your move, so keep a small bag with a few changes of clothes that you can use when you first arrive at your new home. Remember to leave out an outfit for moving day as well, and include undergarments and socks.Pack the items you need upon arrival to your new home in a separate container. This could include not just clothes, but also toothbrushes, deodorant, hairspray, etc.  When you move, chances are you will have to move glassware, dishes, etc. Wrap these items in some of those clothes you were going to throw away. Find specific items which fit the shape and size of what you want to wrap. If there are elongated items you can place them in pants legs. If it is a wide plate you wish to wrap, place it in the body of a shirt.Carefully stack these items on top of one another, or side-to-side. Do not throw the items down and break them. You can also add extra layers of old clothes in between the items when you start packing them up. Add a shirt, or an extra pair of pants, in between the items. Pack your glasses or stemware in knee high socks.  If you are taking your dresser with you when you move, you can leave some of the items in the drawers. You should leave lightweight items like underwear, socks, t-shirts, etc., while taking out sweatpants, jeans, coats, etc. You then have the choice of taking your dresser as a whole or breaking it down into its component parts. Get people who are big, or who have upper body strength to move the dresser.If your drawers are generally loose, with no locking mechanism, it it best to remove the drawers. You will want to wrap each of the drawers separately, with a large container of plastic wrap. Go around the drawer in both directions, multiple times. Do this until the drawer has been completely wrapped, and all of the contents are secure. If you decide to take the dresser as a whole, you will want to secure the drawers. Take a bungee cord and wrap it all the way around the dresser, overtop of one of the drawers. Hook the two ends of the bungee cord. Then take more bungee cords and wrap it around the other drawers, all the way around the dresser. Safely secure the dresser in the moving van. You can either use bungee cords or lifting straps. Tightly wrap them around your dresser and secure them to the base/side of your truck (on the inside).  You will want to make sure your folds are neat and tight so that you can fit as many clothes into each of your boxes. The best way to fold them is inside out, that way the creases that ensue will be easier to get out when you unpack. Bundle wrapping is another great option if you don't mind getting your clothes slightly creased.For bundle wrapping, lay out a large piece of clothing on a clean surface like a table. This article of clothing could be a jacket, winter coat, large sweater. Lay clothes on top of the large article one by one. Start with the next largest size of clothes and work towards the middle, until you are laying down your smallest articles. Finally, take one end of the largest article on the bottom in your hands. Begin to roll until all of the clothes are wrapped tightly together in one bundle. You can add a scrunchy, or a few rubber bands over the bundle to keep it secure.  Like books, the weight of clothes can be greatly underestimated. Because of this, it is best to pack your clothes into many smaller boxes rather than a few large boxes. If not, the bottoms can fall out of the boxes, and they can be very hard to carry.When you are purchasing/borrowing boxes to use, try and get 12X12 inch boxes. Any larger than that can be hard to carry. Lift your boxes occasionally as you pack. This will give you a feel for how heavy they are getting and when to move onto a new box.  This is probably the cheapest way to move your clothes if you already own suitcases. Simply fold them neatly, placing them one over the other. Try to keep pants/shorts on the bottom of the suitcase, leaving room at the top for shirts and dresses.If you can, use suitcases with wheels. They will be much better to move, both into your moving vehicle, and into your new house. Be careful not to pack delicate garments tightly in a suitcase. You can either pack them loosely, or use another method of packing. Suitcases are best designed to transport t-shirts, jeans, and shorts, all of which can be ironed later on.  When you are trying to transport dress shirts, pants, dresses, etc. you need a way to keep them from getting wrinkled. Wardrobe boxes are tall, with handles on both sides, and are equipped with a hanging rack at the top. They allow you to hang your clothes on hangers, thereby not having to fold them. This way you also will have most of your clothes hangers packed as well, and put to good use.Find wardrobe boxes with a metal pole rather than the cardboard ones. Especially if you want to hang a lot of clothes in the box, the metal rack will hold up better over time, and can be reused later. Wardrobe boxes are rather expensive. If you can, limit their use. Only buy one or two, and only place your most precious articles in them.  Garbage bags are a cheap, easy way to protect your hanging clothes. Cut a hole at the bottom of a garbage bag with a pair of scissors; one large enough to get hangers through. Slide your clothes on hangers through the hole. Tie the bag in a knot at the bottom of your clothes, and secure the top with a zip-tie.Vacuum sealed bags are another great option. They are found pretty cheaply at most department stores and will provide you with a little extra space as you pack. Place your clothes in the vacuum sealed bags, either folded or laid flat, depending on the size of your bags. Seal the top of the bag off (usually come with a plastic zipper). Attach the hose of a vacuum cleaner to the bag and suck out the air. Once the excess air has been eliminated, you will now have fairly thin bags of clothes which can be packed in suitcases or boxes.  Each of the labels should have: season, size, type (clothes, jackets, coats, undergarments, etc.), who it belongs to, and where it is going in the new house. You can buy pre-made labels for moving, or use some labels from when you last wrapped Christmas packages. Taping a piece of paper onto the box is another great option. Make sure that you use enough tape to secure the label.Completely cover the labels in clear tape. This will protect it from rain damage if your boxes are left out in the rain. You will still be able to see the label clearly. Write the labels in a dark pen, or a magic marker. This way the label won't rub off in between when it is shipped.  This will prevent your clothes from getting dirty. Use shoeboxes to pack your shoes if you still have them. You can stack the shoeboxes on top of one another in a larger box.Stuff shoes with socks or paper to ensure they keep their form and do not get crushed if you are packing them without shoeboxes. This will also prevent them from scuffing one another. Alternate the position of your shoes in the boxes to save space.  If you are making a short move, there is no need to pack everything. For example, if you are only moving a few streets away, you can lay down your clothing, still on the hangers, in the backseat of your car. You can also be more lenient with how much you take at once. Only take a few boxes over at once. Take the clothes which you won't need anytime soon over to your new house first., Place all of the same types of materials in the same box. Whether it be silks, cottons, polyesters, wools, etc. Each type of fabric needs a different treatment, has a different thickness, and different susceptibilities to creasing. When you get to your new house, it will be much easier to sort out your clothes this way, and prioritize which ones need to come out first.Woolen fabrics are generally thicker, and less susceptible to creasing. To pack away these clothes, fold them like normal, and place them in one over the others. You might want to place a paper towel in between each of them so that they do not tangle and knot together. You might also consider getting a few extra boxes to accommodate the thickness of the fabric. Silks and cottons are thinner and easily creased. You can fold them and place them into boxes if you don't mind the creases. There is always the option to iron your clothes once you move into your new home. However, if you don't want them to get creased, you can place each of the articles on hangers, and drape a plastic clothing bag over top. Hang them in your moving vehicle when you get ready to move. Polyesters and other synthetics can be crammed into boxes. They are fairly thin and don't crease easily. Fold them up like any other normal clothes and place them in boxes one on top of the other.  You will not need those items right away, and you can mark the boxes and bags so that you unpack them last. For instance, if you moving in the beginning of summer, you can pack up your fall sweaters and winter coats from the start. If you are moving in the middle of January, pack away your short sleeve t-shirts and shorts.   If you are packing in one of those in between months, leave some clothes that you might use near the top of the box.Pack away your specialty clothes as well. This includes hiking clothes, swim trunks, etc. Chances are, before a big move, you will not be traveling to use these items.  In separate boxes pack summer, fall, winter, and spring clothes. Summer and spring clothes are generally lighter, and can be packed tightly together. These clothes are somewhat easier to crease, so you can leave a few special pieces on hangers. However, you need to remain efficient with your space, so choose wisely. Winter and fall clothes are thicker, and less likely to crease. You will need more boxes, but you won't need many hanger if at all.Make sure to label each box. You do not want to have to go searching through every single box to find what you need. Prioritize certain clothes depending on where you are planning on living. If you are moving up north, pack your winter clothes first. That way when you get there those boxes will be ready for you. If you are moving southward, pack your summer/spring clothes first.  Place all large items in one box, and smaller items in another. For example, pack your sweaters, jackets, coats, jeans, etc. in one box. Pack underwear, socks, gloves, earmuffs, leggings, etc. into a smaller box. Because you will be mixing and matching here, depending on size, make sure you write a clear label on the outside of your box about the contents.Maintain a list as you are packing to make writing the label that much easier. Combine this method with other methods. For example, pack together large items which are used solely during winter time. Smaller items which are all silk. This will make it much easier when it comes time to unpack.  Pack together all of your pants into one box. Gather together all of your underwear and place them in another. Have a separate box for only dress shirts. This method is designed for a quick moving time. If you are planning on having a longer move-in time, it is best to try one of the other methods which allow you to pack a wide array of clothes together in one box. 

lay out and sort your clothes.  get rid of unnecessary items.  put aside clothing you will need immediately.  use old clothing to package breakable items.  leave some items in your dresser drawers.  fold and/or bundle your clothes.  pack your clothes into small boxes.  use your luggage to transport your clothes.  utilize wardrobe boxes.  place your clothes in garbage, or vacuum sealed bags.  put labels on your boxes.  pack shoes separately from your clothing.  transport your clothing without packing.  group your clothes by material.  pack your out of season clothing first.  organize your clothes by season.  separate your clothes by size.  divide your clothes based on purpose. 

 These can be extremely helpful for learning what types of projects are typically successful on the site. The most important aspect of starting a project is making sure there are “definable expectations”. Donors should be able to clearly understand the goals and expectations of your project.   Kickstarter does not allow funding of charities, causes, or general business projects. The site is strictly for creative projects for artists, designers, writers, filmmakers, illustrators, and musicians. You can learn more about How to Start a Project on Kickstarter here.; , Many donors will be encouraged to donate to your project if you are offering interesting, once-in-a-lifetime rewards. For example, most rewards will be something associated with project such as copy of the CD, painting, or illustration etc., you are creating. The more creative you are with offering rewards, the more donors you will be able to attract.  Most people that donate to projects on Kickstarter are compelled to do so because of the story behind the project and project creator. People want to have a good idea of whom they are donating to. Providing potential donors with info on who you are, what your ideals are, and what exactly your goals for your project are will greatly increase the chances of encouraging donations.  If your project has distinct stages of development, you may be able to split funding into multiple projects. This can make it easier to reach funding goals for each stage of your project. #*This is can essentially allow you to extend the amount of time your project is able to receive funding and also allow you to start creating the first stage of your project to use as incentive for potential donors during the next stage.  All projects on Kickstarter have a dollar amount funding goal and a time limit from 1 to 90 days. Don’t just expect to receive your funding in 1 or 10 days. If you are realistically able to wait the full 90 days before starting your project, that will be your best chance of receiving 100% of your funding goals. Remember, no money will change hands if you do not meet your funding goals.  Setting your dollar amount too low may scare off donors who are unsure whether the funding is enough to actually complete the project. Setting it too high may result in not being able to fulfill your funding goals.  If you are not successful with one idea, you may be successful with another. While you can only submit one project at a time, you can have multiple projects on the site at once.  Some potential donors may be unsure of who you are and not full confident in you as a project creator.   This is why it can be extremely helpful to create personal, first-person videos introducing yourself. It’s also important to answer any questions that potential donors may ask you. If donors ask you questions and you do not respond, the chances are they will decide not to donate.  

review kickstarter project guidelines and requirements.  offer rewards to attract donors, which are required when posting a project on kickstarter.  tell a compelling story.  split project funding into stages.  set realistic funding goals and deadlines for your projects.  it is also necessary to set a realistic dollar amount.  you can start as many projects on kickstarter as you want.  create a first-person video and answer donor questions; people like feeling like they know whom they are donating to. 

 You can use any of the major web browsers to access the Inspect Element function. This will allow you to disable certain elements of a website, potentially including the survey.  Choose "Inspect Element" from the drop down menu. This will open a developer window at the bottom of the browser. As you move the mouse over different parts of the website, you will see different objects highlighted on the screen.  As you highlight different parts, look for the words “survey” and “overlay” in code. These are the elements that are blocking you from the content on the page.  You will need to right-click the entries in the code, as opposed to right-clicking on the objects in the website. Select “Disable element” or “Delete node” to remove that object from the website.  Besides removing the survey itself, you’ll have to remove the overlay which prevents you from interacting with the content underneath. Removing the overlay will “lighten” the page, allowing you to click objects underneath the overlay.Deleting the overlay can cause your scroll bars to be removed. You can work around this by using a mouse with a scrolling function.  

visit a website with a survey.  right-click on the survey.  look for “survey” and “overlay” entries.  right-click on the entries you want to disable.  repeat this for all survey elements. 

 You can preserve your own patience going into homework time by making sure you and your child are on the same page. Sit down with your child and talk about what they need to work on this school year. Then, map out a plan that makes sure they can do the homework that is assigned and cover other important skillsets in the specified amount of time.Think about what has worked in the past, or what may have been helpful for their siblings at that age. Include your child in this plan, talking to them about what time they prefer to do homework and which aids are more helpful.  You and your child are both less likely to become frustrated when you know what to expect. Set a consistent schedule for homework, on weekdays and weekends. Stick to this plan as closely as you can. That way, your child has structure around their homework time just as they do at school., For small children especially, homework time may require a lot of guidance. Situate them in an environment where you can supervise their work. The area must also be quiet enough to help them focus.A popular place in many homes for homework is the kitchen or dining room table. Make sure the area is well-lit, stocked with the necessary supplies, and free of distractions like the television or toys. Ask other family members to steer clear of the area during homework time whenever possible.  Plan out each night’s (or week’s) homework assignments and ask your child what they think is the best way to divide up big tasks.Working on one aspect of a project at a time reduces frustration and builds confidence as they move along.  If you’re not a natural teacher, you might struggle with explaining new concepts to a kindergartner or first-grader. You’re less likely to grow impatient with your child when you have practical aids on hand to help them learn new topics.   Find out what skills your child is learning and research books, toys, and online videos that may assist them. One free online resource for homework help is HippoCampus.org. It features educational video content in over 13 subjects.Every child has their own learning style, so using a variety of learning methods may assist children who learn better through hands-on or auditory approaches. 

work together to decide on a plan.  be consistent.  choose a distraction-free environment.  suggest “chunking.” you and your kid are less likely to feel impatient about big projects when you break them down into manageable chunks.  use helpful study aids. 

 The first step in becoming more efficient is to figure out how you can best spend your time. To do that, you need to set some clear goals. Establishing your priorities is the best way to do that, as it requires you to think about what is most important to you.Ask yourself several questions in order to determine your priorities. They can be big questions, such as "What are the most important parts of my life?" or "What is the most important thing I want to accomplish?" Consider your emotions when you are thinking about your priorities. Ask yourself, "What makes me happy?" and "Who do I respect?"; , Once you have thought about your priorities, you are ready to set some specific goals. Make sure they relate to your priorities. For example, if your priority is "Have a fulfilling career", a good goal would be "Getting into a good college."Set big goals, such as college, and smaller goals, such as getting good grades this semester. This will help you keep the big picture in mind while focusing on more immediate tasks. Set long term goals and short term goals. You could say, "I will have a great relationship with my family" for a long term goal. Your short term goal could be, "I will spend time with my family this weekend."  , An important part of goal setting is to figure out how you will accomplish your goals. In order to be efficient, you need to be organized, and a well thought out plan is a big step in that direction. When you make your plan, set goals and steps that are both specific and realistic.If your goal is to get into a good college, break that down into manageable steps. For example, one of your steps could be to write a good application essay. Make a plan for how to accomplish this. Schedule time to brainstorm and pick a topic. Then do some research. Then write a draft. Ask for feedback. Polish your essay. These steps are clear, realistic, and will help you make progress towards your larger goal.  When you're setting goals, be realistic. That includes remembering that you are human, and might make mistakes. It also means realizing that things won't always go your way. When you set your goals, include alternative thoughts and plans.If your goal was to make the varsity basketball team but you ended up on the junior varsity squad, that's ok. Adjust your goals so that you make the most of this alternate experience. Slip-ups can be motivating. If you didn't make the team this time, use that as motivation to include some extra practice time when you set your goals for next year.  

establish priorities.  define your goals.  make a plan.  plan for multiple outcomes. 

; ,,, Although all Amazon orders (minus those due to digital downloads) are A-to-Z applicable at this time, if you've previously submitted seller feedback, this button will vanish and not be shown to you.  If the category of request contains subcategories that the guarantee requires you to explain, you'll have to select this information to from the drop-box below the top box.   Each category will yield different input information to display. "Other" and subcategory "other" will yield the full existential input fields for the type of request. Type your reason into the box underneath the second other, if both reasons are "other" or, the top-level category is labelled "other". , This line shouldn't ever need to be corrected, as this is the information that was supplied by the seller of the item.  This will include the delivery type, confirmation number of the package back to the seller, along with the shipment/postmark date. If the return requires an RMA to the seller, provide it in the box marked "Return authorization number".  Provide your hefty reason in the box labelled why you feel the guarantee refund should be granted.

 The item should be no larger than your thumb. Flat items are best, but you can use a slightly-raised item, such as a button or cabochon. Here are some items that make great pins:   Cabochons Decorative buttons (such as coat buttons) Embroidered patches Metal bottle caps Wooden shapes  , Soak a cotton ball or tissue with rubbing alcohol and run it across the back of the item. This will get rid of any oils or dirt that might prevent the glue from sticking properly.  When you place the safety pin behind your found object, you should not see it sticking out.  You can use hot glue, but super glue or epoxy glue will work even better.  Flip the object over, so that the back is facing you. Quickly press the safety pin onto the back. Try to align it horizontally, and make it as centered as possible.  If you are using hot glue, this will only take a few minutes. If you are using super glue or epoxy glue, this may take several hours.  

find something small, light, and with a flat back.  wipe the back of the object with rubbing alcohol.  find a flat backed safety pin that is a little bit narrower than your item.  draw a line of glue along the back of the pin.  press the back of the safety pin into the glue.  let the glue set before you use it.

 If you are a prideful person, you may have trouble admitting when you’re wrong. In a way, everyone has some difficulty taking ownership for mistakes. You might deny responsibility because the act of “being wrong” doesn’t align with your self-concept. But admitting you’re wrong is not a weakness—it’s simply a part of being human.Learn to admit the mistake, and apologize/rectify when you’re wrong. Simply say, “I apologize; that was my mistake.” Doing so will help you retain relationships and may even benefit your personal growth.; , In a way, excessive pride places you on shaky ground because you’re always fearful of losing favor or status. Because of this instability, you might be quick to defend. Defensiveness makes you appear inflexible and insecure. It also shuts down the lines of communication.   Instead of jumping to defensiveness, pause. Don’t follow your instincts, which are to defend. Take a few deep breaths. Agree—to a degree—by saying “Yes, and…” This is preferable to “Yes, but,” which comes off as defensive. Then, try to work with the other person to brainstorm an effective solution that doesn’t jeopardize the relationship.Do you best to develop a curious attitude and to take in others’ points of view. Work on accepting criticism as a learning experience. Taking things personally makes it difficult to reflect and improve.  Mindfulness allows you to slow down and connect with the present moment. It brings awareness to your thoughts and can help you notice your prideful thoughts and reactions. Start a mindfulness practice to notice and eventually accept those parts of yourself.You can activate mindfulness during times when your pride is in control. For example, you feel threatened by a coworker who is doing outstanding work. You might slow down and tune into your thoughts and feelings. Remember that you don't have to see others' success as a threat. Think of ways you can learn from the person instead. It can help to celebrate the success of others.  

own up to your mistakes.  lose the defensiveness.  practice mindfulness.

 If you've read up on SCD and believe it could provide you some relief from your symptoms, get advice from your doctor on whether SCD is right for you. SCD primarily works by starving bacteria in your intestines. If this is not the source of your digestive troubles, SCD may not work and could even damage your health.Although many people do lose weight on SCD, it is not a weight loss diet, and is not promoted as such. Rather, it's a healing diet that is designed to remedy digestive problems and help improve your digestive processes. Get advice from your doctor particularly if you have been diagnosed with a chronic digestive disease or disorder and are currently on prescription medication to treat it. The diet may interfere with your medication, or with other treatments.; , Since SCD is a trademarked system, it is essential to buy the book Breaking the Vicious Cycle: Intestinal Health Through Diet, by Dr. Elaine Gottschall, and read it all the way through at least once before starting the diet.You can buy the book online, or pick up a copy at most major bookstores. You also may be able to find a copy of the book at your local library. The official website for the book, www.breakingtheviciouscycle.info, has a list of places where the book is available for purchase. It's probably a good idea to read through the book once just to get a general idea of the diet and what it entails. Then, if you've decided you want to try it, go through it again and take notes.  The SCD is a strict diet plan that must be followed exactly if you expect to see any results. After you've read the book, go through your fridge and pantry and get rid of any foods that aren't allowed, so you won't be tempted.You can find a legal/illegal list online. You may want to print it up so you can use it as a guide while you go through your kitchen. Keep in mind that in addition to food, there also may be seasonings and spices that you'll need to avoid, especially during the first few weeks you're on the diet. If you live with other people who will not be following SCD, you may want to separate their foods from yours and keep them out of sight so you won't be tempted to eat them, especially in the first days when the diet is the most restrictive.  In addition to the official website associated with the book, there are numerous websites and blogs where you can find information about the SCD, including recipes and blogs that describe other people's experiences on the diet.There are some resources listed on the official website for the book, and also some testimonials. Another comprehensive online source for SCD information is www.scdiet.org, which includes links to support groups and detailed background information on SCD if you want to do more research before you commit. While you're deciding whether to start the diet, it's just as important to read negative experiences as it is to read positive ones. There is another book, Recipes for the Specific Carbohydrate Diet™, by Raman Prasad, that will come in handy once you complete the intro diet and start adding new foods. Many of these recipes are included on the website associated with the book, found at www.scdrecipe.com. You also may find helpful information on websites operated by nonprofit organizations and medical groups dedicated to assisting people with various digestive disorders.  The SCD requires you to make many of the things you'll be eating at home. It's typically more convenient to buy the necessary ingredients and make your basic foods in batches. Then you can refrigerate or freeze them and they'll be ready for you throughout the week.Go through the intro diet and the recipes included, and make your list. Focus on whole foods, because you'll have to prepare them specially. For example, you should get whole carrots and peel them yourself rather than buying carrot sticks or other prepared carrots. You'll need several bottles of pressed apple cider or grape juice, since these are the only drinks you're allowed during the intro diet apart from water. Look for large packages of chicken legs and thighs, since you'll need these to make your chicken soup.  Homemade yogurt is one of the staples of the SCD. Because the SCD starves the bad bacteria in your gut, yogurt is essential to introduce good bacteria to replace the harmful bacteria.You can make homemade yogurt in your oven without needing any special supplies other than a large pot and a thermometer. Pour one or two quarts (liters) of milk into the pot and heat to 180 degrees Fahrenheit (about 82 degrees Celsius). The milk must be heated to this temperature to sterilize it. You can use cow milk or goat milk. When you've heated the milk to the correct temperature, turn the heat off and allow it to cool to 70 degrees Fahrenheit (about 21 degrees Celsius). Stir it as it cools, covering it with a towel when not stirring it. If you want smoother yogurt, pour the cooled milk through a sieve to get rid of the skin that forms on the top of the milk. In a separate bowl, mix together some of the cooled milk with a cup of plain commercial yogurt. When you've blended it well (you can use a whisk or an electric hand mixer), add it back to the pot. Cover your pot and place it in the oven with a 60-watt light bulb. You'll need to keep a thermometer in the oven and make sure it stays between 100 and 110 degrees Fahrenheit (between 37.7 and 43.3 degrees Celsius). If it gets too hot, prop open the oven door. Allow the milk in the pot to ferment this way for 24 hours, and you'll have your homemade yogurt. Stir it until it's smooth, and refrigerate.  While you're on the intro diet, you'll be eating the SCD homemade chicken soup every day. You may find the intro chicken soup a bit bland, but you can add vegetables and spices to it once you get further into the diet.Put enough chicken thighs and legs into a large stew pot to fill it about halfway. You can use other parts of the chicken as well, but thighs and legs will make your broth more flavorful. Peel about 10 carrots and add them into the pot with the chicken, then fill the pot with water. You can season with salt to taste. Simmer your soup for about four hours, then strain it through a colander or strainer. Skim off the top layer of fat and you have your broth. Puree the carrots in a blender and return them to the broth.  The SCD is a healing diet, designed to starve the harmful bacteria in your gut and replace it with beneficial bacteria. In the first few days you begin the diet, you may experience severe cramping and diarrhea.During the first few days, you'll need to monitor the color and consistency of your stools. With the initial die-off of bacteria in your gut, your stools likely will change color several times over the course of the intro diet. You should follow the strict intro diet until you are producing healthy stools. The length of time this will take varies greatly from person to person. Some people only need to be on the intro diet for a couple of days, while others must follow it for as long as a week.  As you start adding new foods, you'll need to become very familiar with the SCD list of legal foods, and understand when you can start to add certain foods. Some should be added before others.The list is included in the book. You also can find searchable databases of legal/illegal foods so you can quickly find something in which you're interested rather than having to read through a whole list. You can find a browsable list on the book's official website, which is organized alphabetically.Look for your favorite foods, and mark or highlight them on the list so you know the earliest time you can add them and you can focus on adding the foods you like first. You also might want to look through some recipes and find some that you like. Check the ingredients and add those foods at the earliest point so your meals will have more variety.  Commercial juices and nut butters typically contain preservatives and sugars that aren't allowed on SCD. While you may be able to find organic, all-natural versions at specialty and health food stores, it typically is cheaper to make your own.Making your own juices also allows you to dilute the juice properly and ensure all pulp is removed, which is required by the SCD. Check the book for instructions on when you can start adding other juices and nut milks or nut butters to your diet. Generally speaking, you should wait until you've been on SCD for about three months to add nut milks, flours, and butters. The main reason to wait three months is so you can use a variety of nuts. Early in the SCD, you can only eat limited types of nuts. Introduce them slowly. With juices, you can add them whenever the book tells you that you can add that fruit. Follow the instructions in the book for making your juices, and make sure you aren't adding any sugar.  A food journal allows you to carefully monitor the food you eat as you follow the SCD. This is particularly important after you've completed the intro diet and start to add new foods.You may have a negative reaction that you don't immediately associate with the introduction of a new food, since symptoms may not occur right away. Your food journal will help you better make the connection. Also keep in mind that having "withdrawal" symptoms after eliminating certain types of food from your diet is not uncommon. Having a food journal can help you to distinguish these symptoms from a negative reaction to a new food. Certain substances in food, such as sugar and caffeine, can be addictive. If your diet included these substances you may want to taper off of them slowly before you start the SCD.  Even though you may see timeline-based suggestions, the SCD is based on how far along you are in the healing process. Your digestive health determines when you can introduce new foods, and how much you can introduce at a time.Keep in mind that the initial symptoms of bacterial die-off in your intestines can continue for as long as three weeks – even after you've transitioned beyond the intro diet and started introducing other foods. Include your observations in your food journal, so you know how your body is reacting to the specific foods you're eating and can determine when it is safe to add new foods. If you have a negative reaction such as diarrhea after introducing a new food, take that food off the menu and allow your system to adjust, then re-introduce it more slowly if it's something you like and want to be able to eat.  If you introduce several new foods at once and experience bad symptoms, you won't know which new food is the culprit. For this reason, you should leave a day or two between new food introductions so you can monitor your body's reaction.The SCD doesn't require you to add any new food at any time. You shouldn't add a food if you already have a known allergy or sensitivity to it. Keep in mind that with a healthier gut, you may have sensitivities to a particular food that you never noticed before. Even if you enjoyed a food before you started the SCD, you still should introduce it slowly in small amounts. If you notice a negative reaction after introducing a new food, take that food away and see if your system stabilizes. You can re-introduce the food more slowly if you want to have it in your diet, but you may want to wait a few weeks before doing so.  

talk to your doctor.  read the book.  clean out your kitchen.  locate resources on the internet.  get your groceries for the week.  make your homemade yogurt.  prepare several days' worth of chicken soup.  adhere to the menu strictly.  study the legal/illegal list.  make juices and nut butters at home.  keep a food journal.  observe your digestive system.  introduce new foods one at a time. 

 These beads will be your body, so choose the color you want for the bulk of the lizard. Don't feed the beads all the way down; just let them dangle a bit towards the end. In this video, the body will be yellow.  If the leftmost string enters through the left, thread this one through from the right. You'll have both string going through the center of the two beads in opposite directions.  Lightly pull on the opposite ends to force the beads up to the top.  You want to sandwich the body bead with the two eye colors. Here, the eyes are green and the body is yellow, so you'd put them on as green, yellow, green.  Repeat the same procedure as you did with the first two body beads. Slide the three beads on the left string, thread the right through them, then pull both strings to move the beads to the top.  Take two body colors, thread them on the left, slide the right through, and pull tight. This is your neck.  Again, it is the same procedure. For a little flair, you can use a different color for the center bead here, allowing you to put a "stripe" on your lizard's back.          These three beads are the beginning of the "back." You'll need to start the limbs after this.  

add two beads to the leftmost string.  thread the right string through the beads the opposite way.  pull both ends of the strings until the beads slide up to the keychain clasp.  feed three more beads -- two eyes and a body color -- onto the leftmost string.  slide the right side through the beads and pull both ends until the beads slide to the top.  repeat the whole procedure with two more beads to make the "neck.",  take three more body beads and pull them through. 

 The seals for bottles with screw-on caps are commonly called shrink bands and resemble simple cylinders. Choose a seal that can slide easily over the top of the bottle while making minimal contact with the bottle. Shrink bands can be purchased online through bottling supply companies., Slide the shrink band over the top of the bottle so that it covers both the top of the bottle neck and most, if not all, of the sides of the screw on cap., Apply warm air from a heat gun set on low to the shrink band. Don't let the tip of the heat gun come in contact with the shrink band. Apply heat evenly over the surface of the shrink band and stop when the shrink band appears to be snug. 

get an appropriate seal.  apply the shrink band.  secure the seal. 

 Cardio (or aerobic) exercises will help your body lose excess weight. Core exercises will help firm your muscles.

 Have faith in yourself. You might feel as if your life won't get any better, but know that you live in a time where you can actually be helped. You have the chance to become who you are supposed to be. Remember that there are plenty of people who went through similar experiences to what you are going through. You are not alone and you are definitely not weird. There are plenty of transgender people out there living happy and healthy lives.; , Expressing yourself in any way you want can help you cope with the situation. It could be drawing, writing, painting, or even running. Find whatever ways that can help you deal with your dysphoria. It's important to let all of your internal feelings out so you can let go of these negative emotions. These negative emotions can really hurt you in a mental and physical way. Some people try to repress their emotions and they are likely to become passive-aggressive or very unhappy. You might feel like you are broken or as if there is something wrong with you.

Do research on transgender people and gender dysphoria. There are plenty of videos on YouTube on gender dysphoria. Transgender people have an inherent feeling that there is something wrong with their assigned sex. Just because you might be a boy who feels more comfortable dressing like a girl, doesn't mean you instantly are transgender. You might be non-binary, having a gender identity that doesn't adhere to the gender binary, and be experiencing dysphoria. It can still be difficult, since society has a hard time dealing with anyone who doesn't fit the box. Understand that it is totally okay the way you are feeling and that you are a wonderful human being no matter what.   Everyone comes in many different shapes and sizes. Everyone has their own ways of expressing who they are (walk, dress, voice pitch. etc). Embrace your uniqueness. Don't let society define who you are, it is up to you to define who you are.  Do not listen to people who try to say your gender dysphoria is like BDD or it's "nothing". Your dysphoria is a piece of who you are, which happens to be uncomfortable with your assigned sex. It's the need to be comfortable in your own body and to be happy.  It can help a lot if you know someone that you can trust to listening to you and understands what you are feeling and what you are going through. It can be a real relief to be able to express yourself and talk to someone freely. The feeling that you are being listened to and understood is important.

There are people who are in the same situation that you are in right now. You might be surprise by the amount of people that are looking for others to talk to about their dysphoria.   Talk to yourself (literally). It doesn't make you crazy. Many people talk to themselves, because it is a way to release the emotion you are bottling up inside. Some people have compared talking to yourself to crying. These are methods of releasing sadness or stress.  These include binders, packers, and breast forms. You can tuck as well.  While you cannot wear these items 24/7, it can help you with dysphoria in public or other short-term situations.  

have hope.  express what you feel.  take a deep breath.  understand what you are feeling.  listen to yourself.  have a good friend.  find items that aid in presentation for trans people. 

 Marriage is work. It is a false way of comprehending that one can let go completely at home. It takes some effort to make a relationship succeed, and you have to decide if you're willing to put in that work.; , Live yourself and your needs so that you feel good in thee. Do not work too much.  Do criticism factual, sensitive and at the right moment. The basic rule for each relationship is least 2 / 3 praise and less than 1 / 3 critique.  Say yes as often as is possible.  Clarify the precise factual situation. Think about different solutions. Find the good common ground.  For example, sex, dining, travel, excursions and a common hobby.  For example, flowers, small gifts and affection. Tell him that you love him. Take him in the arm. Rejoice with positive sentences and gestures.  Work on your own negative characteristics.  Do not reward negative behavior. Stay in a neutral form or say "No".  A good relationship is based on teamwork. A good team has a common goal. It knows its way to success.  Go out of the way, if you are aggressive. Come for yourself to peace, before you communicate with your partner. Be more gentle than aggressive. Love grows on the basis of non-violence, wisdom and gentleness.  Men love admiration. Women love gestures of affection.  Live in truth. Truth is the basis of every good relationship.  Find a suitable name for this higher principle. Call it luck, love, truth, or spirituality. Connect you regularly and in all beautiful and all difficult situations with your higher principle. Live in the center of your relationship from your higher principle.  Love means to be able to forgive. Love means to apologize.  Love means to have patience.  Do not demand too much from the partner, the life and yourself. Anyone who can not limit his wishes becomes permanently unhappy. Who does not know his point of satisfaction will never be satisfied. What is your full stop?  , Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. No man is perfect. Love means to love the partner with his weaknesses. Accept the smallness in you, then you can take it in your fellow man. , Who wishes the happiness of all beings is growing in his own happiness. This is the highest spiritual wisdom.

 Run down to your local pharmacy and pick up a pack of dissolving denture cleaning tablets. Most denture tablets contain sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) as an active ingredient, which fizzes when the tablets are added to water. They are designed to eliminate stains from artificial teeth as they soak, which means they’re perfectly safe to use for objects that you’ll be putting in or around your mouth.A pack of denture tablets will only run you a few dollars, providing many uses in cleaning your well-used flask. The dissolving action of denture tablets also has an antibacterial effect, sterilizing the flask as they clean., Fill your empty flask to about the halfway point with warm or hot water. The higher the temperature of the water, the faster it will begin to loosen the hold of troublesome stains. Allow the flask to soak for a few minutes before moving on to the next step.Swish the water around inside the flask to make sure it’s completely wet throughout. This will help the sodium bicarbonate react on all parts of the flask’s inner surface.  Drop a couple of denture tablets into your water-filled flask. The chemical reaction will cause the water to bubble and foam up, so it’s best to do this in the sink, outside or somewhere you don’t have to worry about making a mess. Don’t cap the flask—this will cause pressure to build up inside.A good general guideline is to use one tablet for every two cups of the flask’s volume.  Walk away from the flask while the tablets do their thing. As they dissolve, the effervescent action will also disintegrate the buildup on the walls of the flask. Allow the flask to sit for up to half an hour, until the effect of the tablets has begun to diminish.Denture cleaning tablets are one of the safest and most effective ways to clean a dirty flask or thermos. All you have to do is wait. Once the reaction has died down, you can go over the inside of the flask with a bottle brush for a more thorough clean.  Pour out the water that the denture tablets dissolved in. Run fresh water in and out of the flask a few times to clear away whatever traces are left behind. While the flask is drying, keep it right-side up with the cap off. Afterwards, it will look as good as new!Putting the cap on your flask while it’s still wet will encourage bacteria to set up shop inside. 

buy a package of denture cleaning tablets.  fill your flask with water.  add one or two denture cleaning tablets.  let the flask sit for awhile.  rinse repeatedly. 

 Cymrics are playful cats that love engaging toys. Therefore, entertain your cat with ping-pong balls, food puzzles, and cardboard boxes to jump in. Food puzzles are a great choice because they provide the mental stimulation that a Cymric cat needs.Make sure the toys you purchase are safe and cat-friendly.  Cymrics love to play fetch; this is a personality trait that they are known for. You can also teach it other tricks like sit, come, shake and spin. However, only teach your cat one trick at a time in 10 to 15 minute sessions.When teaching your Cymric tricks, make sure to use reward-based techniques like treats and praise. Never use negative punishment to train your cat.  The Cymric’s well-developed hindquarters make jumping one of its favorite things to do. Therefore, purchase cat trees and posts for your Cymric cat to jump and perch on.Cat trees and posts will also deter your Cymric cat from jumping on higher, more dangerous pieces of furniture in and around your house.  By character, Cymrics are children-friendly and animal-friendly (including dogs) cats. Therefore, starting at a young age, expose your Cymric cat to other adults, cats, children, and puppies.If you do not have children, a puppy, or another cat, then invite friends who do over to play with your cat.  Cymrics are very loyal, people-oriented cats that love to spend quality time with their owners. Therefore, make sure to provide your cat with attention and affection daily. Do this by playing with it, teaching it tricks, or brushing and petting it for 30 minutes at least once or twice a day. 

supply it with a variety of toys.  teach it tricks.  provide it with high places to perch on.  expose it to a variety of situations.  provide attention and affection. 

 Before you start looking for work, you need to make sure you are eligible to work. There are some federal and state regulations that say you must be a certain age to work, and others that restrict teens from certain types of jobs. Find out any rules in your state that would keep you from working. You may need to talk to your school to see if you need paperwork from them, as well.Individual companies may also have restrictions about age, so you want to pay attention to those requirements as you are searching and looking at applications. You don’t want to spend the time it takes to file an application if they only hire people who are 18 years or older.; , One of the most important, and often hardest, aspects of getting a job is learning to ask for it. Talk to everyone you know and tell them you are job searching. Ask them if they know of any good opportunities at the moment. It is great to ask adults like your parents, aunts and uncles, teachers, guidance counselors, and church leaders. These connections can be especially helpful in getting informal jobs like babysitting and lawn care.There is also always the possibility that you know people who work in places that would hire teenagers for assistant type work, filing, or cleaning positions. Once you have made the initial ask, and especially if the person tells you they will check into something, make sure to follow up with them later on to see if they found out anything.  A great option for teens is to go the more entrepreneurial route, rather than seeking jobs within a company structure. Going the self-employment route gives you greater flexibility in regards to how often and how many hours you work. When you are using your connections, pointing out your interest in self-employment is always a good plan.The types of jobs you have available in this area include babysitting (which people always need), lawn care (such as mowing, gardening, or even simple landscaping), dog walking, or car washing. You could even offer pickup and delivery services (if you can legally drive) for things like groceries, dry cleaning, or other goods. People have all kinds of things that they need done, and as a teen, you may be able to offer them lower prices than if they hired an adult. Don’t limit your thinking about what opportunities might be available.  Volunteering for a while can be a great way to start building relevant work skills that make you more marketable. If you have the time to put into volunteering somewhere on a consistent and long-term basis, you may be able to build enough rapport with them that you can move into a paid position.If the business or organization you are volunteering with starts looking to hire, you will be a better candidate than many others because you already know their environment and goals well.  In today’s marketplace, online and telecommute jobs are plentiful, and many are viable options for teens. If you have a skill for writing, there are many online platforms that allow you do freelance work. As long as you can perform the writing well, your age would not restrict you. If you have any website design or other graphic design experience, this can be another good option.In many cases, you will still need to meet specific qualification standards. Some freelance jobs will require you to have a degree, some experience, or be of adult age. When looking at potential opportunities, be careful to look for these requirements. Consider learning to buy and sell things online, such as comics, antiques, or other merchandise. You may need your parents to help set up an account for something like eBay if there is a restriction, but then you would be able to do the work of selling. Online working options could be great when you are still in school, because they rarely require you to work specific scheduled hours. You would have the freedom to work around your schedule, and do extra work anytime you have days off from school.  Although jobs may be limited by your age, many great opportunities still exist. Many restaurants, retail stores, or agricultural and labor jobs allow younger employees. Don't say no to these types of jobs, even if they would not be your favorite choice. At 16, this probably won't be your lifelong job, so be willing to do something that you may not love for a while to earn a little money and gain work experience.  

pay attention to age regulations.  use your connections.  make a job for yourself.  don't be afraid to volunteer.  pursue online opportunities.  be open to what is available. 

 A two-seam fastball is gripped with the index and middle fingers on the two narrow seams of the baseball.; , Make sure your fingers are relatively close together. Your fingers can either be positioned so that your middle finger runs along the seam, or so that the seam runs directly in the middle of both fingers. Experiment with what works best for you.  Diametrically opposed just means that if you extended both fingers in the same direction, they would eventually form a perfect circle.   Think of the ball like a clock. If your thumb on a normal two-seam grip is at 6 o'clock, your thumb now should be at a 4 o'clock or 5 o'clock position.  For right-handed pitchers, this means turning your wrist slightly to the left. For left-handed pitchers, this means turning your wrist slightly to the right.  When throwing a two-seam fastball, put extra pressure on your middle finger. This will create a natural spin on the ball that will help it cut.  

start off by gripping the ball as you would a two-seam fastball.  instead of leaving your fingers there, move your two fingers over to the right.  move your thumb over so that it's diametrically opposed to your top two fingers.  turn in your wrist slightly in the direction of your thumb.  lead with the middle finger. 

 In order to execute this standard gymnastic move, you'll need to swing your arms down and bend your legs into a crouch, then spring up into the air with a sharp motion. You will extend your arms in a "T," and you will spread and raise your legs in a sort of aerial "splits." You'll reach toward your toes, but you don't need to actually touch them. Beyond practicing the move itself, you can prepare for a successful toe touch by stretching all of the muscles and tendons that you will use: your quads, your calves, your back, your arms, your shoulders.; , This basic stretch is sometimes referred to as a "toe touch" as well, and it is a great way to prepare yourself for the cheerleading "toe touch" move. Start by standing with your feet together, your back straight, and your hands hanging loosely at your sides. Bend forward at the waist, and reach your hands down toward your toes. Reach as far as you can, then hold your arms and hands steady where they fall. Gradually bend and unbend at the waist, reaching further down each time, until you can touch your toes.   Be sure to keep your knees straight. Bending your knees will make it easier to touch your toes, but it won't help you build flexibility. You may not be able to touch your toes on the first day, or at all. Everyone's body is different. Even if you can't physically touch your toes, however, the act of reaching further and further toward the ground should improve your flexibility.  Dynamic stretching is one of the best ways to prepare for an active move like the toe touch. Jumping jacks are relatively easy to do, and they simulate some of the motions that you'll go through as you execute your toe touch. Try to snap sharply through the jumping jacks – you want to be tight and precise, not loose and sloppy.  Sit on the ground with your legs out in front of you. Then, slowly spread your legs into a "V," as far as they will go without lifting them from the ground. Gently reach your arms down toward one foot, and lean into the stretch as far as feels comfortable. Touch your toe and hold it for 10-60 seconds. Then, straighten back up and repeat with the other foot.After you've stretched each side, try bending your torso forward and extending your arms down the center of the leg "V." Then, try bending forward with one arm reaching down each leg. Hold and repeat these poses until you no longer feel tight.  You'll need to rotate your hips backward as you jump in order to spread your legs in the way you want. Build strength in your hip joints before you try to toe touch to reduce the risk of pulling a muscle. Sit on the ground with your legs spread and your back straight, and place one hand by each knee. Then, point your toes and raise your legs a few inches off of the ground.Do not hold this stretch for long. Lift your legs, then lower them – then lift them again, then lower them. Perform 10 repetitions of the lift-lower cycle, then give yourself a short break before continuing. Work your hip flexors every couple of days to build power and flexibility. This is one of the most important motions that you'll need for your toe touch. Take it seriously!  

understand the toe touch jump.  touch your toes.  do jumping jacks.  stretch first.  stretch your hip flexors.

 The recommended home treatment for a stye is to apply a warm compress to the eye for 10 to 15 minutes, 2 to 3 times a day.This will increase circulation to the area and speed up the rupture and drainage of the stye. It is important to start warm compress treatment as soon as you identify the stye. Untreated, styes can last for several weeks, but treatment can cut this to just a few days.Always use a warm compress on a closed eyelid. Make sure the compress is not too hot, or you might cause irritation or burns. Test the compress on a clean area of skin such as your arm for a few minutes. If it is too hot, let it cool for a few minutes and test it again before applying it to your face. To make a warm compress, wet a clean towel with hot (not boiling) water and wring out the excess. Lie down and apply the towel to your closed eyelid for 10 to 15 minutes. Reheat the towel if necessary. Alternatively, you can wrap a wet towel around a hot water bottle. Lie down and lay the bottle on your face with your eyes closed. This method keeps the towel hot longer. You can also use a microwaveable heating pack from the back pain aisle of the drug store. Heat it up so that it is warm to the touch but can be comfortably held. If you can't hold it in your hand, it is too hot for your face. These stay warm for about 30 minutes. Some people prefer to use warm, moist teabags on their eyelids. These are small and hold the heat well, but are no more effective than any damp cloth., There are many creams, ointments and even medicated pads available over-the-counter that will help to clear up the eye infection causing the stye. Look for treatments that contain the ingredient polymyxin B sulfate, which is an effective antibiotic in treating eye infections.Make sure it says that it's safe for use in the eye. Ophthalmologists do not like OTC antibiotics because they are not safe if they get in the eye, which these ointments always do. Be wary of any product that claims to remove styes immediately or overnight. They are usually expensive and are unlikely to work as quickly as they claim. Stye treatment usually takes between 2-4 days., Although it may be tempting to squeeze the stye or pop it with a needle in an attempt to drain it, never do so. Rupturing the stye can make the infection worse by introducing bacteria from your skin into the stye.Apply a regular hot compress and wait for the stye to rupture and drain on its own.   Attempting to pop or rupture the stye can actually spread the infection from the stye to other parts of your eye., While you are suffering from a stye it is best to steer clear of eye make up such as mascara, eye liner and eye shadow. This will help to avoid irritating your eye and decrease your chances of reinfection.   Since the infection is often present before you are aware of the symptoms, it is best to throw away any eye makeup applicators that you were using when the stye developed. This will help keep you from reinfecting your eye., It is a good idea to hold off on wearing contacts while you're suffering from a stye. This is because contacts could irritate your eye further, causing unnecessary pain. Switch to wearing normal glasses until the stye has cleared.   Wearing contacts that you wore during the period of infection can reinfect your eye. Once your stye has cleared up, wear a new pair of contacts to keep your eyes healthy., Wash your hands with antibacterial soap and hot water before and after touching your eyes. If you touch your eyes with unwashed hands you risk transferring bacteria to the unaffected eye. You might even worsen the initial infection.  Over-the-counter non-steroidal pain medication, such as NSAIDs like ibuprofen or naproxen, can help to ease inflammation and pain caused by the stye. Always follow package instructions.   If you are sensitive or allergic to ibuprofen or naproxen, acetaminophen can help relieve pain caused by the stye. It is not as effective at fighting inflammation as NSAIDs.Always check with your physician or pharmacist to prevent possible interactions with everyday prescriptions.  It is important that your eyes get adequate rest while you are treating a stye. As you sleep, your immune system releases proteins called cytokines, which help fight infection and inflammation.Get plenty of sleep at night and avoid doing too much reading or other visually-detailed work. Reducing strain on the eyes can help relieve the pain styes cause while you’re awake, such as the pain caused by blinking.   Rest your eyes frequently during work to give them short breaks. Close your eyes for a few minutes and try to relax. Treat a stye as you would if you were sick with other infections: get plenty of rest, drink lots of clear fluids, and take appropriate pain medications. Do not “overdose” on vitamin supplements, as this will not increase your immune response. However, taking a daily multivitamin is a good idea for maintaining a healthy immune system. 

apply a warm compress.  use an over-the-counter treatment.  avoid squeezing the stye.  stop wearing eye makeup.  avoid wearing contact lenses.  keep your hands clean.  take over-the counter medication for pain relief.  give your eyes a break. 

 If you've just gotten back from a family reunion and your child doesn't want to go to school the next day, try to accommodate her. Let her stay home to recharge. If you can't, ask her teacher to give her some slack that day.  Don't ignore the good things they do. Show that you care as much about the good as the bad. Put their interest to good use here: if they ace a difficult exam, praise them, and maybe make their favorite meal.  Assume that your child is competent and wants to behave well. Treat them with dignity and take time to listen to them.  Yes, your child needs to know what not to do, but they also need to know what to do instead. Teach them good ways to handle strong emotions, bullying, conflicts, and other difficult situations.  Your child learns how to manage their emotions by watching you. When you're angry or stressed, behave the way you'd like them to behave.   It's okay to say "I need a break," take deep breaths, or say that you're too overwhelmed to handle this right now.  

give your child a break sometimes.  reinforce positive behavior.  read up on respectful parenting.  talk about how to handle difficult situations.  model good behavior. 

 "Chalk paint" is going to give your cover a vintage-y, worn feel. Consider it the journal equivalent of distressed cabinets or jeans. Even though it's only on the bottom layer, it's vintage powers will seep through in places just enough to give it that touch.   To do this, open the journal up. This way you can paint both sides at the same time and they can dry simultaneously. Make sure it's dry before you continue any more decorating. It should take roughly 2-3 hours to dry. Alternatively, you could leave it overnight and come back to it in the morning.  What would you like on your journal cover? Maybe some old postcards, some sheet music, a pretty paper pattern? This part is all up to you. The pieces can be as small or as large as you'd like them, too.   Take a minute to arrange them until they're perfect. If you feel like something is missing, don't settle – think of another piece you could add to bring it all together. Once it's glued down, there's no going back. Make sure you have enough embellishments for the spine and back, too. These bits are just as important.  Holding the pieces in place with your non-dominant hand, spread the glue evenly and thinly over the entire front of the journal with a foam paintbrush. Leave it for a couple of hours to dry before you flip it over and do the back (you don't want the first side to end up glued onto the table). Make sure both sides are dry before you continue.   Ah, Mod Podge. The crafty crafter's reason for existence. This stuff is like a miracle all wrapped up in a container. If you don't have any laying around, splurge for your first jar – it's useful in so many projects you'll surely be able to find something else to do with it in no time.  You now have a journal that's covered in paper and glue. Hmm. Probably needs a bit more, right? At this stage, add a few more small embellishments that can stick out. It'll give your journal that pop that most don't have.   As for ink stamps, an easy way to add them is to put them onto white tissue paper. Stamp the page, dip a paintbrush in water, and draw a watery circle around it so it easily tears out. Then place it however you like on your journal., Even if you didn't add a second layer of embellishments, your journal needs at least two more coats of glue to make sure it's sturdy and ready for everyday use. Make sure the second layer dries before you put on the third. And then voila! Your vintage-y, decoupaged journal is ready for compliments.  

brush on pure white "chalk paint" to the cover and let it dry.  gather together a bunch of paper embellishments.  glue the pieces down with mod podge, starting with the front cover.  after the first layer is dry, use stamps and paint to add depth and texture.  add two more coats of mod podge. 

 It is similar to the nucleus of the cell. The power adapter is able to send energy to boost your computer. There are two flaps on the side of the power adapter. These are called the wings or flaps. These "flaps" will be explained below. There is another little square stuck to the power adapter. This part is sometimes hard to get out, but it is the part holding the computer's power cord, which you have to plug into the power outlet.  Power Plug: This is an important part that is charged by plugging it into a power outlet. The power cord is attached to the power adapter on a small square that is sometimes difficult to take out. The power plug is very thick.  Power Cord: This part of the power adapter is secured in the middle of the two flaps which is then used to charge on the side of the computer. The power cord is thin and long.  Flaps or Wings: The flaps are a neat design feature placed on the power adapter. Have you ever noticed the charger is really long? The flaps are used to either wrap the power cord or plug around the flaps so it won't be annoying carrying a long charger across the floor.; ,, This will make it easier to to charge. , You should be able to see equipment, which can be used for charging, connecting to Thunderbolt, using USB, and which has the ability to connect headphones.

 How thick the branch is depends on how wide you want your buttons to be. The bark will give your button a nice texture. If you want a simpler button, choose a wooden dowel instead., You can use a hacksaw or an electric table saw for this step.This will get rid of the jagged, spiky ends of the branch, and ensure that your first and last buttons are smooth.  Wear safety glasses and gloves for this step.  Use a pencil to sketch lines across the branch. They should be ⅛ to ¼ inch (0.32 to 0.64 centimeter) apart.If you make them too thin, they may end up breaking or cracking.If the pencil doesn't show up, lightly score lines using a craft blade instead. You do not have to draw the lines across the entire branch. It really depends on how many buttons you want to make.  Once again, use a hacksaw or an electric table saw for this step. If the branch wobbles around too much, consider setting it down into a miter box, and then using the grooves as a cutting guide.  Pick up one of the wood disks. Choose a side to be the back. Draw 2 or 4 dots in the center with a pen or pencil. These will be the guides for your holes., Set the button down on a piece of scrap wood. Use a 1/16-inch (1.6-millimeter) drill bit to make holes through the top of the button; use the dots you made as a guide.You can use a larger or smaller drill bit, depending on the size of the button and the project. The scrap piece of wood is there to protect your work surface. Wear safety glasses and gloves for this step. If you need to, flip the button over, and drill the holes through the other side. This will help make them more even., This will help soften the edges around the button and the button holes, and prevent snagging., You can leave the buttons plain, if you'd like, or you can decorate them. For example, you can etch designs into the buttons using a wood burning tool, or you can paint them with acrylic paint. You can also dye them with watercolor paint or fabric dye.   If you painted or stained the buttons, be sure to let them dry.  This is not absolutely necessary, but it is highly recommended. Not only will it bring out the natural color and pattern of the wood, but it will also help the buttons last longer. Here are some options for you:   For something quick and simple, polish the buttons using furniture polish and a soft cloth.If you painted the buttons, seal them with an acrylic sealer. Apply two coats, allowing each coat to dry inbetween. Consider staining the buttons by rubbing some linseed oil, tung oil, or beeswax over them. 

get a thick branch.  cut off jagged the ends of the branch.  mark off on the branch where you want to cut your buttons.  saw across the branch, using the lines you made as a guide.  draw the button holes on the flat side of the button.  drill the holes in the button using your dots as a guide.  buff the front and back of each button with a piece of sandpaper.  paint or decorate the buttons, if desired.  polish and seal the buttons. 

 You will get notified of the lawsuit when the person suing you (the “plaintiff”) serves you with a copy of the complaint. This document will explain how you violated the plaintiff’s personality rights. You should read the document closely to see what the plaintiff has alleged.   The complaint also makes a request for a remedy from the court. The remedy could be money compensation or it could be a legal command (an “injunction”) to stop using the plaintiff’s name or likeness.; , This document should be served along with the complaint. It tells you how much time you have to respond to the lawsuit.Make note of the deadline and commit to responding in time.   If you don’t respond in time, then the plaintiff could get a “default judgment.” With this judgment, the plaintiff can possibly garnish your wages or put liens on your property. In effect, you lose without getting a chance to defend yourself.  Consent is a complete defense to a claim that you appropriated someone’s likeness.Consent can be written or oral. Hopefully, you have written express consent in the form of a signed release. Go through your papers and look for any writing that might qualify as consent to use someone’s name or likeness.   If you were given oral consent, then write down your memories of the conversation with the plaintiff. Identify any witnesses who might have heard the plaintiff give consent and get witness statements from them as well.  Your best defenses will depend on the circumstances of the case. However, there are common defenses that you can typically raise in this type of lawsuit. In addition to consent, you could argue the following:You were reporting on a newsworthy event. You have a First Amendment right to report or comment on any issue of public interest. This is a very broad right. It applies to traditional print as well as online reporting or commentary. The only real limitation is that the name or likeness must be related in some way to your commentary or reporting. For example, you cannot put Tina Fey’s picture on the cover of a book about dentistry. You transformed the name or likeness in a creative work. For example, if you created a collage and used the photograph of a celebrity in the art work, you might be able to claim that you have transformed the image. The plaintiff waited too long to sue. Each state has a “statute of limitations” period, which is the maximum amount of time a person can wait to sue you. The length varies by state, but is often between one and six years. If the plaintiff waited too long, you can get the case dismissed.  To understand how to build your strongest defense, you should schedule a meeting with an attorney. A qualified attorney can tell you what evidence you will need to properly defend against this kind of lawsuit.   You can get referrals in several ways. For example, you can ask another attorney for a recommendation. You might have used an attorney to buy real estate or to draft a will. Ask this person whether they could recommend an attorney who you can meet with to discuss this lawsuit. You can also contact your local or state bar association, which should run a referral program.Once you have the name of an attorney, you should call and schedule a consultation. Take your copy of the complaint and summons, as well as other helpful documents. Show them to the attorney.  He or she can handle all aspects of the lawsuit, from drafting your response to the complaint, to doing everything at trial. Ask the attorney about his or her fees. Also get an estimate for how much the entire defense would cost you.   If you can’t afford to hire the attorney to do everything, then ask if he or she offers “limited scope representation.” Under this arrangement, the attorney only does the work you give them. For example, you could have the attorney coach you throughout the lawsuit or draft specific court documents. You would then handle the rest of the defense yourself.Most states allow attorneys to offer limited scope representation. Ask at the consultation if this is an option.  You respond to the complaint by filing an “answer.” If you have a lawyer, then he or she will draft the answer for you. If you don’t have a lawyer, then you need to draft your own. Often, courts will have printed answer forms. You fill in the requested information and then file the answer.Ask the court clerk if there is a form available.  In the answer, respond to each allegation made by the plaintiff. You can admit, deny, or claim insufficient knowledge.If part of an allegation is true, then state which part is true and which part you deny.   You can also raise any affirmative defenses in your answer. For example, you can claim the plaintiff violated the statute of limitations.  Make several copies. Take the original and the copies to the court clerk and ask to the file the original.The clerk should stamp your copies with the filing date.   You may have to pay a fee to file your answer. Call the clerk ahead of time to ask about the amount and acceptable methods of payment.  Once you have filed the original, you need to send the plaintiff a copy of your answer. You can generally make service in the following ways:   You can hire a private process server to make hand delivery on the plaintiff. The plaintiff’s address should be listed on the complaint. If the plaintiff has a lawyer, then make delivery on the lawyer.Typically, you can have someone 18 or older hand deliver the answer if this person is not a party to the lawsuit. In some courts, you can also mail a copy of the complaint. Ask your court clerk for acceptable methods of service.  After you file your answer, both you and the plaintiff can request helpful information in “discovery.” This is the fact-finding part of the lawsuit, and it can last a long time. You can request helpful information using different discovery techniques:   Request copies of relevant documents. For example, you can request that the plaintiff turn over any evidence that they have suffered financially because of your appropriation of their name or likeness. Serve “interrogatories” on the plaintiff. These are written questions the plaintiff must answer under oath. You can use interrogatories to get basic information, such as the names of anyone who has information about the lawsuit.  A deposition is another helpful discovery technique. The plaintiff will answer questions face-to-face in a lawyer’s office, with a court reporter recording the questions and answers.You definitely want to ask the plaintiff questions in a deposition.   In particular, you should try to get the plaintiff to admit to consenting to the use of his or her name or likeness. At trial, you can ask the plaintiff about any questions he or she made in a deposition.  You can win the lawsuit without going to trial if you file and win a motion for summary judgment. With this motion, you argue that there are no meaningful (“material”) facts in dispute for a jury to decide. Because no facts are in dispute, the judge should decide the case in your favor based on the law.You could have a very strong argument. For example, you might have used the plaintiff’s picture to illustrate a magazine story. The story could be about waitresses and the plaintiff is a waitress. In this situation, the judge might feel comfortable granting you summary judgment. In other situations, the judge might deny the motion. For example, you might argue that the plaintiff gave oral consent to your use of her likeness. The plaintiff denies she gave oral consent. This is the kind of disputed material fact that a jury will have to decide after listening to trial testimony.  You can also avoid a trial by settling the dispute outside of court. For example, you could negotiate a settlement or participate in mediation. Both are voluntary. If you come to an agreement, you can pay the plaintiff some money, and the plaintiff will agree to withdraw the lawsuit.   Talk to your lawyer about whether you should settle. You will probably have to pay money, so you might not want to settle if you think you have a very strong defense at trial. However, you also need to consider the benefit of making the lawsuit go away quickly, which a settlement can accomplish. Mediation is a good option if you don’t have a lawyer. With mediation, you and the plaintiff meet with a third person, the mediator, who listens to each side describe the dispute. Mediation will cost between $70-400 an hour, which you can split evenly with the plaintiff., If you hired a lawyer, then he or she can get everything pulled together as your trial date approaches. However, if you are representing yourself, then you will need to get organized.   Create a list of witnesses. The judge will give you a deadline for giving a list of your witnesses to the plaintiff. You should identify people who have helpful information. Remember that a witness can only testify as to what he or she personally knows.For example, you could call as a witness someone who overheard the plaintiff give you oral consent. However, a witness can’t testify to gossip. Serve subpoenas on your witnesses. A subpoena is a legal command for the witness to show up at court on a certain day and time to testify.You should serve all of your witnesses with subpoenas. Ask the court clerk where you can get a blank subpoena form and how you can serve the subpoena on your witnesses. Make exhibits. Any document you want to introduce at trial has to be an exhibit. You can create an exhibit by attaching an exhibit sticker to the document. Put the sticker either in the corner or on the back. You can get exhibit stickers from an office supply store or from the court clerk.You will need to make several copies of your exhibits for trial.  To get familiar with court procedure, you should also sit in on a trial. Courtrooms are usually open to the public. You can ask the court clerk if there are any trials that you can watch.   Pay attention to where people sit and where they stand when they talk to the judge or to witnesses. Also take a notepad and write down the questions that lawyers ask witnesses. If you are representing yourself at trial, then you will need to ask witnesses questions. You want to appear as professional as possible.  You don’t want to be late to your trial, so give yourself plenty of time to get to the courthouse and go through security. Make sure to turn off your cell phones and other electronic devices before entering court. Some courts might not even let you bring them inside., You will have to pick a jury first (if either you or the plaintiff requested a jury). This process is called “voir dire.”It may differ slightly depending on the court, but the process is generally the same.   A group of potential jurors will be sent to the court room. The judge will then ask them basic questions, such as whether they know you or the plaintiff, if they can be fair, their jobs, etc. A potential juror will be seated on the jury unless you or the plaintiff request their removal. If you think the potential juror can’t be fair, then ask the judge to excuse the juror “for cause.” You also will get a limited number of “peremptory challenges.” You can use these challenges to remove a juror without getting the judge’s permission. You can use a peremptory challenge for any reason other than discriminating on the basis of sex, race, or ethnicity.If a potential juror is not removed for cause or with a peremptory challenge, then he or she will be seated on the jury.  The trial starts with opening statements, and the plaintiff goes first. Your goal with the opening statement should be to give the jury a sneak peek of what the evidence will be.   Make your opening statement as short as possible. You don’t want to bore the jury. Mention what witnesses will testify and what they will testify to. Now is not the time to argue that the evidence shows you should win the lawsuit. Instead, be objective and stick to facts. Say, “As the evidence will show…” and then briefly explain what the witness will testify to., The plaintiff will present witnesses first. Their case will vary depending on the circumstances, but you should expect them to present examples of your appropriation of their name or likeness. The plaintiff should also testify that they did not give you consent to appropriate their identity.   You get to cross-examine all plaintiff witnesses, including the plaintiff. See Question Witnesses when Representing Yourself for tips.  You will probably have to testify as well. You should prepare with your lawyer, who will ask you questions. If you don’t have a lawyer, then the judge will decide how you can present your testimony. For example, the judge might let you give a speech or ask yourself questions and then answer them.   Be sure to speak clearly so that the jury can hear you. When a lawyer asks a question, look at the lawyer, but remember to make eye contact with jurors when you answer. Always stay calm when you are cross-examined. You will lose credibility if you get rattled. Remember to answer questions using whole words, not gestures or sounds like “uh huh” or “hmmmm….”Ask the lawyer to repeat or rephrase a question if you didn’t understand it.  Your purpose is to tie all of the evidence together and show the jury how it favors your interpretation.The plaintiff has the burden of proving that it is more likely than not that you used their identity without permission. Be sure to poke as many holes in the plaintiff’s case as possible.  The judge will read the jury its instructions after closing arguments have been made. The jury then retires to deliberate. If you have no jury, then the judge should give the verdict from the bench.   In many state courts, verdicts no longer need to be unanimous.Instead, the plaintiff could win if nine or 10 out of 12 jurors decide against you.  An appeal is a request that a higher court review the trial proceedings. The appellate court will typically have three judges. You point out errors the judge made or that there was no evidence to support the jury’s verdict. If you win the appeal, then the appellate court may order a new trial.Talk with your lawyer about whether an appeal would be worthwhile. They can take up to a year to resolve. Also, if you win the appeal, then you might have to go through the trial process a second time. You might find it easier just to pay the plaintiff rather than go through another trial. You start the appeal process by filing a Notice of Appeal with the trial court. You don’t have much time—typically 30 days or less.

 If your annuity is not transferable, then you cannot sell it under any circumstances. Check your contract to see if it is transferable. If you are trying to get immediate funds, list your nontransferable annuity as an asset or form of income and apply for a bank loan.; , Check your contract or consult your accountant to learn about the laws in your state. Most states have laws that protect people trying to sell their structured annuity. If your state has a Structured Settlement Protection Act, your transaction will have to be approved by a state court.The Periodic Payment Settlement Act protects those who received a cash sum as a result of personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits, from spending the awarded money too quickly, which may then force them to turn to public assistance to meet their needs.Don’t try to sell a structured annuity by yourself, especially if you are living in a state that does not have a structured annuity protection law. Talk to a trusted broker and attorney before you proceed.  Before you shop around for annuity buyers, find out what the resale value of your annuity is. Hire an accountant if you are unclear on the details of your investment and its relative worth. Keep in mind that selling your annuity always result in your receiving a lower amount of money from your annuity. You will get a lump-sum payment that is adjusted with a discount rate, meaning that you'll get about 8 to 14 percent less than you would if you waited for the payments., All annuities offer tax-deferral from the time of your initial investment. Your distributions, however, are taxable. This means that your annuity grows tax-free in the accumulation phase, but is taxed as distributions are made to you. These payments are taxed as ordinary income.Gains made by selling your annuity before it matures are taxable as ordinary income. However, losses on the sale are not tax-deductible as investment losses.If you withdraw from an annuity before age 59.5, you are also charged a 10% tax penalty. However, exceptions are made in various cases, such as the death or disability of the annuity holder. You can also trade your annuity for another qualified annuity contract without paying taxes on the first annuity. These "1035" exchanges can be tricky, so check with a tax accountant or investment adviser before proceeding., Your best source for locating a potential buyers is the insurance agent that first sold you the annuity. They understand the market well and will likely have contacts for this sort of transaction. Additionally, they may also charge you a reduced commission for finding a buyer, as you already paid them a commission when you purchased the annuity.Alternately, you can search for an annuity buyer online. Before working with any of these companies, make sure that they:   Have positive, independent reviews of their services. Have excellent customer service. Can make a competitive offer for your annuity. Are licensed to conduct business and follow all appropriate regulations. Communicate timelines and figures in a transparent way. Recommend that you first consult with a financial professional before selling.Try checking with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) to identify whether or not the company is reputable. Companies with poor ratings from the BBB should be avoided.Some reputable buyers of annuities include JG Wentworth, Peachtree Financial, and Stone Street Capital. These companies can be contacted by phone or through their respective websites.  If you are having trouble finding potential buyers, or if you can't find the price you think is reasonable, hire a broker. You’ll have to pay a brokerage fee, but you may stand to gain from the expertise of the broker's negotiations. Choose your broker carefully. Check their certifications to ensure that they are licensed to negotiate the sort of sale you want to make.   Ask the broker you want to hire for a quote. If they quote you a percentage, calculate it before you agree. Look up the name of a broker you haven't worked with before. Any violations or complaints they have might be online., Try to obtain offers from at least five companies before you choose. When you find companies online, use their quote form to get a free quote from them. A quote is not necessarily the amount you would receive, and it may not include the fee that may be deducted when a settlement is reached.   When you fill out the free quote form, give them only the standard information. Your name, email address and the name of your annuity should be the only information they ask for. Do not give your social security number, bank information, or pay any fees to obtain a free quote. Give yourself as much time as you can to make the sale. A rushed sale is less likely to get you a good deal.  Getting an offer of about 80% of the value of your annuity would be considered a good deal.Do not take a deal in which your buyer expects you to pay fees out of pocket before a settlement is agreed upon. Once you have finalized your agreement, all agreed upon court costs, legal fees and commissions should be deducted from the final settlement.  To sell your annuity, you will need copies of your original annuity application and your annuity policy. If you are already collecting on your annuity, you will need your most recent disbursement check and tax return. If you have a settlement agreement, you will need a copy of that. Bring your valid government issued id, such as a passport or driver's license, and a written declaration that you are selling your annuity of your own free will.   Gather any other documentation your buyer requires, such as a copy of a court judgment for a structured annuity, or copies of any release agreements.  Investigate the various ways annuity buyouts are made. Remember that no matter what kind of deal you make, the buyer will get the better deal in the long term. You will likely be offered anywhere from 60% to 85% of the value of your annuity. With this in mind, consider alternatives to selling your annuity.   If you are just selling your annuity to free up some cash, taking out a loan might better serve your purposes.  If you sell as a straight purchase, the buyer will give you one lump-sum payment for your annuity. You will not go on to collect future payments. Choose to sell as a straight purchase if you are trying to get the largest immediate sum possible, or if you have determined that your annuity is not serving its purpose.   If you sell an annuity contract, you will have to pay ordinary income tax on your annuity's earnings., In this case, the buyer purchases your immediate annuity payments for a set period. At the end of that time, you once again collect your annuity payments as scheduled. Consider this option if you have a temporary shortage of cash, but would like to continue investing in your retirement.  Sell several years of your annuity. For example, if you are now receiving $1,000 per month for the next 15 years, sell your payments from years 5 through 10 only. You will get a lump sum for those years, but still receive your current payments up through year 4. You will then receive no monthly payments in years 5 through 10, but they will resume in years 11 through 15.   Know that this will result in a lower overall payout from your annuity. You will get the money for the sold years up front, but it will be lower than the total value of the payments from those years. You also need to be sure of the value of the future payments before any deals are made. This might be a good option if you need money now, but know you will be able to support yourself during an upcoming time period.  If your buyer makes a split purchase, they will receive part of your monthly payment. If you only need $500 a month and your annuity payment is $1,000, sell half your annuity; you will get an immediate lump sum for the half you don't need, and continue to receive monthly payments of $500.   Even though you've only sold half the annuity, you will still pay ordinary income taxes on the deferred earnings and any gains made on the sale. 

determine whether or not your annuity is transferable.  determine if your annuity is a structured settlement.  evaluate your annuity.  understand the tax implications of selling your annuity.  search for potential annuity buyers.  hire a broker.  get offers for your annuity.  pick the best offer.  gather your paperwork.  decide what type of funding you are trying to get from your sale.  consider selling as a straight purchase.  consider selling as a partial purchase.  consider selling as a reverse purchase.  consider selling as split purchases. 

 If you have trouble stopping anxious thoughts, it may be best to consider seeing a counselor or psychologist. A therapist is educated about the way the brain and emotions work. This enables them to diagnose the source of your anxiety so that you can deal with the cause. For example, a therapist can offer a well-known treatment called Cognitive-Behavior Therapy (CBT) that can help you train your brain to stop worrying.Find a psychologist by reviewing a list of approved professionals on your health insurance website. Ask friends who struggle with this same (or a similar) issue who their therapist is.; , When you see a therapist, they may offer a diagnosis of your worry. The type of worries you experience may have a theme. For example, if you fear crowds and leaving your house, a therapist might diagnose you with agoraphobia. A diagnosis helps the therapist target your treatment directly to these areas of problematic thinking.Other diagnoses include general anxiety disorder, panic disorder, separation anxiety disorder, and so on.  You can take prescription medications to deal with anxiety and constant worrying. Many people get prescriptions for immediate relief, such as the medication Xanax. Others try to take the edge off with anti-depressants such as Zoloft. Most people on anti-anxiety medication have access to both. You can generally get a prescription from your primary care physician or a clinical psychologist after diagnosis.  Herbal alternatives can be effective for treating anxiety, as well as body work like massage.Herbal alternatives include St. John’s wort, Valerian root, chamomile, passionflower, magnesium, or lavender. These herbs are known to have a mild sedative quality, helping users to sleep better. Black tea, for example, has been known to increase the brain's alpha waves, reducing feelings of stress.Herbal supplements and remedies should not be taken in combination with prescription medications unless approved by a doctor.  

think about getting therapy.  consider a possible diagnosis.  take medication.  investigate alternative medicine for anxiety. 

 Having the “just a temp” mindset will prevent you from achieving success. If you treat the job as a temporary position by not giving your all and showing little commitment, you will be treated as a temp and not offered the opportunity to stay. Acting like a permanent employee means coming to work as if you already are one. The more normal and “at home” you feel, the more you will be seen as such by others. You can get started by doing the following:   Show up on time Follow the rules Dress according to the dress code Make connections Share ideas Complete assigned tasks to the best of your ability  , You may not be expected to go above and beyond or even to do a good job. If you value a career opportunity, treat the position as if it is already permanent. Exceed expectations by doing the following:   Show attention to detail, and keep mistakes to a minimum. Your supervisor will be relieved to know s/he won't have to go over your work or ask you to re-do it. Work overtime to complete projects that have strict deadlines. If your supervisor allows it, you will show dedication to the company by offering to work overtime. Participate in team meetings. Actively participate in team conversations by giving your opinions and sharing your ideas. This will show you truly want to contribute to team success. Volunteer and take initiative on special projects. Sometimes situations arise where certain team members are required to head up special projects. Do not let your temporary status get in your way. If you feel you can truly contribute to the project, volunteer! Your supervisor will appreciate your initiative.  It is important to notify your supervisor that you are interested in permanent placement with the company. However, it is not good to keep talking about it, because you will seem annoying and pushy. When bringing this up to your supervisor you can choose to do the following:   Express interest at the beginning of your employment. You can simply say, “I am excited to start working with you and hope my accomplishments will prove my ability to do this job on a permanent basis.” Remind your supervisor toward the middle of your specified time with the company, preferably after making a good contribution or completing a major project successfully. You can remind them by saying, “I really feel like I can succeed here. If I am offered this position permanently, I know I can contribute to more team successes." Have a discussion with your supervisor a few weeks before your temp status ends. Use this time to be honest about your interest in a permanent position, and remind them of your successes. You can also ask about time-frames and notices, since you would need to seek other employment if they choose not to offer you the job permanently.  There is no need to keep asking about a permanent job. Your desire has been made clear, and it is up to the company now. Most likely the decision will be made collectively with input from your co-workers, supervisor, HR and possibly upper-level management.   Be patient. If you seem to fit in well and are the right person for the job, you will be offered the position.  

think and act like a permanent employee to be seen as one.  beat the temp stigma by exceeding expectations for a temp worker.  express interest in a permanent position.  wait for a decision to be made. 

 To stop yourself from sliding back into a situation of doubt and guilt, design small challenges that will help you become a better person.You can do this by setting a routine for a month on something you want to improve. By doing something for a month - like tracking calories - you will begin to develop a helpful routine to improvement. This will help you self-actualize forgiveness by acting in a positive way.  Try and give yourself a performance review to identify measurable means of self-improvement.   If you find yourself feeling guilty over procrastinating, for example, make a to-do list and try to stick with it. It is important to identify things that you can control. This will benefit self-forgiveness by self-improvement.  Self-awareness is the ability to predict consequences of our actions. Thinking about ourselves and our actions can help us be better people by creating a self-imposed morality. You can practice self-awareness by noting your strengths, observing your reactions to situations, and expressing your emotions.  

become a better person through personal challenges.  work on identified faults.  practice self-awareness. 

 or perhaps run-ning, walk, stand, wait.  Words and phrases are learned which can easily be translated into practical rhythms, and then eventually read.  This can be used in conjunction with word names, but this is usually added later.  The important thing to remember, is that you will need to point out that faster rhythms like 'helicopter' use shorter sounds.  That is to say that stand = 4x helicopter. Using this method, it is easy to get children performing cross rhythms in 2-4 parts, because of the strength of the word-rhythm associations.  

in this method, each note value is associated with a word (ti-ti, ta, ta-a, ta-a-a, etc.) 

 These may relieve headaches for some. You can also apply a cold compress over your eyes to ease the stress., Dehydration is a common cause of tension headaches. By drinking water, you can relieve your headache immediately and also prevent future headaches., Ibuprofen (Advil), aspirin, or acetaminophen (Tylenol) can help relieve pain from headaches.Follow your healthcare provider’s instructions when taking medication. Be aware that taking pain medicine over 3 days a week on a regular basis can lead to rebound headaches., While this will not relieve you of your pain, tracking the frequency and timing of your headaches can help you and your provider create a treatment plan., An ophthalmologist can check your eyes to see if your headaches are vision-related and if perhaps you might need glasses. 

try a hot or cold shower or bath.  drink water.  take over-the-counter pain medicine.  keep a headache diary.  see an eye doctor. 

 There are many different reasons you may want to contact your child’s teacher. They can be as simple as an introduction to addressing more serious concerns. The following are some time you may want to write the teacher:   Introduce yourself after you’ve moved or your child is starting in a new school Discuss a problem Ask questions about assignments or your child’s performance Request a meeting Inform the teacher about special circumstances such as disabilities or family issues Excuse your child because of illness or an appointment.; , Gather any information you need to compose the a thorough and professional type to write to the teacher.Having all of the necessary information can prevent extensive correspondence and also shows that you respect the teacher and take the issue seriously.Ask your child what she calls her teacher or search the school’s website for her name. Have copies of any supplemental documents ready. For example, if your child has a disability, you may want to include a copy of the doctor’s diagnosis and any educational placements documents., Use the information you collected to write a draft email to your child’s teacher. This gives you time to completely state your concerns, consider what you’ve written and make changes.Avoid writing the email address in the “to” field so that you don’t accidentally send the first draft. Keep the draft as concise and brief as possible. Keep the tone of the email personal, polite, and professional.Include a brief introduction with your and your child’s names and why you’re writing.For example, write “Dear Mrs. Maier, My name is Teresa Lutz and I am Sophia Lutz’s mother. I am writing because she is having difficulty in math class.” Aim to keep the body of the email between 1-3 paragraphs. Address any issues or concerns you like. You may also want to consider asking the teacher how you can help support her and your child in a constructive manner.Close the email by thanking the teacher for her consideration and offering your contact information for further consultation.For example, “Thank you for your consideration about Sophia’s difficulties. Feel free to contact me any time by email or phone at (555) 555-5555. I look forward to working with you to find a solution to Sophia’s problem.”, When you’re composing your draft, aim to keep the language as positive as possible. It’s easy to get upset about something when it’s about your child. Keeping the tone of your email positive and proactive can set up an open and productive dialogue with your child’s teacher.Avoid using any accusatory language with the teacher. Use verbs such as understand, collaborate, and talk. Use adjectives such as positive and proactive. Combine words in phrases like “I understand from Sophia she’s having a difficult time with math. She and I would like to make a proactive change to this and we are wondering how we can work with you to improve her performance.”  , Kids are often brutally honest and lying in a letter may be exposed by a simple slip of your child’s tongue. Be as honest as possible in your letter while maintaining a professional tone.   Be direct. For example, “I have a work trip to a museum and would like to take him with me for an extra-curricular learning experience. Could you please let him and me know what homework he will need to complete when he returns to class on Friday?”  , After you have a preliminary draft email, give yourself some time to think over the content and tone. After this, make any necessary edits. Not only does will give you a chance to add or remove text, but also can help you catch spelling, punctuation or grammatical errors.Check that the revised email has an introduction, body, and closing that are honest and as positive and proactive as possible. Read the letter out loud to yourself, which can help you notice possible mistakes or phrases that may say accusatory or negative.Consider asking a friend, your spouse, or other educational professional to read the letter. This person can make suggestions on the letter to make it stronger or more positive., After you’ve made changes to the draft, write in a pleasant and professional greeting and closing. This can help make the teacher more receptive to the letter and set the tone for a constructive response.   Write the greeting how your child addresses her teacher. For example, “Dear Mrs. Maier” followed by a comma.If you are not sure if the teacher is married, use “Ms.” Instead of “Mrs.” Avoid using the teacher’s first name unless you’ve met her before and she’s extended the offer to call her by her first name. Close with “Sincerely” followed by a comma. Consider also writing “I look forward to hearing from you” followed by sincerely to prompt the teacher that you’d like a response. Include your name and how the teacher can contact you.  Depending on the nature of your email, include any documentation that clarifies your concerns. This can give the teacher reference to the case and understand the issue better.Make sure to the files are in an easily accessible format.  You’ll need to put in the teacher’s email address before you can send it. Check on the school’s website to make sure that you have the correct spelling and format of her email.   Copy any other necessary parties such as your spouse or another teacher involved in the matter. Consider blind copying yourself to have an extra copy of the email as well as make sure the email successfully sends.  Read over your email one final time before sending it. This can minimize the risk that you forgot to include something or made mistakes.  Teachers are busy and often may not have time to respond right away or may want to consider your note. Allow your child’s teacher some time to respond before following up.Specify a date if you need a timely response.Follow up on your email or letter if you haven’t received a response within a week.  

recognize when to write.  collect necessary information.  compose a first draft.  keep the tone positive.  be honest.  think over and edit your email.  put in a pleasant greeting and closing.  attach relevant documentation.  address the email.  proofread the final draft.  give the teacher time to respond. 

 Just because you aren't a big company, that doesn't mean you shouldn't have a vivid professional brand. Here are a few points to consider:   Decide whether you will use your own name or work under a business name. Don't be afraid to invest in business cards, a logo, uniforms and a sign to put outside your home or business. Make sure all of them are consistently branded.  Make it clean and professional. Use a logo or imagery that conveys your business or service. Include details about your offering and your prices and try to demonstrate your skills. If you are a designer or a writer, put up samples of your work. Let people know how to contact you.  Actively marketing your services is vital to get your name out there, and it shows prospective clients that you're available for work. Consider these avenues:   Investigate online advertising. This could include setting up social media accounts for your business, sending emails with special offers, or signing up for ads. Pursue print publishing. Buy up space in your local newspaper, or find a trade publication that caters to people in your industry and pursue an ad there. If there are publications or web pages that compare different contractors who offer the same services, make sure to get yourself listed. Describe your services in brochures. You can hire a professional to make them for you, or build them yourself using software like Microsoft Word or Open Office. Consider enlisting the help of a copywriter to highlight your unique skills and strengths.  The right connections can make all the difference in running your own business.   Attend networking events and join organizations. If you work mostly locally, consider joining your city's chamber of commerce. Notify other contractors in your field about your availability—and find out their's. If another contractor is too busy to take on a gig, they might pass the client on to you. Do the same for them, when you can. Partner with those that can send you business leads. For example, if you are a copywriter, connect with graphic designers whose clients may also need marketing copy for their websites.  Contact friends, family members and former colleagues to inform them of your services. Ask them to spread the word to potential clients.  

establish your brand.  create a website.  advertise.  network with other professionals.  inform your personal network of your availability. 

 Use a sharp knife or a pair of scissors to cut a small wedge out of the entire roll of tape – from the outermost edge to the innermost end. This way, you'll tear the tape off in the same spot every time, and you may have less trouble finding the edge in the future!, When you are done using a roll of tape for the time being, stick a toothpick underneath the adhesive about a half-inch from the edge. This way, when you return to use the tape again, you will be able to easily identify where to begin. This method is especially useful for clear packing tape.In theory, you can use almost anything to mark the end of the roll: paper, a paperclip, a twig, a card. Use anything that isn't too bulky and sticks cleanly to the edge of the tape. Improvise a solution using the materials you have lying around your home or office.  Fold the sticky end of the tape back into the roll—not far, just a centimeter or so—to make a "pull tab" for the next time you use the tape. You can fold the tape directly in, or you can fold at a 45-degree angle for a triangular fold.  Consider buying a dedicated tape dispenser. These devices usually include a spool (which you can continually refill with new rolls of tape) and a serrated tape-cutting edge. When you stretch the tape over the serrated edge, it slices cleanly and naturally. The edge of the tape sticks there until you need it next.   Consider buying a "tape gun" for packing tape. This device is a convenient, handheld version of the standard tape dispenser. Run the tape gun along the surface of a box, and you will seal the box without losing the edge of the roll.You can find tape dispensers online or at office-supply stores. Be aware that many standard tape dispensers are designed for use with Scotch tape  , It is easier to find the edge of a roll of patterned tape, as you can visually parse out the breaks in the pattern. If you consistently have trouble finding the edge of a roll of tape, consider making a habit of buying patterned tape for the sake of convenience., Some tape is designed with black lines on the sides to denote where the adhesive ends. This way, you will not need to find the edge of the roll – you'll be able to pull it up at any point! Look for this specialty tape online or in large office-supply stores. 

cut a v-shape into the tape roll.  mark the end of the roll with a toothpick.  fold the edge of the tape back on itself.  use a tape dispenser.  buy striped or patterned tape.  buy sticky tape with non-stick sides. 

 The stone can be found in Calcelmo’s Museum, which is inside the Undertone Keep in Markarth. Markarth is located in the southwest corner of Skyrim. Once inside Calcelmo’s Museum you will be able to access Calcelmo’s Tower, which is where the stone is located.   Inside the tower you will find a study room containing the large stone with engravings on it. The stone is a large rectangular slab which has designs on the top of it with a face in the middle of these designs. Below this is some small writing which is what you will be copying to paper.; , Once you have located the stone, you will need to locate a roll of paper. There are numerous pieces of paper in the room directly behind you if you are facing the front of the stone. Next you will need something to write with.  A piece of charcoal can be found in the same room where the paper was located. Again, there is a lot lying around on tables in the room so you will have no trouble locating one. Once you have one piece of paper and one piece of charcoal, you will have the necessary tools to copy the writing on Calcelmo’s Stone.  Once the roll of paper and charcoal is in your inventory, head back to the stone and click on it to start copying the writing. Once complete (it is instant), you will receive Calcelmo’s Stone Rubbing. You can use this to continue the quest.  

locate calcelmo’s stone.  find a roll of paper.  look for charcoal.  activate the stone with the paper and charcoal in your inventory. 

 Do not study with the TV on, your brothers yelling, and your mom banging pans in the background. Go to the library if you need to. The best place to study is somewhere you can be both comfortable and capable of concentrating on the task at hand.; , Make sure you have no questions.   If you do have a question, write it down and ask the teacher the next day.  There should be one less section than the number of days you have to study. You will study one section per day, and review on the last day.  You should read it at least two times. It might help you to read it out loud at least one time. The more senses you use (sight and hearing as opposed to just sight) the more you will remember it.    For vocabulary words you should have the word on one side and the definition or translation on the other. ex. fleur-flower; pivotal-of great importance. For people, you should have their name on one side and a description of what they did and why they are important on the other. ex. George Washington-The first president of the United States and the commander in chief in the Revolutionary War For events, you should have the name of the event on one side and a description on the other. ex. Revolutionary War-The war in which the American colonies won independence from England.  If there is any information you are having a hard time remembering, make a song or mnemonic to help remember it easily.  Read through that section of textbook and notes one more time, in addition to reviewing your flashcards, songs, and mnemonics.  It can be a friend, parent, or sibling. If all you have to study is vocabulary words, you could use your flash cards and test yourself.  Go outside, play video games, go to bed if you want. Just do NOT study.  The next day, do the same thing with the next section. You will do this until you finish all the sections, and it is the night before the test.  Now that it is the night before the test, you should:   Review all your flashcards, mnemonics, and songs. Reread your notes and textbook. Have someone test you.  

find a quiet place.  skim over all the stuff you need to study.  divide the material into sections.  read the first section (both your textbook and notes) thoroughly.  make flash cards for any vocabulary words, significant events, or important people.  make a song or mnemonic.  read it over again.  have someone test you.  do not study for the rest of the day.  repeat.  review. 

; , Pour enough water in the pot so that the water level is a few inches above the beans. Bring the water to a boil, allow to simmer, and cook for about an hour or until the beans are done.   Although azuki beans cook faster than other beans, sometimes you'll need to cook the beans slightly longer than an hour.  Do this in batches because there will be too many beans to do all at once.   This is where personal preference will affect how finely you strain the beans. Some people prefer a completely smooth paste, devoid of bean skin, while others don't mind a little bit of chunkiness. The choice is yours, but either way is delicious! Some people puree the bean paste in a blender for added smoothness. Afterward, they pass the mixture through cheesecloth to remove the fine fragments of bean skin.  Make sure to constantly stir so the beans don't stick to the pan. You may need to add water occasionally if you find the beans are getting too dry.  Cook for 10 minutes and remove from pan. Store in a container and refrigerate. It will keep for up to a week.  

place the azuki beans in a bowl, submerge in water, and allow it to sit overnight.  strain the beans in the morning and put them in a pot.  drain the remaining water, if any is left, and press the beans through a sieve into a bowl.  put beans in a large, heavy pan, turn the heat to a medium or medium-low setting, and cook until the bean paste is thick, usually 20 or 30 minutes.  add the sugar and pinch of salt, continuing to stir frequently and adjusting water if necessary. 

 Use the guillotine in wrestling or martial arts when you want to force your opponent into submission. The tight choke forces your opponent to tap out (end the round) or else suffer extreme discomfort or injury.   Ideal situations for using this choke are when an opponent lunges toward your legs, when they move to escape from your guard position on the ground, or any other time that their head is low and close enough to your body to position your choking arm behind the neck.  Decide whether you want this choke to constrict your opponent’s blood flow, or if you want it to constrict air flow. This change is dependent on the placement of your arm around their neck.   For a “blood choke,” make sure to place the radial bone on your inner wrist against your opponent’s carotid artery, located at either side of the neck. For an “air choke,” place the full pressure of your forearm against your opponent’s windpipe, located at the front of the neck.Both methods will force an opponent into submission, as they will lose consciousness quickly from either suffocation or lack of blood flow.  Attempt a variation on the guillotine choke by cupping the back of your opponent’s head with one hand. Then place your choking arm underneath their neck. Place the hand of your choking arm on your other bicep, then reach with your non-choking arm toward the opposite shoulder.This method differs from the standard guillotine choke in that your choking arm doesn’t wrap from the back around to the front of your opponent’s neck, but rather reaches under for the front of the neck directly. Your non-choking arm reaches for the opposite shoulder to create a tight hold. Use this variation any time that you would perform a regular guillotine choke. You may prefer this version if your opponent’s head is not close enough or down far enough for you to easily wrap your arm over the neck as in a regular guillotine.  

employ the guillotine choke to force submission.  make this move a blood or air choke.  try a reverse variation.

 In order to solve any physics problem you must know which equation to use. Writing down all of the known information is the first step to finding the right equation. If you have values for the final velocity, acceleration, and time involved, you can use the following equation:   Initial velocity: Vi = Vf - (a * t)  Understand what each symbol stands for.   Vi stands for “initial velocity”  Vf stands for “final velocity”  a stands for “acceleration”  t stands for “time”   Note that this equation is the standard equation used when finding initial velocity.; , Once you have written the known information and determined the proper equation, you can fill in values for the appropriate variables. Carefully setting up each problem and writing out every step of the process is important.   If you make a mistake, you can easily find it by looking back at all of your previous steps.  With all of the numbers in place, use the proper order of operations to finish the problem. If you’re allowed, use a calculator to limit the number of simple math mistakes.   For example: An object accelerating east at 10 meters (32.8 ft) per second squared traveled for 12 seconds reaching a final velocity of 200 meters (656.2 ft) per second. Find the initial velocity of that object.  Write the known information:  Vi = ?, Vf = 200 m/s, a = 10 m/s2, t = 12 s   Multiply the acceleration and time. a * t = 10 * 12 =120 Subtract the product from the final velocity. Vi = Vf – (a * t) = 200 – 120 = 80 Vi = 80 m/s east Write your answer correctly. Include a unit of measurement, usually meters per second or m/s, as well as a direction the object was traveling in. Without providing information about the direction, you only have a measurement of speed rather than velocity.  

know the right equation to use.  fill in the known information.  solve the equation. 

 A rude person turns ugly in the eyes of whoever who sees her, just as someone who's nice turns into a prettier person in the eyes of everyone who sees her.   Try to be nice to everyone, but also be ready to defend yourself against any rude attitudes, since letting people walk all over you is not very attractive. If anyone is "different", avoid making fun of them or giving them a nasty, "I am better than you" look.  Even a little smile will make you more attractive. What else could be more inviting and approachable?   Be readable. You don't have to be predictable, but don't keep a poker face when it comes to emotions. Guys want a little feedback. Don't force it if it's not there. Try to smile, but don't be fake. Smile when you feel like it.  

be kind.  don't be afraid to smile. 

 If your vehicle did not come equipped with a turbocharger from the factory, you can install one on a normally aspirated motor to significantly increase power output. A turbocharger uses the exhaust flowing out of the motor to power a turbine fan that forces compressed air into the engine. Turbocharging a vehicle requires a number of supporting modifications to the vehicle’s fuel system. The internal components of your engine, such as pistons and rods, may also need to be replaced to withstand the added stress.Remember that adding forced induction like a turbocharger requires an increase in fuel to support the added air. Kits for your specific vehicle may be available that include all of the components required to turbocharge it.  A supercharger works by forcing compressed air into the engine just like a turbocharger does, but it is powered by the serpentine or an accessory belt instead of by the exhaust. Because superchargers are belt driven, they are not as efficient as turbochargers but are favored by those who value power at lower RPMs.Superchargers require supporting fuel modifications just like turbochargers. Supercharger kits often come with a bracket and larger serpentine belt to support the addition of the supercharger pulley. Unlike turbochargers, there is no need to wait for the turbo to spool. Superchargers produce power at all RPMs.  Nitrous oxide contains more oxygen than atmospheric air, so injecting nitrous into your vehicle’s engine works in much the same was as a turbocharger or supercharger. “Wet” nitrous kits inject a combination of nitrous and fuel into the cylinders and can produce more power safely than “dry” kits which inject only nitrous. Most four cylinder motors can withstand up to eighty horsepower worth of nitrous oxide being injected without suffering any adverse effects.Make sure to order a nitrous kit designed for your vehicle if you don’t have the tools or skill set to fabricate the components you need to install the kit. Unlike other forms of forced induction, nitrous oxide only increases wear on the engine while armed.  After installing a form of nitrous or forced induction, it’s important to have your vehicle tuned to support the increase in power. Taking your vehicle to a professional tuning shop will allow them to use a dynamometer to test various air/fuel ratios at different RPMs, ensuring the maximum power output at each point in the vehicle’s power band.The price to have your vehicle “dyno-tuned” varies from location to location. Dyno-tuning can free up significant amounts of power from the modifications you’ve already installed.  

turbocharge your vehicle.  supercharge your vehicle.  use a wet or dry nitrous oxide kit.  have your vehicle professionally tuned. 

 This is a great starting point for dogs unfamiliar with a class experience. Many pet stores offer obedience classes geared to particular groups of dogs from puppies to seniors. This is a great way to build a bond of trust with your dog as you learn about obedience techniques in tandem.Continue to get bonding benefits by practicing what you’ve learned once the class is over. Work on the basic commands of sit and stay with your dog. Make these exercises even more challenging by practicing in a public place, such as a park.  This test is offered by the American Kennel Club (AKC) and reflects a dog's ability to interact with its surrounding in a peaceful and productive manner. You can prepare your dog for this test by taking classes emphasizing socialization in public settings. This process will make your dog more comfortable being with you in public places, allowing you to spend even more time together.For more information on Canine Good Citizen classes, visit the AKC website. This site will direct you to class options while providing you with more information about the testing process as well.  You can work with your dog to develop agility skills or even the speed necessary to do well at flyball (a relay race sport involving chasing a tennis ball). These are also great ways to meet other dog owners and exchange information and advice. Your dog will also be happy to meet new canine friends.Note that many canine sports have age restrictions in place for competitions. For example, a dog generally must be over 2 years old in order to compete in a flyball tournament., You’ve probably already tried some version of this with your dog. Trick training focuses on teaching your dog a set of interesting skills that can be performed, such as shaking hands. Use positive reinforcement and frequent treats to get your dog to enjoy the process and learn at the same time. When you are confident in your dog’s skills take him to the park to show off a bit.Make time for a bit of a nap (for you and your dog) after a training session. Learning new trick moves can be exhausting for your pet, even in a low pressure setting., Consider enrolling your dog in a therapy program. This is a great way to help others while bonding with your pet. Search online for a good Pet Therapy program near you and contact them for additional information. Be aware that you will most likely need to pay a registration fee to get the process started. 

take a basic obedience class together.  prepare for the canine good citizen test.  train for sport.  master a set of tricks.  pursue additional specialty training. 

 Some colleges (universities) in the United Kingdom and other parts of the world offer degree programs in this subject. Attaining either a bachelor's degree or master's degree in food science is possible.; , The University of Reading, for example, offers a paid, year-long work (industrial) placement for students studying food science at their school. This work (industrial) placement allows students to gain professional experience prior to graduation, helping them along their career path.  By using the career center's resources, you can find and contact alumni who have pursued food science careers to learn how they got started in the field. You may also find job leads through listings from the career center.  This is the only professional organization in the United Kingdom devoted to food science and technology. The IFST can serve as a way to connect with others interested in studying food and as a source for job leads. Current part-time or full-time students in the UK or rest of Europe can get a discount on applying for an Associate membership.

 Your puppy will feel especially scared, because it's leaving its siblings, mother, and the only home it knows. If you are the driver, bring a trusty adult to help you out. An adult will probably be more careful than your children when the adult handles your dog.; , It will be very hard to do because your dog is probably very cute and cuddly, but this is essential if you want to have a well-behaved dog. Take this simple step will teach it that you're the leader.  Your dog should be as healthy as possible. A healthy dog is a happy dog.  Brush its teeth daily or at least every four days to get rid of plaque buildup. Clean its ears with a solution designed especially for dogs and cats. Give it a bath with a special shampoo as needed, because dogs get stinky easily. The paws are the nastiest, so pay special attention to them.  Don't forget to make your treats low-calorie and healthy - it keeps them trim, fit, and in shape. Some ideas are carrots or ice cubes. If your dog is the perfect weight, from the side it should have a dip between the middle of the belly and the back legs.  Take a puppy kindergarten class or check out books from the library on it. If you have been following all of these steps, training will be easier.  Kiss it, hug it, cuddle it, play with it.  Remember to take it for walks regularly and, if you are in a large field or park, let it off its leash so it can run around and enjoy the smells and fresh air.  

pet your dog and reassure it, and especially on the drive home.  only allow it on the floor, don't allow it on your bed for a few weeks.  take it to the vet for a checkup as soon as you can to insure good health.  groom it.  give the dog plenty of treats.  teach it simple commands, like down, sit, etc.  love on it.  give it exercise. 

 In the main menu, select Custom Night. Note that the Custom Night is only unlocked after getting both the real (scooped) ending, and the fake (defeating Ennard) ending.; , Change the difficulty to Very Hard.  It will take a long time, and it will require much patience. With that in mind, start the game.  Ballora's cue is the ballet music that chimes from her music box. The music will be louder on either side depending on her position. Shut the door she gets closest to, and wait for her to leave. She will also jump scare you if you run out of power.  His audio cues will give you the direction he is in, either right or left. He has two cues that indicate attack.   "Bon Bon, go get him!" This cue indicates that Funtime Freddy is sending Bon Bon down the closest door to you. Whichever side you heard Funtime Freddy's voice, shut that door. "Get ready for a surprise!" This cue indicates that Bon Bon is being sent the opposite way to you. Whichever side you heard Funtime Freddy's voice, shut the opposite door.  Funtime Foxy will charge to your office if you don't check the cameras enough. Shut the right door if it isn't in its usual place when you check the camera. If it hits the door, it will knock your power percentage down.  Lolbit will appear on the monitors in your room. The only way to force Lolbit away is to type "Lol" when it appears. If you fail to type "Lol" before Lolbit appears on all three monitors, Lolbit will pop up on your screen as a distraction, and will stay for a few seconds or unless it is deterred.  Yenndo is a rogue endoskeleton, very similar to that of Funtime Freddy. Yenndo will drain your oxygen while it is in your office. To make Yenndo go away, bring up your monitor, and bring it back down. If Yenndo drains all of your oxygen without countering him, he will attack and kill you.  The pink puppet will race across your office at random, from right to left. Click on her nose with the mouse to make her go away. She will jumpscare you if you fail to click her nose before she reaches the other side.  Electrobab will drain your power at random intervals. When you see a warning next to your power meter, check CAM 03 and CAM 04. Use a controlled shock on Electrobab immediately.  Bidybab will climb through the central vent to get to you. The only audio cue will be thumping in the vents.  They will appear randomly in CAM 06 and drain your oxygen. If you see a warning next to your oxygen meter, and Yenndo is not there, check the cameras and shock the Minireenas to make them disappear.  Minireenas will appear at random and block your view, preventing use of the door and vent buttons. Once they appear, they will not leave until you die or complete the night..  

download and start sister location.  scroll through the custom nights until you find golden freddy mode.  understand before you start: this, like every 20/20/20/20 mode in previous games, will be very difficult.  listen for ballora.  listen for funtime freddy.  watch funtime foxy.  keep one hand on the keyboard, over the "o" and "l" keys.  watch for yenndo.  watch out for bonnet.  watch electrobab.  watch out for bidybab.  keep an eye out for minireenas.  balance all of this while another set of minireenas climb over you. 

 Place the rice, water, and spices together in a pot. Use a spoon to stir the ingredients together well. Cover the pot.  Place the pot over medium high heat. Bring the contents to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Continue cooking the rice until it has absorbed the water.          Check the rice to make sure it doesn't get too dry. Add more water if it looks like it's beginning to dry out. For extra flavor, you can add a little vegetable or chicken stock instead of water.  Remove it from heat and use a few forks to fluff it up. Transfer it to a serving dish and serve with lamb, beef, chicken or a vegetarian dish. 

add all of the ingredients to a large pot.  cook the rice.  finish the rice.  finished.  

 Claudia has long hair and is Asian, so a long black wig is a must for this. Even if you are not Asian, you can do this with a long black wig! Extra points for ponytails.; , Claudia has one hole in one ear and two in the other, but you can use one pierced pair and one clip pair or three clip earrings.  This is one of Claudia's trademarks.  Claudia thinks things from health food stores are for the birds - literally. Rather, Pop Tarts are a good breakfast if you want to cosplay as her. Pizza is another good food choice for this cosplay, as long as it has no anchovies and none of such things as spinach or broccoli. Mushrooms, olives, onions and meat toppings are all great for this (best if it has all four!).  Claudia is an artist to the nth degree. Here are some ideas for things that she may make, but feel free to make your own objects:    Paper doll food. Best for Claudia would be bacon, pizza, cookies, and burgers.  Paper people. Extra points if the person looks Asian or if it is an elderly woman (which would then represent Claudia's grandmother Mimi, who dies in book 26 of the series).  Clay dragons. This would also show off how proud she is of her Asian heritage!  , These are her favorite books.  Claudia would never in a million years be caught doing nerdy things, and she hates studying.  Claudia's skin is pretty much flawless. 

get a long straight black wig.  don't forget the earrings.  dress a bit wild, but keep the clothes matching.  avoid like the plague any health food store.  be artistic.  read nancy drew mysteries.  do not do nerdy things.  if you have any pimples whatsoever, use concealer on them.  love children!  

 Just because your friend is a lesbian and you are female, don't assume that there is a romantic interest. Not everyone is going to be attracted to you, or vice versa. It's the same between men and women as it is between women and women. It's about romantic chemistry.   Avoid prejudice or biases towards your lesbian friend based on misconceptions.; , As with anyone who feels "butterflies in their stomach," your lesbian friend may give off signs that she is interested. Notice if the following signs are strong before assuming that your friend is into you:Physically touching you by hand or leg. Having strong eye contact, or gazing at you often. Smiling, laughing, and appearing to hang on your every word. Possibly being more physically shy or awkward than usual.  While some friends may have a close bond simply due to friendship, there are some signs that your friend may be attracted to you. Think of it like when you hang out with guys that you think might want to be more than "just friends."Does your friend seem to give pointed compliments to you often? Something like, "You're so beautiful" or "You have gorgeous eyes." Does she make a big effort to spend a lot time with you, even in group or large party situations? Do you feel like you communicate more with her than your other friends? Do you text or chat with her back and forth in the same way you do with guys you're interested in?  , You may like the attention you get from your lesbian friend, but at the same time you know you're not interested. Just like with guy friends, don't play head games and lead her on. If someone is attracted to you and you're not, be mature, polite, and respectful.Honesty in the beginning will help to avoid heartaches and drama in the future.  Unless your lesbian friend has already asked you out on a date, you may not know for sure what's going on her head. Talk with your friend to understand what her feelings are, and if it's true that she's into you.   If you have already engaged in sexual contact (such as kissing) or already gone on what you both know is a date, then your relationship has already gone outside "the friend zone." Be as kind and caring as you have been in the past with anyone you've dated.  Avoid discussing your relationship with your friend in public or in a group with other friends. This conversation should be between you and your friend only.   If you are planning to reject your friend's advances, avoid any embarrassment that may occur by talking in private. While you may be inclined to text or message your feelings about the situation, this may make things confusing or lead to misconceptions. Talk with your friend in person or at least over the phone. Direct private communication may be tough, but it will be better for both you and your friend.  When rejecting your friend, make clear that you are not rejecting your friend as a person. Be kind and gentle. Be clear that you simply are not interested in a relationship with her, and that you are not bisexual or lesbian.Be respectful of your friend's sexual orientation. Consider saying, "I respect your orientation, but I'm just not into you. I'm straight" or "You're a great friend, and hope to keep it that way, but I'm straight and just don't feel the same way."  , After rejecting someone (or being rejected), it can feel very awkward. Be mature and keep your head up. You may have rejected someone in the past, or been rejected. There is a transition phase that may feel weird, but you and your friend will move on and get over this feeling.Keep doing the things that you usually do, and avoid making this a big deal.  All friendships can go through ups and down. If you want to still be friends with your lesbian friend, make sure she still feels included in activities that you and your other friends are doing. Avoid excluding her due to this awkward feeling.   True friendships will remain even after difficult times. Make clear to your lesbian friend about what makes her such a great friend. Avoid compliments that have sexual connotations, but instead focus on her strengths as a friend. A good friend is caring, reliable, honest, and trustworthy.  Being gay or straight is part of human biology. Your lesbian friend did not "choose to be gay." A person's sexual feelings, whether gay or straight, are formed at or before puberty. Be respectful of your friend's sexual orientation.Talk with your friend about what challenges your friend may be facing with being a lesbian since society is often centered around heterosexual relationships. Understand her perspective.  It might be harder for your lesbian friend to talk about her sexuality because it is less accepted in many cultures. Be respectful that coming out and talking about sexuality can be very difficult for some people.Be gentle in how you react to your friend's actions or what she says about being lesbian. Avoid being overly critical.  Whether you have a lot of friends who are gay or not, being a real friend involves acceptance. While unwanted sexual contact shouldn't be taken lightly, feelings of awkwardness about someone's sexuality or your own biases should be avoided.   Your friend has a right to be who she is, and so do you. Allow your friends regardless of their sexual orientation the opportunity to express love. You may not reciprocate those feelings, but nonetheless they have a right to feel them.  

avoid assumptions.  look for body language.  listen to what your friend says and how she acts.  avoid leading someone on.  consider asking about her feelings toward you, if any.  talk with your friend in private.  turn her down gently.  avoid awkwardness.  keep your friendship strong.  view homosexuality as part of biology rather than a lifestyle choice.  understand that coming out as gay can be difficult.  accept your friends for who they are. 

 Now run around until an enemy kills you (you cannot kill yourself). Watch the KillCam. The icon will show up which one is real.; , Most people know that SitRep highlights Claymores, Bouncing Bettys, and grenades in a bright red. But what most people don't know is that it also highlights airdrops. If there is a care package that isn't glowing rd, then it is legit.  If the announcer recently said "Enemy has Juggernaut", or something like that, then it is a real care package. If not, it is a trap.  If one of these is supposedly in a care package, then it is a trap.  If no enemies come for it, then it is probably a trap.  

put a tactical insertion down near the package.  use sitrep.  if one of them is a juggernaut, think back.  remember: you cannot get escort airdrops or osprey gunners from care packages.  camp out near the package for about 30 seconds to a minute. 

 You must show that you have a history of observing Wisconsin law. This means you can’t have any disqualifying convictions or arrests. Obtain a copy of your criminal history.   Generally, you cannot have been convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor involving public trust, unless you have been pardoned.; , You must satisfy a series of requirements to qualify as a notary public. Specifically, make sure you satisfy each of the following:You are a resident of the United States. (You do not have to be a resident of Wisconsin.) You are at least 18 years old. You have the equivalent of at least an eighth-grade education.  You must take an online tutorial and pass an exam in order to become a notary in Wisconsin. You must have taken the exam within the past six months, and you must have scored at least 90%.You should read this brochure before taking the exam: https://www.wdfi.org/Apostilles_Notary_Public_and_Trademarks/pdf/dfi-not-102P.pdf.   You can begin the tutorial at this website: https://www.wdfi.org/apps/NotaryTutorialExam/TableOfContents.aspx. Once you pass the exam, print off the certificate. You must print it immediately, because the state office doesn’t store test results.  This seal or stamp must say “Notary Public,” “State of Wisconsin,” and your name. You may shorten your first name or use initials. However, you must always use your full legal last name.   Remember to always sign your name in the manner it appears on your notary rubber stamp.If the rubber reads "Chris Jones," don't sign "Christine Jones." You can purchase a stamp or seal online or from a local office supply store.The store might want to see a notary certificate before they will order it for you. If this happens, have them contact the state office at 608-266-8915.  You’ll need at least a $500 insurance bond to cover you in case you make a mistake. You can get this bond searching for “notary bonds in Wisconsin.” Alternately, you can ask a local insurance agent if they sell notary bonds.The bond will cost $25-100.  You can find an application at this website: https://www.wdfi.org/apps/notary/. Select “New Four Year Commission” if you are applying for the first time. You will complete the application online.   Alternately, you can download an application here: https://www.wdfi.org/Apostilles_Notary_Public_and_Trademarks/pdf/NOT100R02-2013.pdf. The application contains an “oath of office” and a “bond form.” You will need to complete and submit both.  You’ll need to fill out your “oath of office” form and take an oath in front of a current notary. Have the form notarized.You can find a current notary in Wisconsin by visiting your nearest courthouse, town office, or large bank. You can also find a notary by using the American Society of Notaries locator here: https://www.asnnotary.org/?form=locator.  Make a copy of the completed application for your records. You should then mail the application, bond form, exam certificate, and oath of office to Notary Records Section, Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions, PO Box 7847, Madison, WI 53707-7847.Include a $20 filing fee. Make your check out to “Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions.” If you applied online, then you will pay with a credit card at that time. You should hear within two weeks whether you have been approved.  Your surety bond protects the public in case you make a mistake. However, you might want additional insurance, called “errors and omissions” insurance. This is optional but strongly recommended.   Errors and omissions insurance will cover the defense of a lawsuit in case you are sued.You can find errors and omissions insurance by contacting your local insurance agent.  The commission generally lasts four years, unless you are licensed to practice law in Wisconsin. Accordingly, you will need to renew before the deadline. You can renew by completing the same materials you did when you initially applied:   purchase a new surety bond buy a new seal complete the renewal application, whether online or by download pay a $20 filing fee  

check that you don’t have a disqualifying criminal history.  satisfy other requirements.  pass an exam.  purchase a rubber stamp or notary seal.  buy a surety bond.  complete an application.  take an oath.  submit your application.  purchase insurance.  renew your commission. 

 If you don't have it, you can go to the General Store and pay 2,500 G for it.    Pie Crust: You will need to make the basic pie crust prior to making pizza. The utensil needed is a knife (1,500 G) and ingredients needed are wheat flour and butter. Cheese: You can process milk in a cheese maker (purchased from the General Store for 4,200 G). Shrimp: You can catch and use a crawfish, freshwater prawn, or rock lobster Squid: You can catch squid around Toucan Island  ,, Press the "A" button., Press the "A" button again and "Start" to make the dish. 

acquire an oven.  gather the ingredients needed to make the pizza.have the ingredients in your rucksack.  walk to the oven on your kitchen counter.  choose the ingredients that you need for the recipe. 

 Start by dividing one sheet of paper into three columns. Label one 'Reason', another 'What?', and the last one, "Improvement". Seeing what is distracting you will help you improve your grades in any subject whether it is hard or easy.; , Are you doing your homework? Are you spending time studying for tests? Do you pay attention in class? Do you put school before social events and sports? Sit down and write down all the reasons why you think your grades have dropped underneath the 'Reason' column. Number them from the biggest problem to the smallest problem. Always work on the hardest problem first, then eliminate the smaller ones.  For example, instead of "I don't do my homework" you could write, "I don't have a quiet place to do my homework, because my siblings are too loud". Or next to "I don't pay attention in class." you might write, "I have a hard time paying attention because I don't get enough sleep." Write that in the 'Why?' column.  If the reason column said "I don't do my homework", and the Why? column said "I don't have enough time because I play too many sports", in the Improvement column, you might write "I will drop one sport and set aside an hour every evening for studying and homework".  Pick one item from the 'Reason' column to improve on. This part varies for every person. Start with the biggest problem and work your way down. If your biggest problem is that you can't pay attention in class, and your improvement is getting more sleep, then start doing that.  You'll be amazed how fast you can check everything off and how fast your grades will begin improving.  Don't be a slacker! Try whatever techniques work for you. Some people may write down that they will study 20 minutes every day for three days before a test. It's up to you to figure out how to study! Many people like flashcards, others like games, and others prefer just to read the material. Try a little of each and give yourself a mini-quiz after to see how well you remembered the material. Whichever works the best you should use everyday.  This guide doesn't tell you exactly what to do to improve your grades. You need to be a judge of that yourself. You may just need to study harder or you may need to approach a teacher and ask for after-school help. Be responsible and don't expect everything to just happen overnight.  Don't stop being a good student now! Keep up your habits.   Sure, sacrificing a shopping trip or an hour on Facebook may seem horrible now, but, once you get your report card, it will be worth it.  Remember to reward yourself after completing a task so you feel more confident and you have something to push yourself when trying to get to your goal.  Studying with friends isn't always the best idea because every student learns things a different way. Find out which ways help you learn better, and use it. 

get a notebook.  figure out why you have low grades.  why are those reasons happening?,  how can i improve?,  what should i improve on?,  once you are positive you have improved, cross that off and move down the list.  stay devoted to getting better grades.  keep in mind that middle school is a lot of responsibility, so is improving your grades.  after a few weeks, you should notice an improvement in your grades if you were responsible and made an effort.  know the biggest message: every student is different!,  if you don't want people to know that you are studying so you don't get seen as a know-it-all or a geek, but still don't want your grades to drop, do your studying in your room when you know you won't be distracted by your friends or anyone else.  

 Wear heavy duty clothing, gloves and eye protection as you never know what you will encounter. Many construction companies use the city dumps to dispose of material that they can't use or that they feel is not worth reclaiming. But you won't have the labor costs involved to strip paint from old windows and doors or to remove nails from lumber that the company would have, so it could be a great find for you.  

visit your community dump if they allow it. 

 If you don't have it, you can go to the General Store and pay 480 G for it.  You can get it by fishing at the following places during the Spring, Summer, and Autumn:  The waterfall at Garmon Mine The pond and south bridge at Flute Fields  , Ensure that your rucksack is not full, or else you cannot grill the fish., Use your matches on a wood stack. Press the "A" button., Press the "A" button again and "Start" to make the dish. 

acquire matches.  get a masu trout.  have the masu trout in your rucksack.  start a bonfire.  choose the masu trout that you need for the recipe. 

 Make it as short as possible and not too complicated. If you have a script you won't have to worry about remembering what to say and you should be able to focus on the performance. You should try to follow the script but also leave room for spontaneous moments. Work in feeling and a sense of importance or excitement into your article to catch the watcher right from the start and keep them interested throughout.; , The better your script and filming, the less time you spend on editing. Focus on delivering the speech straight to the camera and never second guessing yourself. If you want, practice without the camera on a couple of times to be sure that you efficiently deliver the speech.  Try to avoid leaning over, fixing your hair, stuttering or fixing your clothes. Distracting movements will only inhibit you from doing your best. If you need any props, keep them on a small table to the side of you so that it is not visible to the camera. Try not to say things like "um" or "and" over and over. If you want you can put a full length mirror behind the camera so that you can see yourself and watch the way you move, but be sure not to use this as an excuse to fix your clothes or hair and be careful to look at the camera instead of the mirror the majority of the time.  If you're doing this outside, at home or anywhere else where there might be people or noises try your best to cut down on extra noise during the filming. Let people know that you're going to be filming and you need it to be as quiet as possible. If you have animals try to keep them out of the frame and preferably in a different room.  This is the most important step. Make sure that you are not distracted or tempted to look away from the camera at all. Videos in which people don't maintain eye contact are never as effective or nice to watch as videos where the person does. You'll probably feel a little silly talking to a camera, so take a deep breath and treat it just like you're having a normal conversation with someone. If it helps to envision someone you like to talk to as the camera than do that, whatever works you should do.  You are your worst enemy, so try not to worry too much about everything you do. Have fun and let go. If you make a mistake don't let it show and no one will ever notice, so go on as if nothing happened and have fun with it.  If you need help don't be afraid to ask! You can also find good instructions for video editing if you do a google search or a wikiHow search. It doesn't have to be perfect and if this is your first time creating a video don't worry too much about the editing.  Send it in an e-mail to your friends and family or keep a copy on a CD or thumb drive to show to people if you want to.  

start with a script.  do your best when recording your invitation.  practice good video etiquette.  keep it quiet except for you in the video.  maintain eye contact with the camera.  don't overanalyze your actions.  editing could be a complicated process so try to use simple tools (unless you are a pro), and you'll probably have a lot of fun.  embed the video on video sharing websites such as youtube or attach it as an attachment (if you've exported it into a .wmv format). 

 Braiding goes a lot faster when your hair is knot-free. The comb should be able to pull easily through the length of the hair.   If you're working with thick or layered hair, use a bit of water or liquid hair gel to dampen the hair first. This will make it easier to handle. You can braid hair when it is wet or dry. If your hair is completely wet, it will have a very smooth, tight appearance while dry hair will give a more messy look. If braiding your hair dry, it is best to do it a few days after washing so that it is not so clean and slick. Slightly oily hair will hold a braid better than brand "new" clean hair.; , If you tie hair into a ponytail or half ponytail with a hair tie, your braid will be easier to handle and turn out a little neater. Once you get the hang of it, try to start braiding loose hair at the nape of the neck.  These will be the three strands of your braid, so try to make them as even as possible.          Grab the right section with your right hand and the left section with your left hand, letting the middle section hang free (for now). In your right and left hands, hold the strands so that you're grasping them against your palm with your middle, ring and little fingers, keeping your index fingers and thumbs free.  If your strands started out as A B C, they should now be ordered as B A C.          With the index finger and thumb of your left hand, grab the middle section of hair. Using the index finger and thumb of your right hand, grab the left section of hair that's grasped against your left palm. The original left-hand section is now the middle section.  Your strands that are now ordered B A C will become B C A.          In your left hand, shift the strand that's between your index finger and thumb so that your other fingers are holding it secure against your palm. Use your left index finger and thumb to grab the section of hair that's being held against your right palm (but not the one being held by the thumb and index finger). The original right-hand section is now the middle section.  Keep using the "free" index finger and thumb of one hand to grab the "back" section of hair (held by the other three fingers against the palm) from the other hand.          Tighten the braid as you go. Any time a strand changes hands, tug gently on the hair so that the plait moves upward, tightening it. Don't pull too hard, though. Repeat until you run out of space to braid, leaving about 1–3 inches (2.5–7.6 cm) of unbraided hair at the end.  Use a non-rubber elastic to tie off the end of the braid. You might have to wrap it around the hair several times.   Avoid rubber bands. These can damage the hair and be difficult to remove at the end of the day. Whenever possible, use a ponytail holder that is the same colour as your hair or that is translucent, so that it blends in with your braid. This can make a braid look more natural, and get people to concentrate on the braid itself, rather than on the holder.  Hairspray or spray gel can help your braid from developing flyaways as the day goes on.   If you decide to use hairspray, make sure to use it before adding any hair ornaments. Use a shine serum along your braid to give it some extra glow. Rub a bit between your hands and then run along the length of the braid.  Tie a colorful ribbon in a bow at the end of your braid for extra flair.   You can use tulle, grosgrain, or ric rac, all of which can be found in a variety of colors at your local fabric store. Use a cute hair pin or brooch to pin near the base of your braid, or to hold back your bangs.  

detangle hair with a brush or wide-toothed comb.  start with a secure base (optional).  divide the hair into three even sections.  cross the left section over the middle section.  cross the right section over the middle section.  continue braiding.  secure the braid.  set the braid with hairspray (optional).  add embellishment to your braid (optional).

 Before your amp projects sound, it requires power. First, make sure that your amp's switch is in the off position. Then, take the power cord from the back of your combination amp and plug it into a wall socket. Once it's plugged in, flip the power switch to test if its power is on. On many amps, there will be a red or green light designating that there is power running to your amp.If your power cable isn't attached to the back of your amp, you may need to plug it into your amp before plugging it into the wall. If your amp doesn't turn on, switch sockets to see if it is a faulty electrical outlet. If you don't have a faulty electrical outlet and your amp still doesn't turn on, consider taking it to an instrument repair shop to get it examined.; , You can purchase a guitar cable at most music stores. Guitar cables are typically called instrument cables or a 1/4” cable. These cables have a plug that fits into your input jack on your combination amp and is what allows the guitar to play through the amp's speakers. The guitar's jack should be on the front of the guitar or the edge of the guitar and will look like a metallic socket.Popular guitar cable brands include Planet Waves American Stage Guitar and Instrument Cable, Monster S100-I-12 Standard 100 1/4-Inch Instrument Cable, and George L's 155 Guage Cable.You can also purchase 1/4" instrument cables online.  Turning down the volume and the gain will prevent feedback and will stop you from blowing out your speaker when you plug in your guitar., Take the other end of your guitar's cable and plug it into the input jack on your amplifier.Your guitar should be directly connected to the combo amp with your instrument cable.  Adjust the volume and gain knobs on your amp until your guitar reaches a suitable volume. You can test the volume of your guitar by strumming an open string as you adjust the knob on your amp.You can use the knobs on your instrument to reduce gain and volume as you play instead of having to walk over your amp.  Test other knobs on the guitar like bass, mid, and treble knobs. Start these knobs off in the 12 o'clock position to give your guitar a default tone. Then, start to adjust the different knobs and play your guitar until it reaches the sound that you desire.Your combo amp may already have built-in distortions like overdrive. Test the different features of your amp. If your tone isn't thick or full enough, experiment with bringing up your amp's bass knob. If your guitar's tone is too muddy or muffled, consider turning down the bass and the mid while turning up the treble. All amps are different, so there isn't a particular preset that you can use on all amps.  

connect the amp's power cord to the wall.  plug your guitar cable into your guitar.  turn the volume and gain on the amp down.  plug the other end of the cord into the input jack.  turn your amp on and turn the volume and gain up.  test other knobs on your combo amp. 

 It is very hard to improve your skills if you never put them to the test.; , Make sure that whenever you get ready to take a typing test take deep breath and position your fingers on the right keys.

 It is a common mistake to try to clean white Keds using bleach, but bleach can actually cause canvas to turn yellow. These stains may be permanent, but there are a few techniques you can try before giving up.   Mix half a cup of cream of tartar with a quart of hot water. Soak your Keds in this overnight. You can also try making a paste out of baking soda and water. Apply this paste to the canvas, and leave it overnight. Clean as usual the next day. Applying hydrogen peroxide directly to the stains may also help. If it doesn’t work at first, try a few more applications., Salt stains may appear on your shoes during winter if the streets and sidewalks are salted. To remove salt stains, mix one part vinegar with two parts water. Using a paper towel or white cloth, blot the stain with the mixture. Take another clean cloth dampened with just water, and dab the vinegar away. Let them dry completely before wearing., Mold and mildew can form if your Keds became wet and dried improperly. To get rid of mold and mildew, mix equal parts water and rubbing alcohol. Use a rag or cotton towel to apply this solution to the mildew and gently scrub it away. Rinse the shoes afterwards., Mix a mild laundry detergent with about one tablespoon of bleach. Use a white cloth or toothbrush to apply this mixture to the non-canvas parts of the shoe, such as the sole and the white border around the bottom of the shoe.

 This means that if, for example, you find a rare towards the end of a tier, and you should avoid upgrading a skill that you got at the beginning of the tier, as it will be replaced quite soon.  If you solo and/or kite a lot, then upgrading certain ranged attacks first will be the best choice (see section 4.2.2. for advice on the best attacks to use in kiting) If, however, you prefer to play in groups, you’ll want to upgrade the attacks you use the most often in groups.   When choosing upgrades at the level cap, bear in mind that the last few levels in a given tier will not be upgraded in the next expansion that comes. This is due to the 14-level upgrade rule – this means those very high-level skills are good upgrade choices, as you will be using them a long time.  

when deciding what to upgrade, remember that for most skills you’ll receive an upgrade within 14 levels.  try to base your upgrade choices on your play-style. 

 Using a knife, remove the skin from the cantaloupe and dice the cantaloupe into cubes.

 The simplest way to use water to de-clump mascara is removing the wand and dipping it in hot water. Leave the wand in the hot water for a few minutes. Then, remove the wand and place it back into your mascara. Do not pump the wand. Simply place it back in the container. If successful, your mascara should be less clumpy the next time you apply it.You can use your mascara right away after using this method.; , If simply dipping the wand in hot water is not successful, you can try a more intense method. Boil a pot of water big enough that you can completely submerge your sealed tube of mascara in the water. Let the water come to a rolling boil before reducing the heat to a simmer.Place the mascara into the simmering water. Allow it to sit for a few minutes. Take out the mascara using tongs. After the mascara has cooled to the touch, check the mascara to see if it's more liquid-like and does not clump as much.  If your mascara is still a little clumpy after being submerged in the water, add a few drops of olive oil in the mascara tube. This should loosen up the mascara further and restore it to its original consistency. 

add water to the wand.  place the mascara in boiled water.  add olive oil, if necessary. 

 Learn about the education requirements for real estate agents in your state. Most states ask you to complete a certain number of real estate courses from accredited schools before you apply for a license.; , You will need to prepare and pass the real estate licensing exam in the state where you wish to set up shop.

 Speaking with your healthcare provider means letting them know more about the symptoms that you’re experiencing as well as the condition history.Remember, your doctor can diagnose the condition better if you’re detailed and do not leave any symptoms out. Be aware that your doctor may refer you to a specialist in neurology, surgery, orthopedics, or rheumatology, if needed for diagnosis or treatment.  Your physician will want to assess your wrist and hand. They will press on points to find out if there is any pain or numbness in the area. They will also check for swelling, sensation, and weakness. If the pain is intense, additional tests may be needed to rule out other health conditions.A pre-assessment where they look over the area visually is required to give indication and direction for further tests. Your doctor may also perform Phalen's test or other carpal tunnel tests in the office.  Blood samples may be requested to rule out additional medical issues, such as rheumatoid arthritis, a thyroid issue, or other underlying medical problems. By ruling out these problems, your physician can better diagnose the problem.Once blood tests rule out other medical problems, additional imaging tests may be needed.  Imaging tests, such as an X-ray or ultrasound, may be requested by the physician or you can request them yourself. By having these imaging scans performed, you can be in a better position to diagnose the problem and treat the symptoms.X-ray is usually used only to aid in the diagnosis or rule out other causes of pain (such as fractures and arthritis). Your doctor may use ultrasound to visualize the structure of the median nerve in your hand.  An electromyogram is a test during which multiple fine needles are inserted into the muscles to measure electrical discharges. This test can determine if there is muscle damage and it can rule out other conditions.A mild painkiller can be administered prior to the test to reduce pain.  This medical conductivity test is used to detect how the nervous system is functioning and can determine whether or not you have carpal tunnel syndrome.During the test, two electrodes are placed on your hand and wrist and a small shock is passed through the median nerve to detect if electrical impulses are slowed in the carpal tunnel. The results can indicate how much damage has occurred to your nerves.  

tell your symptoms to your doctor.  get a physical examination.  get a blood test.  ask for an imaging test.  get an electromyogram.  ask for a nerve conduction study. 

 Take your dog for a long walk or let it run around at a dog park before being around elderly people. You can also play fetch or another game where the dog runs around a lot to tire it out. Most of the danger of having an active dog around elderly people is that the dog might knock them down or injure them just out of excitement. In order to curb this risk, you should make sure to really tire the dog out before the meeting.If the dog is tired out, it is less likely to be really wild and uncontrollable. However, there are some dogs that will be really active when meeting new people or old friends no matter how much exercise you give them. Make this judgement for yourself based on your particular dog.; , In order to keep an elderly person really safe around an active dog, you need to control that dog's behavior. Extensive training that the dog consistently responds to is the best way to control its behavior. Training requires daily practice with your dog, clear and consistent directions, and positive reinforcement to encourage your dog to follow your commands.   With a well-trained dog, you can allow the dog to be around an elderly person unrestrained because you know that it will stop dangerous behavior immediately if commanded. Training that is very successful will allow you to control your dog's behavior no matter what it is doing with a simple command. This type of training takes a long time to complete. Don't expect to get total control over your dog's actions in a week or two. It takes lots and lots of repetition and positive reinforcement to instill in your dog.  If you are planning on introducing your dog to a family member then you can let the dog smell his or her smells ahead of time. Getting a piece of clothing or a sheet or blanket that the person uses and letting your dog smell it ahead of time will let the dog get the excitement of new smells over with.   If the dog has already smelled someone, then doing this before he or she comes over will not generally diffuse the dog's excitement. This tactic is usually just helpful for first time encounters. This technique is used often when introducing dogs to new babies, but can work with other types of situations as well. 

tire the dog out.  do extensive training.  allow the dog to smell the person ahead of time. 

 Try to put any business appointment in writing (most preferably in Italian), so you have something to show if things don't work out according to plan. It is also helpful to confirm the meeting by a call, email or a fax––anything that results in reminding those attending the meeting that it's still happening.   Try not to schedule meetings in August unless those meeting with you make it clear they'll be available. Many businesses are closed during these period and people are on holiday; it could be awkward if someone feels compelled to fly back to Rome just to meet with you.  Italian business, particularly in the northern regions, value the punctuality of others. Prompt attendance at a meeting also says a lot about your reliability and enthusiasm, so it's best to be five minutes early than five minutes late.   Should those you are meeting turn up late (Italian business people outside of the northern regions are less concerned with their own punctuality than perhaps with yours), do not make an issue out of it. Accept apologies and move on as if nothing untoward has happened. You can surmise whatever you want from it after the meeting but during the meeting it is best to appear unruffled and ready to make deals.  This helps you colleagues; moreover, it also makes them appreciate your effort. It will help them to see that you are serious about doing business with them.  This will ensure that the conversation runs more smoothly and that there are no misunderstandings. Do not rely on the ability of the other business people to speak English; that is too much of a burden for you to place upon them. It also leaves you at risk of not understanding what you really need to know.  

make appointments two to three weeks in advance.  be punctual.  have all printed material available in both english and italian.  use an interpreter if you are not fluent in italian. 

   If you want to mix colors, experiment. You might even add wearable glitter, for a sparkly look.  This is done by twisting it until it falls out.   The chapstick will help emulsify the blush, combining the oils and ingredients to make it creamy.  Use a fork or similar item to mash the chapstick into a creamy consistency and to distribute the color through it.   Use a hairdryer to help melt the chapstick, turned to the high setting. If the blush hardens again as you're making it, use the hairdryer to melt it again. If the color seems too bright, tone it down with some tinted moisturizer.  Let it cool for a minute. Transfer to the refrigerator and leave it to set for about 10 minutes.  The blush is now ready to use. Apply using either your fingers or a makeup brush.  

crush the eyeshadow into powdery form.  push the chapstick out of its tube.  add the chapstick wax and eyeshadow powder to the mixing bowl.  pour the liquid mixture into the container.  done. 

 In a small bowl, mix half a teaspoon of baking soda with the quantity of toothpaste that you normally apply to your toothbrush. Stir them together. Apply the mixture to your toothbrush., Brush your teeth thoroughly for two minutes, covering your entire mouth. Spit out excess toothpaste. Rinse your mouth out with water., As an alternative, purchase a toothpaste that already contains baking soda. Since baking soda has been used a teeth cleaner for over 150 years and is fairly inexpensive, it is present in may major toothpaste brands in different quantities. Opt for a toothpaste with a high concentration of baking soda (e.g. Arm and Hammer toothpaste). 

mix toothpaste and baking soda.  brush your teeth thoroughly.  buy a toothpaste that contains baking soda.

 Place a pillow between your knees. Lay your top arm across your side and thigh. Bring your bottom arm (the arm on which you are lying) straight out from your shoulder and wrap it around your pillow, with your palm facing you.   You can sleep on either your left or right side.  This will help you keep your lower back curved properly. For additional support, roll a small towel and place it beneath your lower back. Rest your head and neck on a pillow.   Lying on your back and lying on your side when sleeping are equally good positions for avoiding back pain.  Normally, you should avoid sleeping on your stomach, since it can be hard on your back; however, you can make it easier on your back by putting a pillow beneath your pelvis and lower part of your abdomen. If you can use a pillow without straining your back, do so. Otherwise, sleep without a pillow under your head.  

sleep on your side.bend your legs at the knee and bring them up slightly toward your body.  lie on your back when sleeping.if you sleep on your back, lay a pillow beneath your knees so that they are slightly elevated.  go to sleep on your stomach.if you do not like sleeping on your back or side, you can sleep on your stomach. 

 As you send her those signals, see what she does. If she blushes or smiles, you're on the right track.   If she seems confused, don't fret. You may just be going too fast. Jog back a bit and take it slow. If she's not reciprocating, it's not the right moment. Be patient. It may have nothing to do with you.  If you're in the middle of an action movie and she's so entranced the popcorn is missing her mouth, it's not the right time. Use your own senses of whether or not to get close and personal.   If it's not happening, create it. Walk her to her door, take her somewhere new, or learn to play her favorite song.  Look at her eyes and lips. Getting impatient or distracted (or, God forbid, focusing on other parts of her body) may scare her away.   Focusing will make her easier to read. Knowing if a girl wants to kiss is half the battle.  If she senses you're even the slightest bit unhappy, she may be not want to take the risk. Remember: she's reading you, too!   Smiling will put both of you in a better mood. It's contagious and tricks the mind.  The moment is good whether she kisses you or not. Even if she doesn't now, you're putting in time for later.   It's easy to sense when someone is nervous. Your heart will race and you'll perspire. Remember to breathe.  

watch her reactions.  make sure the moment is right.  focus.  smile.  relax. 

 Give what you don't need to others who do, or have a garage sale and give what remains to others (as long as it is in good condition, of course). Many times, spiritual unrest follows a disorganized venue. Thoroughly clean your house, top to bottom: literally, ceilings and attic to floor and basement. wash the walls (dilute vinegar or lemon water are quickest and easiest), dust, vacuum, clean carpets... and don't forget those sundry storage places like garages and sheds. Air out the house for several days if you can. With all the windows and screens now clean and fresh, the fans and ducts without dust and mold, you can literally say out with the old and in with the new air in your house. So if the weather is going to be nasty for a few days, use that time to clean out..then let the house air out during the lovely fresh-aired days following. turn off the HVAC unit and open everything you can open. This is a good idea to do twice a year (spring and fall) anyway.; ,, An example of a Universalist prayer: "May the blending the elements of pure salt to preserve the sanctity and pure water cleanse this space, in the Name of ........." (here add your own prayer or finish the invocation to whichever deity you have belief in). Do this in a sacred and meaningful way, in the knowledge that you are creating a powerful medicine to cleanse and heal your home.  Make sure that everywhere has been treated.  As you do so be sure to recite the names of all who live in the house and all those whom you wish to pass freely in and out, including all pets that need to go in and out. This allows them to move with ease across the boundaries that you are setting up.  Leave both to burn out to the end. 

before starting the spiritual cleansing process, there are several important steps that must not be skipped:  thoroughly clean out the junk and unnecessary items from your house (physically).  gather the things you'll need.  ,  gently pour the water into the salt, adding a prayer or invocation.  take the water and either using your fingers or a little brush, sprinkle the holy water around the walls of every room every door and every window.  pour the remaining salt/water mixture in a line in front of any doors leading in and out of the building.  go back into the house, and in each room light a small white candle and some incense.  put a bunch of fresh flowers into the main room of the house.  

 They can be metal or plastic. Some items may need a primer for real color to stick. You may have to use several coats of paint.; , Any number of weird or normal things can be found that would make a cool stencil. Choose something with a unique spacing or design. Even a toy railroad track or ping pong net might work. Or create your own out of cardboard or thick paper. If you want to make your own stencils, the best material to use is transparent overhead sheets because they are sturdy and reusable.  Pick colors you have around for a cheap redo of tins. Or if you want, buy something fresh for the job in the color scheme you want. Do not mix and match faux crackle paints with regular because they are not made to mix with other paints. They may refuse to dry and ruin your work when sprayed over or put under other paints. You will have enough variety without them, just using the stencils and your creative hand.  You may have to think backwards as you plan, so that the color you want in the design shape is laid down first. Make sure you cover any pre-printed writing on the can at this stage because you don't want to have to come back and retouch after your never-to-be-repeated-exactly stencil spraying has occurred.  This will affect your overall theme for the tin when completed. And sometimes it's hard to remember what color was used on the bottom if you do multiple items over multiple drying days. Don't be afraid of trying a new color or pattern. Just consider it all experimentation and have fun.  Have a light touch with the spray paint. Spritz in short blasts till you know how your paint adheres. Some paints go on wet and sloppy and need lots of level drying time. But don't worry if they run or bleed into a mess. Just go right over it with another color and call it your own special design. This is where you might need cheap gloves to prevent your stencil-holding hand from being sprayed.   Multiple stencils can be used on an item. If sprayed wet (before first coat has dried), do less spraying with the second color. Spraying when still wet creates a different effect as the colors swirl and affect each other. Of course, items sprayed can be left to totally dry between coats. 

find suitable objects.  find stencils with which to work.  choose your spray paints.  coat a solid cover of paint as the base.  consider whether you will spray one side or two sides at a time.  hold the stencil as close as you can to the item.  decorate with stickers if desired.  

 Pinking shears aren't an essential tool in the sewing basket but they are a nice one to have. Besides creating non-fray edges for both stored and used fabrics, and seamed edges for sewn items, they make great edgings for easy jam jar lid covers and other crafty items, as well as making cute edges to craft projects that benefit from a naive art touch, such as small cushions and sachets. On the downside, a good pair will cost at least U$20.00, so if they are something you won't use all that often, so weigh up whether you want to own or a pair or whether you can borrow those of a friend or neighbor.; , There are a lot of these available but they're absolutely no good for fabric because they're only made to cut paper. By all means have some for your paper-craft but don't mix them up.  Things to look for include:   Quality manufacture Trustworthy brand name  Stainless steel blades; lower blade extends for better control Molded handles fit neatly and are strong (usually plastic; check it's quality plastic)  Ambidextrous (either left or right hand); if not, be sure they are the correct hand for your needs Ability to try them in the store to see how they handle and feel.  Pinking shears come in lighter and heavier weights. The need will be dictated by the type of fabric you're cutting but lightweight are probably easiest for most people to work with.  Oil them periodically and have their edges professionally sharpened to ensure that they stay in the best condition.   You'll know that pinking shears are due for a sharpening when they stop cutting the fabric sharply but start either not cutting or are destroying the fabric.  

consider whether you need them first.  take care not to confuse pinking shears with scalloped edged scissors used for paper-craft.  look in a dressmaker's supply store for pinking shears.  select a good weight for the pinking shears.  take care of your pinking shears. 

 For a quick, basic style, take the hair near your face on both sides, one in each hand. Bring this hair all the way to the back of your head.  Lift your hair slightly to increase volume, and secure with the jaw clip. The handle of the jaw clip should point directly away from your head.        

pull your hair back.  lift and secure. 

 Although barcodes are designed to be "read" by scanners and interpreted by computers, it is possible with practice to look at a UPC barcode and translate it into a 12-digit number. This is rarely useful, especially since the 12 digits are usually printed beneath the bars, but you could learn it as a neat trick to show your friends or coworkers.   Barcodes using non-UPC systems or different numbers of digits cannot be read using this method. Most barcodes on products sold in the U.S. and Canada are UPC barcodes, but be wary of compressed 6-digit UPC barcodes, which have a different, more complex encoding system.  The barcode should be divided into three sections by sets of slightly longer lines. Look at the bottom of the vertical bars: some of the lines should extend further down than the others. There should be two longer lines at the beginning, two in the middle, and two at the end. These are there to help a barcode scanning machine read the bar code, and do not get interpreted as numbers.However, they still have a purpose in this method: the bars to the left of the central longer lines get read slightly differently than the bars on the right. This is explained in detail below.  Each vertical bar (black or white) can have one of four different widths. Going from thinnest to thickest, these will be described as widths 1, 2, 3, or 4 for the rest of this method. Using a magnifying glass if necessary, try to figure out the differences in the line widths. Telling the difference between two lines of similar widths can be the hardest part of reading a bar code.   Don't confuse this for the actual numbers you're trying to find, the numbers 1 through 4 only describe the width of the bars.  Start with the bars on the left hand side, between the longer bars on the left and the longer bars in the center. Begin with the first white bar on the left hand side, and measure the thickness of each bar, black and white. Each digit in the 12-digit number you're trying to find is encoded using four bars. Write down the thickness of each bar, dividing them into four-bar groups. When you reach the extra-long center bars, you'll have six groups of four digits each.   For example, if the first white bar after the extra-long lines on the left hand side is the thinnest size, write down 1. Next, if the black bar to the right is the thickest size, write down 4. Once you've done this for four bars (black and white), leave a space before writing down the next bar. For example, once you've written down "1422," move your pen to a new line before writing down the next bar width.  Do not decode the extra-long bars in the center. Starting with the first normal-length black bar to the right of them, use the same technique. This time, each group of four bars (representing one digit) will have a black-white-black-white pattern. Stop when you have six additional groups of four digits each, and do not decode the extra-long bars on the right.  Now that you have figured out which bars (of different widths) correspond to each number, all you need is to know the code that translates these into the actual digits in the 12-digit number. Use the following instructions to do so:3211 = 0  2221 = 1  2122 = 2  1411 = 3  1132 = 4  1231 = 5  1114 = 6  1312 = 7  1213 = 8  3112 = 9  , If the numbers are printed beneath the bar code, read them to see whether you made any mistakes. You can also look up the product in the GTIN database, typing in the 12-digit barcode you found into the "GTIN" field. This should find any product from a company that was officially assigned a barcode, although sometimes companies mistakenly print their own barcodes that aren't added to the system. Still, most of the time, this database should come up with a product name that matches the item you are looking at, if you read the barcode correctly.  

understand this method.  find the three sets of longer lines.  identify the four widths of the bars.  write down the thickness of the left hand bars.  do the same for the right-hand side, but start with a black bar.  decode the bar widths into actual numbers.  check your result.

 If your cat is grinding its teeth, it most likely means that it is having some dental problems. This could be a loose or broken tooth, gum pain, ulcers, gingivitis, or a problem with its jaw.In response to the pain caused by these issues, a cat will often times grind its teeth.   Your veterinarian will ask you about your cat's symptoms and then give the cat an exam. The veterinarian may need to do some tests, such as an x-ray or a blood test, to find the cause of the pain if no cause is immediately evident. Some of these tests may require your cat to be anesthetized, which means it will be put under so that the cat is still during the x-rays.Other tests, such as blood tests, do not require this.; , If your cat's teeth pain is caused by irritated gums or periodontal disease, the first step in treating it is usually a thorough cleaning. This will eliminate all of the bacteria that is fueling the issues and will give your cat a dental fresh start.You may need to go to a veterinary dentist specialist to get this treatment. Deep cleaning a cat's teeth requires the cat to be anesthetized. As such, it will usually require a separate appointment and will take about an hour.Some groomers, pet stores, and veterinarians offer "anesthesia free" teeth cleaning. This is just a surface cleaning, is not thorough, and does not clean under the gum line, where bacteria can really take hold.  If your veterinarian is able to diagnose the dental problem that is causing your cat to grind its teeth, have it treated as soon as you can. The grinding is sign that your cat is in pain, so correcting its dental problems is the best way to alleviate that pain.If your cat is in severe pain, your veterinarian may give it a pain killer to make it feel better. This is just a temporary solution until the actual problem can be fixed. In most cases, if there is a problem with one of your cat's teeth, the veterinary dentist will remove it surgically. If the problem is in the cat's jaw alignment, includes a tumor, or includes a bone fracture, that will require a more invasive surgery to treat.  If all dental issues are ruled out, then teeth grinding may be caused by another illness. While this is rare, it is most often caused by dehydration, digestive problems, abdominal pain, or neurological issues. Your veterinarian will need to assess your cat's overall health and run tests to diagnose the problem.There are many possible causes for teeth grinding in cats. Once dental problems are ruled out, your veterinarian will probably need to start with some general blood tests. These will give the veterinarian a good place to start when looking for a non-dental cause.  In order to prevent many serious dental infections, have your cat's teeth looked at every year by a veterinarian. This will help to keep your cat's teeth in good condition and will hopefully allow you to catch any issues that are developing before they become serious and painful for the cat.During an annual exam the veterinarian will talk to you about what dental care you are giving the cat, as well as looking at the cats teeth closely. If the veterinarian decides that your cat needs a deep cleaning or x-rays, then that will be done during a follow up appointment.  If you are concerned about your cat's dental health, or your cat has a history of dental problems, it is worth your while to brush your cat's teeth daily. This is the single most important thing you can do for your cat's dental health between veterinary dental cleanings.This daily brushing removes excess food, plaque, and bacteria that can promote dental diseases, such as periodontal disease. You will need to acclimate your cat to teeth brushing. Begin by putting a small amount of cat tooth paste, which is not the same as human toothpaste, on your finger. Let your cat sniff it and lick it if it likes. Gradually transition in to rubbing the toothpaste on your cats teeth. Then, when the cat gets used to your finger in its mouth, then you can transition to a pet toothbrush. This process may take weeks, or months, to complete.  There are several brands of commercial cat food that have been proven to improve a cats dental health. This is done during chewing the food, which removes plaque and tarter from the teeth.These foods either have a design that cleans the teeth or they have a chemical ingredient that removes tartar. However, be sure to pick a food that is balanced for your cat nutritionally, in addition to fighting dental disease. Ask your veterinarian if you need advice about what specific food to feed your cat. Additionally, there is an additive for your cat's water that can be prescribed by your vet that will fight plaque and gingivitis. However, this additive can make your cat's water taste strange, so make sure your cat will drink it without fuss. 

take your cat in for a veterinary dental exam.  get your cat a professional teeth cleaning.  have dental problems treated.  rule out other causes.  get your cat an annual dental exam.  brush your cat's teeth daily.  feed a diet that promotes healthy teeth and gums.

 Organic soil is generally made up of natural decayed plant matter, black humus and sterilized manure. It usually does not contain peat, which is a nonrenewable resource. It also should not contain any pesticides or fertilizers. Because of its rich content, organic soil can be reused in gardens or containers each year.  Rather than purchase an organic soil, add necessary nutrients to your existing soil.   Test your soil. Using a shovel or garden spade, dig to a depth of about 6 inches (15.2 cm) in your soil. Place the soil in a zipper-sealed plastic bag, and bring the bag to a local agricultural laboratory, extension office or garden center for testing. The testing center will provide a report on what nutrients your soil needs to support healthy plant growth. Add organic matter to amend the soil. Use your own resources to create compost for the soil. Save decaying plant waste, leaves, grass clippings and vegetable scraps from the kitchen to create organic matter.  

purchase organic soil.  amend your existing soil. 

 That is a good way to gain a plethora of knowledge about format and style. Once you have an idea of how to format it, you're ready to begin. A good place to start would be to write what you know. Take a story from your life, or someone you know. That will help you develop your characters more.; , This will help to keep you on track. Remember that a typical play is right around 60 pages and mostly all dialogue. Don't concern yourself with thoughts too much, your entire story must be told through your characters' discussion.  So, sit with family, friends or both and do a read through. You can gain valuable feedback on what is understood and what is missed. Take that feedback and use it.  If you don't, think about attending a local open mic night. Take a scene or a good long monologue and perform it. Take business cards with you and hand them out. You can scope out local talent and get an idea of any people who would be good as certain characters. If you have a group of friends that can act, assemble a cast yourself and perform your play. There are usually exhibitions/contests where new artists and writers are featured.  

read through two or three scripts in the same genre as you intend to write.  like with any story, start with an outline.  as the writer, you will always know exactly what you are trying to say and how very funny or sad certain parts are, but this is not always the case with an audience.  submit the script to a theater if you have good contacts. 

 Looking stylish helps people to think well of your image. They'll remember you as the beautiful girl or the handsome guy standing in the corner or tearing it up on the dance floor.

 Your dog is going to be scared and confused during and after a seizure, so it is crucial to do everything that you can to help them feel less afraid. If your dog suffers from frequent seizures, you will also want to learn how to recognize the signs of a seizure so that you can prepare. Some simple steps that you can take to comfort your dog during a seizure include:Placing a cushion or pillow beneath your dog’s head. This will help to protect your dog's head during a seizure. Speaking to your dog in a low, soothing voice. Say things like, "It's okay, buddy. That's a good dog. Easy, easy, I got you." Petting your dog in a calming, gentle way. You may also consider letting your dog lay across your lap or holding them if they are a small dog.; , It is a misconception that dogs will swallow their tongues, and under no circumstances should you stick your hand or fingers into your dog's mouth when they are having a seizure. You will get bit. Do not try to put any objects into your dog’s mouth either or your dog may break a tooth or even choke., It is important to get your dog calmed down before taking any other action. Sometimes the seizure may restart if your dog is very nervous and/or tries to get up before they have recovered. Continue soothing your dog and stay close for a while after the episode.To help your dog relax, keep the room quiet. Turn off the television and TV and don’t allow more than one or two people in the room. Take other pets out of the room as well.  Try to keep track of how long the seizures last. If your phone is handy, taking a video of the event may also help the veterinarian to diagnose your dog.   If the seizure continues for longer than five minutes, get your pet to a veterinary emergency room as soon as possible. Long seizures can exhaust the respiratory muscles and this can interfere with your dog's ability to breathe. 

comfort your dog.  keep your hands out of your dog’s mouth.  soothe your dog after the seizure.  pay attention to the duration of your dog’s seizures. 

 Whereas friendships come and go, things become more complicated when it’s your family member. If it's a family member, you’ll want to make an attempt to talk about your relationship and what bothers you. This will make them aware that what they’re doing upsets you. It may be hard, you’ll both benefit from being open and honest about your problems. If he or she does something hateful toward you, it may be because something negative going on in their life and clearing it up may help., This depends on who the family member is and how meaningful their relationship is to you. If it is your parent, sibling or even a spouse, you may opt for an outsider’s opinion and attend therapy. Depending on the relationship there are a variety of ways to seek help such a family counselors, social workers, or other professionals that help relationships.  If you have a family member that is toxic, it might be best that you only interact with them during obligatory get-togethers like holidays and celebrations.   If your family member tries to see you more often, don’t be afraid to say no. You do not have to necessarily confront them about your relationship, but avoidance can help weed out the negativity from your life.  Although it can be hard to cut out a negative family member, you should not let their behavior go without comment. This will not only prevent them from changing, but more importantly it will allow the negativity to remain in your life. Tell them what they’re doing bothers you. It may not simply make the problem go away but at least you’re standing up for yourself. Make note of particular comments they made and how it made you feel so that you can give them specific examples.  No one wants to lose a relationship with a family member but if they cannot heed your warnings that they hurt you, you have to worry about yourself first. If your family member has given no indication that they’ll change you should not let yourself be bogged down by them until they can work their own problems out.   If it comes to this, don't be afraid to give them an ultimatum that let's them know their behavior is giving you no choice. That way if they persist, they'll at least know why.  

be open and communicate.  get help.  limit your interactions.  stand up for yourself.  prepare to cut them out. 

 Tight pants, shorts, or panties made from synthetic fabrics can reduce the air circulation around your vagina and cause it to sweat, which can increase your chances for odors and infection.   Wear loose panties that allow for air circulation or that are made from a natural, breathable fabric such as cotton. Wear thigh-highs, or pantyhose made with a cotton crotch to reduce the vaginal sweating caused by nylon and other synthetic fabrics.; , Wet or sweaty panties and pants can cause bacteria to multiply and increase your likelihood for getting odors and infections.   Take a shower and wear fresh, clean clothing after you have gone swimming or performed exercise.  Mild soap will help prevent your vaginal region from becoming irritated or infected due to exposure from harsh chemicals found in antibacterial or astringent soaps.   Rinse your vaginal region with fresh water after washing with soap, then dry off immediately with a clean, towel to prevent moisture build-up.  This will help keep your vaginal area dry and clean throughout the day.   Use soft, white, unscented toilet paper that does not contain dyes or other irritating chemicals. Wipe yourself from front to back after experiencing a bowel movement to prevent fecal matter from coming into contact with your vagina, which can cause a bacterial infection.  When these menstrual products become soiled and are worn for long periods of time, they can cause you to experience foul odors and increase the risk of infection.   Use menstrual products that do not contain scents or dyes, as these products contain chemicals that can be harmful to your health.  Bodily fluids and residue from condoms and other intimate products can cause infection, irritation, and odors if not removed from your vaginal region following intercourse.  A diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains such as brown rice will help prevent your body and vagina from experiencing infections or ailments.  

wear loose, breathable, bottom clothing.  remove wet, sweaty bottom clothing as soon as possible.  wash your vaginal area daily with mild soap and water.  wipe your genital area thoroughly after urination.  change tampons, sanitary napkins, and pantyliners frequently.  wash your vaginal area after sexual intercourse.  eat a balanced diet high in nutrition. 

 This method is best for dry, coarse, or tight curls. These types of hair are not well-suited to dry detangling. Dry hair will be prone to breakage, and tightly curled or coiled hair needs extra moisture to properly detangle. Water breaks down the bonds in your hair, making it weaker, more fragile, and more malleable.Condition your hair after you take out braids. If you have had your hair in braids for a while, do not comb through your hair when it’s dry. Use the wet conditioner method to detangle your hair. This will ensure that you do not yank out hair. Brushing dry, curly hair can make it frizzy and even more knotted.; , This method can work well if you have loose curls or thicker, heavier hair. You will use your fingers, a wide-mouthed comb, or a paddle brush to work through the tangles and smooth out your hair. Even if you plan to wet detangle your hair, try to dry detangle as much of your hair as you can to make the job easier.In general, hair is easier to detangle when it is dry. Dry hair is stronger, so it won't break when you pull it. If your hair is too stubborn, then you may need to coat your brush in lubricating oil or olive oil to ease the detangling process., If you are growing out your hair, you might need to experiment with different methods of detangling. If you have shorter hair, you might be able to use dry-detangling. If you have longer hair, you might need to condition while detangling. As your hair changes, check to see if you need to change your detangling method from dry to wet.  

consider detangling your hair with water and conditioner.  consider detangling your hair while it's dry.  try different methods for transitioning hair. 

 Ask yourself what preconceived ideas and thought patterns stop you from getting things done. Be completely honest with yourself about the patterns that are helpful and those that are destructive.   For example, maybe you position yourself in front of a particular window when you intend to work. You might think that the scenery inspires you, but if you find your eyes wandering away from your work and lingering on the activity you see through the window, this could actually be a negative pattern.; , Even if a habit doesn't necessarily seem bad on the surface, getting yourself in a rut can stop you from taking the steps you need to reach your goals. Mix things up and change your routine.   Even small changes can alter the way you approach the world around you. Instead of starting your morning with a cup of coffee, try a cup of tea or a sports drink. Rather than hopping on your smart phone and playing a game during your break, go for a quick walk or pick up a paperback book. As you accustom yourself to the idea of change by making small alterations to your daily routine, you gradually make it easier to introduce bigger, more significant changes to your life.  Figure out why you feel that way. After you've identified the negative emotion, press on with your plans in spite of it.   Getting rid of your negative emotions can be a daunting task, and if you wait for those feelings to be gone, you may never move forward with your life. Acknowledge your unfounded worries and fears. Accept that they exist, but also tell yourself that you aren't going to let them control how you act. As you continue to move forward, you can foster more positive feelings that can help drown out the negative ones.  Comparing yourself to other people will inevitably make you feel worse about your own accomplishments. Your self-confidence takes a hit, and you might find it more difficult to work up the nerve to pursue your present or future ambitions.   Since everyone has his or her own unique circumstances, though, it isn't fair to assume that you should be at the same place in your life as someone else is in theirs.  Perfection is a literal impossibility. You will fail and you will fall. The key is learning to accept your mistakes and move past them. Once you can accept your failings, the fear of failing will stop getting in your way.  Don't break your neck trying to appease every person in your life and stop apologizing for things that aren't your fault.   Learn to say "no" to people, especially when the requests they make are unfair. If there are problems, speak up. They probably won't fix themselves, and if you don't say something, there's no guarantee that anyone else will. Stop apologizing every time someone gets upset or inconvenienced. Apologize when you know you're at fault, but don't needlessly make yourself into the villain.  Instead of making excuses, make progress. It's far too easy to think of a reason why you can afford to postpone a task until a later date, but postponing something prevents you from achieving a goal or step that lies just beyond the task you're avoiding.  Work that seems pointless is naturally harder to get done.   If you're struggling through a task or decision, ask yourself why it is important for you to complete it. Consider what good thing might be lost if you don't see things through, or what bad thing might happen if you slack off. Identifying some reason for doing the work may make the work seem worth doing.  Think about the goal you're trying to accomplish. When the work you need to do to reach that goal gets tough or mundane, return your thoughts to the goal itself. Fixating on something you want can make it easier to take the steps needed to attain it.   If the anticipated outcome doesn't motivate or excite you, you may need to reevaluate the path you are presently on. Ask yourself if the goal is really worth pursuing. You may realize you should change the goal and not the steps you need to reach it.  Inch forward little by little. Doing so is both practical and emotionally beneficial.   For example, if your goal is to find “the one” and enter into a healthy romantic relationship, you might take a small step by asking a few trusted friends to set you up or by starting an online dating profile at a trustworthy website. Neither option requires much commitment, so if it doesn't work out, you haven't lost much.  Watch the outcome of each step you make and take notes. Regardless of whether you experience success or failure, you can use your observations to figure out what your next step should be.   Maybe your online dating profile hasn't attracted anyone good, or maybe the date your friend set you up on ended in disaster. Evaluate what went wrong. You may need to try a different website or a different friend. Alternatively, you may realize that you need to try something else in your quest for romance—like attending a local singles' group or visiting a popular hangout.  Good self-discipline is essential. When you set a goal, you need to keep it. Doing otherwise will probably make you feel worse about yourself, and that negative self-image will only drag you down.   Think about how great you feel after a productive day. Then, think about how frustrated you feel after you've spent the day slacking off. When you routinely break your own deadlines and slack off on your own goals, you start losing faith in your ability to get things done. Staying focused now will help you remain focused in the future.  Pause long enough to acknowledge each successful move you complete. Your mind may naturally fixate on your failings, but oftentimes, you will need to make a dedicated effort to acknowledge your wins.   Tallying up your successes can give your sense of self-confidence a tremendous boost. As your confidence grows, your desire to push yourself along typically grows, too.  Make sure that the music sets the right tone and actually inspires you to get things done, though.   Try a few different types of music until you find one that naturally motivates you. Start off with the same set of songs for a while. When you hear these songs, your brain will eventually come to associate them with staying focused. If the music becomes a distraction, though, you should change your selection or try working in silence again.  The sense of smell is often neglected, but odors can sway your thoughts and feelings in a very subtle way. Designate a certain scent as your motivational scent. Train yourself to associate that scent with productivity.   Pick a scent that makes you feel focused. Popular choices include cinnamon, mint, lemon, orange, and rosemary.Find candles, incense, or essential oils in that scent, and keep them stationed around your workspace or home. When you start working on things, make sure that you do so in the presence of your signature scent. Continue to do so as often as possible. Ideally, you'll eventually reach a point at which you associate that scent with productivity and focus. Once you reach that point, you can carry your scent in portable form (an unlit candle, a dab of essential oil on a handkerchief) and give it a whiff when you need to focus in an unfamiliar setting.  If you feel stiff or fatigued after working for long periods of time, get up and move around. Take a walk, perform jumping-jacks, or just stretch.   Activities that get your heart pumping are best. The increased blood flow can actually reinvigorate you, making it easier to focus as a result. Take a break even if it has to be a short one. A few minutes of physical activity are better than none.  Give yourself all the tools and supplies you need to get your work done. When you're missing something significant, you're likely to use that as an excuse to procrastinate. Staying organized will prevent those excuses from piling up, thereby allowing you to get things done more effectively.   Take a few minutes to figure out exactly what you'll need before you start working. If you'll be somewhere noisy and distracting, bring headphones and music that can drown out the noise. If you'll be working on your computer, make sure that the laptop battery is charged and bring your laptop charger just in case.  Negative people will discourage you from moving forward, even if they don't necessarily mean to do so. Positive people, on the other hand, have a “can do” attitude and may actively or inactively encourage you to push forward with your own life.   You don't need to completely cut ties with every pessimist in your life, but as a general guideline, try to make sure that your five closest companions have attitudes that lean more on the positive side.When a negative person in your life actively works at tearing you apart, the relationship between you has grown toxic. You can try to fix it, but if nothing changes, your best option might be to cut ties.  Take the time to help the people around you. In doing so, you can view various aspects of life from an objective perspective. Looking at things objectively can make it easier to find solutions to problems that you've been struggling with in your own life.   Lending a helping hand to someone else can also make you feel positive about yourself overall. When you make a difference in someone else's life, you feel important, capable, and needed.  Your life needs balance, so you do need time to relax and calm down. Don't settle for distractions you'll regret later, though. Weave meaningful activities into your life that can refresh you in a more constructive manner.   When you commit to relaxation, you need to stick with that commitment. Don't guilt yourself into working through it. When you need to unwind, do it thoroughly by taking a bubble bath, doing yoga, or meditating. Choose an activity that truly calms you down instead of one that momentarily makes you feel better. Likewise, make time for activities that involve your family and friends instead of aimlessly killing time alone.  

identify the things that hold you back.  break your habits.  notice your feelings without letting them control you.when you feel anxious, hesitant, doubtful, or unworthy, make a note of it.  stop looking at the people around you.  give up on perfection.  stop playing nice.showing kindness to other people is important, but you won't be able to please everyone.  quit procrastinating.  understand your motivation.most people need to feel some sense of purpose in the things they do.  focus on your desired outcome.  move forward in small steps.large leaps can be intimidating, and if you miscalculate, the resulting mess can create a lot of waste.  adjust your plans based on your observations.  keep the promises you make to yourself.  applaud yourself for your successes.  change your mood with background music.listen to music that motivates you.  use scent to engage your focus.  move around to chase away fatigue.  make it easy to get things done.  surround yourself with positive people.  help another person.  take a break and make it meaningful. 

 Cover the grill grate with aluminum foil and pierce the foil with a knife to create holes. Let the grill heat to a medium-high temperature.   By covering the grill grate with foil, you will be able to catch more of the clam juice that leaks out. The foil can be omitted if desired, however. If using a gas grill, preheat all the burners to a medium-high heat. If using a charcoal grill, spread a single layer of coals over the bottom of the grill. Light, and let the flames go until white ash begins to form on the top of the coals. Use oven mitts to reposition the grill rack so that it is 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) above the flames or coals.  Scatter the clams onto the grill rack in a single layer.   Do not pile the clams into the rack in multiple layers. The top layers will not receive enough heat and the bottom layers will have too much weight on them to open. If necessary, cook the clams in batches.  Cook the clams on the grill, without turning or flipping for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the clams as soon as their shells pop open.   Discard any clams that refuse to open, as these have likely gone bad and are not safe to eat. As the clams pop open, they will release clam juice. Collect this juice, if possible, to serve alongside the clams.  Pile the clams onto a serving platter and serve with clam juice, lemon wedges, and melted butter.  

prepare and preheat the grill.  arrange clams on the grill rack.  grill the clams until the shells open.  serve hot. 

 The microwave generally doesn't work quite as well as the stove for hard-boiled eggs, but with a little patience it can work in a pinch. Here, you'll want to boil the water in the microwave without the eggs first. See our guide to boiling water in the microwave safely for important information.   This bears repeating: don't heat unbeaten eggs in the microwave. Even out of the shell, a build-up of pressure in the yolk can cause them to explode, damaging your microwave., Using a towel or oven mitt, take the bowl out of the microwave. Use a slotted spoon to add the eggs one by one. Make sure each is covered completely by the water.          Don't drop the eggs directly into the water. Not only can they break when they hit the bottom, but they can also splash boiling-hot water upward.  Once all the eggs are added, cover the bowl with a lid or a plate. Let it sit — the eggs will cook in the heat of the near-boiling water. Your cooking time will vary depending on how hard you want your eggs. In general, you should expect your eggs to take slightly more time than they would on the stove. This is because they did not have a chance to cook while the water was heating up.           If you like your eggs soft-boiled, let them sit for 10 minutes or less.The yolk should still be somewhat runny.  If you like your eggs medium-boiled, let them sit for about 15 minutes.The yolk should be semi-soft and the whites should be quite firm.  If you like your eggs hard-boiled, let them sit for 20 minutes or more.The white and yolk should be completely firm without being an unappealing grey-green color.  After you've let your eggs sit, remove them from the water with a strainer or a slotted spoon. At this point, the rest of the process is the same as for eggs you've cooked on the stove. See below:          Cover the eggs with cold water or set them in an ice bath for about five minutes so that they cool. When the eggs can be comfortably held, you can crack and peel them right away or stick them in the fridge for 20-30 minutes to make this easier. Store the eggs under a moist paper towel or submerged in water in the fridge. Eat the eggs within four or five days, changing the towel or water every day.  Letting boiled eggs cook for too long will give the yolks a gray-green ring and a sulfur-like smell. There's nothing wrong with these eggs and they are perfectly safe for eating. However, if you find this unappetizing, simply reduce the amount of time you let your eggs cook for next time.   The gray-green color is formed when iron from the yolk reacts with hydrogen sulfide from the white.This reaction occurs after the rest of the egg has finished cooking. Extra heat also tends to over-coagulate the proteins in the egg. This can give rubbery whites and dry yolks.  If you don't use enough heat when cooking your eggs, you may find yourself with the opposite problem as the gray-green yolks above. Eggs that don't cook long enough may have yolks that aren't as firm as you'd like. Extremely undercooked eggs may even have whites that aren't completely set. If you notice that the first egg you peel and crack is undercooked, return the rest to hot water and allow to sit.   Undercooked eggs can pose a risk of salmonella infection. The FDA recommends cooking all eggs until the yolks are firm or using eggs that have been in-shell pasteurized.As noted above, you can spin an egg on a hard surface to test whether it is hard boiled. If it spins evenly (like a top), the egg is finished. Undercooked or uncooked eggs will wobble or spiral off to one side.  When eggs are just a day or two old, the membrane sticks to the shell, making the egg difficult to peel.The best eggs for hard-boiling are about 7-10 days old. If you have to boil very fresh eggs, try steaming them first to help separate the membrane from the shell:   Place the eggs in a metal colander and rest the colander on top of a pan. Boil an inch or so of water in the pan for about 10 minutes, turning the eggs frequently. After, boil the eggs as normal.Some people also like to add a teaspoon of baking soda to the water when boiling eggs that are very fresh. This can add a sulfuric taste to the eggs, however.  If you notice the white of the egg sticking to the shell as you peel it, roll the egg around to make lots of little cracks in the surface of the shell. Then, place the egg in a bowl of cold water and let it sit for 5-10 minutes. This often helps to loosen the shell up and separate the membrane, making it much easier to peel.  This is a common problem, especially with eggs that are very cold. If you notice that an egg has cracked, a teaspoon of vinegar in the water helps the proteins in the egg white coagulate faster, plugging the cracks in the shell.Try to be quick here — if you add the vinegar to the water as soon as you notice a crack, the egg should still boil evenly.          You may notice a little whiteness creeping out of a cracked egg. If you don't get to it with the vinegar in time, don't worry. It should still boil fine, but it may look a little funky.  

heat water to boiling in a microwave-safe bowl.  remove the bowl and carefully add the eggs.  cover the bowl and let sit.  remove the eggs and chill as normal.  if your yolks are grayish-green, cook for less time.  if your egg is too runny, cook for more time.  steam fresh eggs to make them easier to peel.  crack and soak eggs that are difficult to peel.  add vinegar if an egg cracks in the water. 

 In capture the flag, two teams hide an object ("the flag") on their territory. Usually, the territory is made by splitting a playing area in half with cones, trees, or other markers. Your team tries to take the opponents' flag and bring it back to your territory before they find yours. To defend your flag, you can tag any opponent on your territory and send them to "jail" until they are tagged by their teammate to be set free. The first team to capture the other's flag wins the round. If the game was quick you usually switch sides, re-hide the flags, and play again.   Teams are even, made up frequently of 5 people or more per team. You need a large area to play in, otherwise it is too difficult to explore the opponent's territory without immediately getting tagged.; , You need plenty or room to run around and places to hide the flag. Lots of obstructions and obstacles, allowing you to hide as you search for the opponents flag, can make the can more fun as well. Try to pick an area with a large obstruction near the center so no guards can see all the way across the field. Some great spots include:   A house with a large front and back yard, or two equally large sides. A paintball course. A large stretch of woods, especially with a stream or set of power lines in the middle.You can play a modified version of capture the flag on completely flat ground as well. To do so, you simply place the flags at the farthest possible ends of the field in plain sight. Split the field in half, then start playing. The game then becomes more about running, dodging and tagging than hiding.  You can play with any number of people, but it is best with at least 10 or 12. This way you have two even teams of 5 or 6. If possible, try and find a way to separate the teams with different color shirts, hats, or bandanas.   You can still play with an uneven number of players. Have the extra player hide the flags by themselves, for example, so neither team knows where to look. They can then "judge" the game, officiating whether or not someone was tagged. You can also make it so that the team with the "better territory" (for example, a backyard with many more hiding spots) has one less player, evening the playing field.  These just need to be two objects of similar size and shape. If you are playing at night it is best to have something light colored. Some good options include:   Bandanas. Old t-shirts. Balls and Frisbees (you may make a rule that they can be passed once found, or they have to be carried) Cones Old toys.  First and foremost, designate the center line dividing your territory. It is often easiest to use a natural line, like the edge of the house or everything even with two big, noticeable trees. Then decide how far back and to the sides you be playing. This prevents one team from hiding the flag incredibly far from the center line.   While natural lines (trees, shrubs, roads, etc.) may be easy to see, old shirts, athletic cones, and small markers like toys can make it easier for everyone to see the center line if there are no good natural dividing lines. You don't have to mark off the back and sides. As long as everyone knows not to hide the flag past the boundaries there should not be a problem.  Once the boundaries are set, each team will designate 1-2 players as "hiders" who will run off to secretly tuck the flag away. The other team members will stay together, out of sight (in the house or garage, at the center line, etc.), and make sure no one is looking where the flags are hidden. There are a few rules to flag hiding, but you can modify or skip them if you want the game to be harder:   The flag must be visible from one angle (not underneath a covering or stuffed in a mailbox). The flag cannot be tied down or wedged -- you need to be able to grab it as you run past. The flag can't be buried or raised up so that it can't be quickly snagged., Jail is where a player goes if they get tagged by an opponent. If your teammate is tagged, you can run over and tag them to "free" them again. Jails are usually picked right in the center of each team's territory, and they should both be the same distance from the center line for each team., Capture the flag is a pretty simple game -- you try and get the flag from the other team back to your side. If you get tagged you go to jail until someone on your team saves you. But there are some small rules that are best worked out before you start playing. There is no "right" way to play, so simply pick the rules that you like the most:One-handed tagging, or two-handed tagging? When a player is freed from jail do they need to run back to their side before getting re-tagged, or do they get a free walk back? Can a player save everyone in jail at once, or just one person? If you grab the flag and are tagged, do you drop the flag there or let the other team return it? Can you move your own team's flag somewhere new? How far must a player stand away from their own flag (ie. no guarding the flag so that it is impossible to pick up)? 

know the basics of capture the flag to get playing quickly.  find a large, open area to play.  find an even number of people to play with.  choose two similar objects to be flags.  mark all of the boundaries of the playing field together.  hide your team's flag secretly.  pick "jails" for each team.  talk about any "specialty" rules before starting the game. 

 Curiosity is the driving force of humanity; it pushes us to explore and push boundaries. The very best, classiest and most respected kind of human is the kind that never stops learning and exploring new ideas - being the best you can be. There are several ways to ensure you are functioning at your highest potential, and the first step is to prepare yourself to tackle them! If you want to be classy and fabulous, you must work at that reputation. It won't happen for you.; , Broadening your mind is an excellent place to start if you want to come across as a really great human being. Think of strong female leaders like Aung San Su Kyi and Margaret Thatcher - for all the controversy that (unfortunately in this day and age) inevitably surrounds women in leadership, those who do succeed and those who make a difference are sharp and intelligent. All women should take pride in their education, and there are things one can do every day to boost educational credentials.  Always use correct spelling and grammar when writing.  Try not to use slang or drop your consonants.  Look up words you don't know.  Even if it's just a quick scan of the headlines over breakfast, make sure you are keeping up on what is going on in the world. , You have a say in the running of this world, so make it your business to understand it - but don't discuss your views openly unless specifically asked. That would be inappropriate and boorish.  Remember: it always, always, always pays to put that little bit extra effort into your intellectual life, because anybody with a hint of class knows that there's nothing less impressive than a dimwit.  If you want to remain healthy and active until the day you die, and have a dignified life right until the end, it's imperative that you keep yourself running smoothly. Your health is your most precious possession - without it, everything else in your life takes a back seat. So do that 20 minute DVD workout three times a week, or join a dance or martial arts class, or a sports team, or take up marathon training (this can be truly addictive after the first couple of weeks). Look at Wonder Woman - a female powerhouse with an Amazonian body, which not only packed enough of a punch to save the universe but also looked stunning in a ballgown. Make her your idol.  One piece of advice is that you should never eat anything that doesn't have a root or a mother, and it's very true. Keeping preservatives and additives to a minimum. Instead, eat wholesome, natural foods - these are what make the body work best, because that's the kind of food it's supposed to eat. Besides, would you rather be seen snacking on wholemeal toast and a fruit smoothie, or cramming a saucy, greasy McDonald's sandwich into your mouth (and likely spilling the contents on your lap in the process)? Which do YOU think is more fabulous?  , It's sad but true that looks count. This article is not going to tell you what clothes to wear or what colour your hair should be, but there are five basic rules one can follow that make the way you look a positive influence on your reputation.   Your body and clothes should always be clean and odourless. You shouldn't expose your legs above mid-thigh, your midriff, or too much cleavage. It's basic decency. Keep it private. Your underwear should NEVER be visible when out and about. Remember that even white bras show through white tops - neutral is best. Your hair and make-up should be neat and simple. Your hair and make-up shouldn't take more than ten minutes to style.  So now you're well-informed, well-nourished and well-presented - excellent! You now have to be well-behaved to finish off the complete classy picture. We all have a friend or acquaintance who is a little 'gauche' and awkward, and in order to avoid those traits all you have to do is remain aware of yourself and your actions whilst in company. Of course, whilst home alone, nobody's watching to see if you lounge around glamorously in a satin robe or just slob about in PJs, but in company, poise is everything. The following steps are pointers regarding social behaviour for classy ladies who try to uphold a standard.  I can't repeat this enough. Imagine you are a ballerina holding a position on stage. Imagine you're having dinner with royalty. Imagine anything, as long as it keeps your shoulders firm and straight and your neck elongated. Good posture improves circulation and digestion (helpfully avoiding unladylike moments of wind at the table), as well as brightening the eyes and smoothing out your figure. Never slouch, lean or hunch. You are a lady!  , This is the most flattering pose for them and doesn't give you pins and needles.  Cut off one mouthful at a time (it's rude to take little bites off a larger piece on your fork). Naturally, close your mouth when eating. Basically avoid anything that involves exposing the contents of your mouth, overfilling your mouth, or the possibility of a spillage or mess. Also don't clink your cutlery and crockery together. When you have finished eating, put your knife and fork side by side in the centre of the plate.  for example, scratching one's nose, touching a pimple, picking at a hangnail, re-arranging one's clothing etc. Hands off if there are people around! It just makes you look awkward and socially unaware. You should seem effortless, as if you don't have to think about mundane things like that. Even if you're thinking, "Oh my God, my back is really itchy!" - do not scratch it until you're in private. The only exception is moving hair out of your eyes, but please, if this happens frequently, get a haircut!  , The biggest rule of holding a classy conversation is that people with class do not, under any circumstances, start a topic of conversation about themselves. Don't mention yourself until asked (which you will be if you ask first, as long the people you are with have basic social skills. If they do not then either slowly educate them by example, or avoid them in future). It's all right to talk about yourself if asked, just don't be the first to bring yourself up.  This is a sign of insecurity. If you find yourself wanting to ask if you hair's okay, if your clothes fit all right, if your label can be seen, what you should do with your hair - please bite your tongue unless it's your best friend. Discussing your own appearance is just not done. However, if in receipt of a compliment, you may naturally smile gratefully and give a humble thank-you before returning it pleasantly.  

strive to improve oneself.  know your stuff.  write well.  speak eloquently.  expand your vocabulary.  watch the news.  find a list of classics and get to the local library!  ,  develop a grasp on national and world politics.  develop your intellect.  stay healthy.  make sure you're putting in what you want to get out!,  looks count.  behaving yourself is the next key step.  sit up straight.  cross your legs at the ankle under you chair.  when eating, use your knife and fork rather than just the fork.  touching yourself is awkward and should be avoided in public.  another key point is conversation.  most especially, do not mention your appearance. 

 A healthy diet that includes sources of vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, omega 3 fatty acids and probiotics can help strengthen toddlers' immunity.   Limit sugar intake. Sugar and other sweeteners can actually suppress the immune system and may also lead to hyperactivity, compromising the toddler's sleep and nap schedule. Make sure to feed the toddler at least 5 2-tbsp. (29.7 ml) size servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Include fruits such as strawberries, cantaloupe, blueberries, grapefruit, oranges, guava, papaya and mango. Boost immunity with good vegetable choices including sweet potatoes, broccoli, carrots, squash, kale and spinach. These fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins and antioxidants and help increase white blood cell count and boost antibodies, as well as natural killer cells. Natural killer cells attack microbes and cancer producing cells. Add fish or fish oil to the toddler's diet. Fish is a source of omega 3 fatty acids, which increase macrophage activity. Macrophages are white cells that eat bacteria in the body. Serve cold water fish varieties such as salmon, as these provide the greatest amount of omega 3. You can feed a toddler up to 3 3-oz. (85 g) servings per week, or you can mix the oil from 1 fish oil capsule into the toddler's food per day. Serve foods containing probiotics. Probiotics are healthy bacteria found in the gut. Toddlers who eat probiotic foods like yogurt may have increased immunity to rotavirus and urinary tract infections.; , Attend well child pediatrician appointments for the toddler. Your pediatrician will have a schedule for administering each recommended vaccine at the appropriate age and frequency. Vaccines provide immunity to many serious childhood illnesses.   Make sure your toddler gets a yearly flu shot in addition to the standard vaccines.  Toddlers need 12 to 13 hours of sleep per day. Sleep is necessary for a healthy immune system. Sleep deprivation can decrease the number of natural killer cells in the body and make a person more susceptible to illness.   Schedule morning or afternoon naps into the toddler's daily routine. Discuss sleeping problems with your pediatrician if your toddler has trouble sleeping. Your pediatrician should be able to provide suggestions for resolving sleep issues.  Exercise can help increase a person's number of natural killer cells and is an important part of overall good health.   Organize family exercise time in addition to solitary play. Good activities include hiking, a biking outing with the toddler on a tricycle, and any outdoor games such as kick ball or wiffle ball.  Children who are regularly exposed to secondhand smoke are at greater risk for bronchitis, ear infections, asthma and other respiratory conditions. Small children breathe at a faster rate and inhale more of the toxins than an adult, so even limited exposure to secondhand smoke can be more harmful than for adults.   Encourage all caregivers to quit smoking or cease smoking around the toddler. Request that any visitors or family members who will not quit smoking only smoke outside, well away from the toddler.  

evaluate the toddler's diet.  keep the toddler's vaccinations up to date.  ensure the toddler gets adequate sleep.  schedule time for exercise.  reduce exposure to secondhand smoke. 

 Making dramatic changes to your diet can affect your body in big ways. Especially if you have underlying medical conditions that can prove dangerous with fasting — diabetes for example — you should always get a doctor’s approval before undergoing a fast.   Many people fast for religious reasons rather than health, detoxification, or weight loss concerns. Rest assured, though, that most religions that call for fasting, including Islam, Catholicism, and Judaism, allow exemptions for those whose health won’t allow for it.Speak with your religious leader about your doctor’s concerns. Together, you can come up with a plan to practice your spiritual devotion without putting your health at risk.; , Although the human body can survive for weeks — in one documented case, even months! — without food, it will shut down very quickly without water.Our bodies are about 60% water, and every cell in our body needs it to function properly.Without it, most people will die within three days.Fasting can take many forms, and you might allow yourself to drink water throughout your fast. But some fasts — the Islamic fast for the month of Ramadan, for example — prohibit drinking water for long stretches of time. No matter how much water you allow during the fast, it's important to prepare your body for a long stretch of nutritional deficiency by "super-hydrating" beforehand.   Drink plenty of water regularly in the days leading up to your fast. Then, drink at least two quarts of hydrating fluids before the last meal preceding your fast. Also avoid dehydrating foods with high salt and sugar contents, like fast food or salty snacks.  Coffee, soda, tea, and all those energy drinks we drink on a daily basis all contain high amounts of caffeine. Though you may not think of it this way, caffeine is considered a mood-altering substance that can result in dependence, if not outright addiction. If you drink caffeine regularly then remove it suddenly from your diet, you will likely experience withdrawal symptoms. When you're eating a normal diet, those symptoms aren't very noticeable. But even a very short fast — a day-long fast before surgery, for example — can worsen withdrawal symptoms.The common symptoms of caffeine withdrawal include headache, fatigue, anxiety, irritability, depressed mood, and trouble concentrating.To avoid these unwanted side-effects, wean yourself off caffeine products in the weeks before you begin your fast.  If you have an addiction to tobacco products, it may be even harder to give up than caffeine. However, it's even more important to abstain from tobacco use than caffeine use. Not only will tobacco hit you harder on an empty stomach — making your head spin and potentially making you feel nauseous — it poses serious health risks. Tobacco use during a fast elevates both blood pressure and pulse rate, and decreases the skin temperature in your fingers and toes.If you're having trouble finding a way to quit, even temporarily, talk to your doctor to learn more effective strategies.  The word itself — "carbo + hydrate" — essentially means "watered carbon." Unlike proteins and fats, carbohydrates bond with water, helping your body stay hydrated for longer periods of time. This is very important when you're preparing to fast! In the days and weeks leading up to your fast, eat plenty carbohydrate-rich foods to help your body hold onto its water:Multi grain breads, pastas, and cereals Starchy vegetables (potatoes, parsnips) Vegetables (romaine lettuce, broccoli, asparagus, carrots) Fruits, (tomatoes, strawberries, apples, berries, oranges, grapes, and bananas)  , You may think that you want to stuff yourself with as much food as possible in the days leading up to the fast. After all, that should help tide you over when you're hungry, right? In fact, stuffing yourself regularly before your fast will acclimate your body to large meals. You'll feel even hungrier when you stop eating. It may also help to vary your mealtimes, so your body doesn't continue to anticipate food at specific times of the day.  Many people choose to eat a large, protein-filled meal for their last meal before the fast. After days of eating small, carbohydrate-rich meals, this last meal can make you feel more satisfied for a longer period of time and ease you into the fast.   Remember to take in a lot of hydrating fluids before your final meal to help your body get through your fast.  Hunger is a full-body, primal feeling, and can take over your mind if you let it. Obsessing over your hunger is the quickest way to letting yourself break your fast. Distract yourself by keeping yourself busy whenever possible.   Distract yourself with light, pleasant activities like talking with friends or reading a good book. You can also take this time to catch up on chores and errands you otherwise put off. When you're trying to keep your mind off hunger, vacuuming the whole house might not seem so bad! If you're fasting for religious reasons, you might take this time to think about why you're going through this process. Attend religious meetings, study your scripture, and reflect on your relationship with god.  If you are doing an "intermittent fast," in which you regularly fast every few days for short periods of time, you are most likely trying to lose weight. When you exercise a carbohydrate-depleted body, it begins burning fat to fuel itself, which may be your goal. Note, though, that it will also begin burning through protein and muscle mass. Your best bet is to exercise at a low rate instead of running yourself breathless during cardio.  People on an intermittent fast only fast for short periods of time. Although they should do less cardio, they can still exercise because they'll refuel their bodies soon. However, if you're planning to fast for a few days or more, it's best not to engage in high-energy activities. They will tire you out far more than they would when you were eating regularly. If you're fasting over a long period of time, rather than intermittently, you won't be able to refuel your body for some time.  You may feel relaxed while you sleep, but your body is hard at work taking care of itself. When you're knocked out, it gives your body time to repair muscles, form memories, and regulate both growth and appetite through hormones.When you're fasting, you may find it harder to concentrate from the lack of food. Regular naps taken during the day have been shown to improve alertness, refocus the mind, and improve moods.Make sure to get at least 8 hours of sleep every night, and nap regularly throughout the day.  Those who are fasting for spiritual reasons will find this easy. You may have friends from your place of worship who are fasting at the same time and for the same reasons. But even if you're fasting for health or detoxification, try to find a friend who will fast with you to keep you company. Being around someone who's going through the same thing will keep you from feeling alone in the experience. Hold each other accountable and motivate each other to reach your goals, whatever they may be.  Don't put yourself in situations where you'll let yourself feel sorry for yourself. Even if you're around other people who are going through the fast with you, don't let the conversation turn to all the foods you miss eating. You'll obsess over it long after the conversation is over, and you may let yourself cheat when you're alone. Instead of talking about what you're missing out on, frame your conversations around the positives: what are you getting out of this? Or, talk about something completely different, like the movie you just saw or a recent event in the news.   Until your fast is over, politely decline invitations to meals with non-fasting friends. Even if it doesn't tempt you into breaking your fast, watching other people eat will be a miserable experience.  Even if you have an accountability partner who's helping you stick to your fast, you may find yourself frustrated in ways you don't want to share with others. Keeping a journal to hold your private thoughts is a great way to both vent and record your experience for later insight. You can treat it like a normal diary about day-to-day life or focus it only on fast-related topics. Either way, your fast will likely find its way into your private thoughts.   Don't censor yourself! Even if you're fasting for religious reasons, don't feel bad about questioning whether you want to finish the fast. Just writing it down will help you confront the feeling, then flush it out of your system.  No matter how hungry you are at the end of your fast, you have to fight the urge to stuff yourself at your first opportunity. When you fast, your body adjusts to make up for the lack of food by slowing down the production of enzymes that help digestion.If you gorge immediately after a fast, your body will be overwhelmed by food it can't process, leading to stomach cramping, nausea, and vomiting.As you draw closer to the end of your fast, you should put together a plan for how to ease yourself back into a regular diet.  But if you’ve been allowing only water during your fast, juice and fruits, which have high water content, are the best way to ease your body back into a normal diet. Your stomach will have shrunk in size during your fast, so you may even find that juice and fruit can satisfy your hunger at first.  Stop eating whenever your hunger is satisfied — overeating before your body is ready to handle it can lead to digestive problems. It's best to stick to foods that have a high water content at first:   Soups and broths Vegetables Raw fruits Yogurt  , First, it prevents you from wolfing down your meals. It takes your brain about 20 minutes to process the information it's getting from the stomach and realize that your stomach is full.Eating too quickly leads to overeating, which is dangerous after a fast. The second benefit of thorough chewing is that it breaks the food up into smaller bits that will be easier for your body to digest.   Chew each bite of food about 15 times. Drink one glass of water before your meal and one glass during your meal to slow down the pace of your meal. Take a small sip between every bite of food.  Probiotics are “good bacteria” that are found naturally in the mouth, intestines, and vagina.They help your body digest food efficiently, which is something you need help with after a fast. Eat foods that have live cultures of lactobacillus; common sources are yogurts, sauerkraut, and miso.You can also take probiotic supplements in capsule, tablet, or powder form to help your body digest food better.  No matter what you read about the best way to break a fast, your body will let you know what it's ready for. If, after transitioning from fruits to vegetables, your stomach starts cramping or you feel like throwing up, don't push yourself! Go back to eating fruits and drinking juices for another meal, or even another day. Let your body progress at its own pace. Eventually, you can work back up to harder-to-digest foods and larger meals without feeling any negative side effects.  

visit a doctor before beginning your fast.  hydrate well before the fast.  limit your caffeine intake.  limit your tobacco use.  eat carbohydrate-rich foods.  control your portion sizes.  eat a large meal before the fast, but don't overeat.  keep yourself busy.  lower your exercise load if you’re on an intermittent fast.depending on your reason for fasting and the nature of your fast, high-energy activities may help or hurt your cause.  avoid high-energy activities if you’re on a long-term fast.  get plenty of rest.  spend time with other people who are fasting.  avoid talking about food.  keep a fasting journal.  have a plan for breaking your fast.  drink juice and eat fruit to come off a water fast.obviously, if you’ve been on a juice fast, drinking more juice isn’t really “breaking” your fast.  ease into very small meals.rather than sitting down to a lavish feast to celebrate the end of the fast, eat snacks or small meals throughout the day.  chew food thoroughly.chewing your food well serves two purposes when you're breaking a fast.  introduce probiotics into your system.  listen to your body. 

 It's not easy breaking up. However, know that your reasons are right and that it's not you - it's him. Convince yourself you have done the right thing. Although you have completed your mission, you still may feel hurt and angry. The recovery process will depend on how much you love him, but don't worry - you will feel better one day soon.   Missing him does not change any of your issues and it is not a reason to get back together. Your bigger issues, the ones you broke up over, will still be there when the dust settles.  Once you've let go of the one you love, it's going to hurt. You'll miss him at random times, feel like you've made a mistake, and want his advice on what to do next. But you have to resist the urge to text, call, or see him. You can move on and get your life back together, but only if you commit to moving on. Resist the urge to talk to him and work on sorting through your emotions on your own. It will be difficult, but you'll be able to do it with time.You may be able to be friends one day, but that day is in the future. You need to be completely over your romantic feelings, and the only way to get there is to not see each other. Packing away photos and items that bring painful memories is a good way to start the healing process.  As painful as a breakup can be, it also comes with a sense of liberation. You no longer need to make decisions for two -- you can make them only by yourself. You'll notice you have a lot more free time all of a sudden, and events and activities that were difficult to coordinate with a partner are now easily available. Don't spend your time trying to recreate the feeling you had in a relationship -- go out and try something new. Enjoy your newfound liberation and explore the single world.Do things for you. Take the time to take care of yourself for a bit.  Having a great network of other people reminds you that, even without a boyfriend, you are not alone. Spend your time with other people you love to help heal the inevitable hole in your heart.   When you feel like calling or texting your ex-boyfriend, call your best friend instead. Let them know, briefly, that you are still kicking old habits chat out your problems. Most people are happy to help you move on, but that doesn't mean they want to hear about your ex-boyfriend all day. Avoid bringing him up, instead moving on to other topics. 

remind yourself your reasons for ending things when you miss him.  separate yourself completely for the foreseeable future.  try something new.  turn to your friends and family for support. 

 Your body generally needs more protein when you are psychologically stressed. Stress can cause the death of cells and tissues, so your body needs an increased amount of protein to repair this damage. In addition to this, tryptophan, another protein, is needed to make serotonin, which is a chemical your body releases that makes you feel happy.   Protein-rich foods include poultry, fish, meats like beef and pork, nuts, eggs, beans, peas, and soy products like tofu.The amount of protein you should eat is roughly 0.8 to 1.0 gram (0.03 to 0.04 oz) per kilogram of healthy body weight per day.  Serotonin is a chemical that acts as a neurotransmitter and is a hormone that can help you to feel relaxed. Carbohydrates prompt your brain to produce serotonin. There are two types of carbohydrates—the simple and the complex. Simple carbohydrates are digested quickly and contain refined sugars and few vitamins and minerals. Complex carbs and help you to feel full for longer, which means you will feel less inclined to snack (which many people do when they are stressed).   Sources of complex carbohydrates include whole grain breads and pasta, beans and legumes, and starchy vegetables like sweet potatoes., Stress may weaken the immune system and increases the body’s antioxidant requirement. The commonly known antioxidants are Vitamin C, E and beta carotene. These antioxidants fight free radicals that can form in your body when you are stressed.   Good sources of vitamin C are citrus fruits, kiwi, papaya, green peppers, cabbage, spinach, broccoli, kale, cantaloupe and strawberries. Vitamin E on the other hand is found mainly in germ oils of wheat, corn, cottonseed and soybean and fish oils, nuts and apricots. Beta carotene, which is a precursor of vitamin A, is present in milk, butter, egg yolk, liver, spinach, grains and yellow and orange fruits and vegetables.  Caffeine has a half life of four to six hours which means that it will take its full effect after six hours have passed. Because of this, it is important to avoid drinking caffeine after 2 PM, or else you could have a hard time falling asleep, which in turn could make you more stressed the next day. Caffeine can also take an effect on the following hormones, which in turn can make you feel stressed:   Adenosine: Caffeine can inhibit your body’s absorption of adenosine, which calms the body. While this may make you feel alert in the short run, it can cause problems with your sleep cycle later. Adrenaline: Caffeine pumps adrenaline into your system, giving you a temporary boost, but making you fatigued and depressed later. If you take more caffeine to counteract these effects, you end up spending the day in an agitated state, and might find yourself jumpy and edgy by the time night comes around. Cortisol: Caffeine can increase the body’s levels of cortisol. Cortisol is the “stress hormone”, which, as the name suggests, can make you feel very stressed. Dopamine: Caffeine increases dopamine levels in your system, acting in a way similar to amphetamines, which can make you feel good for a short period of time. However, after the caffeine wears off, you may feel “low”.  

eat more protein.  consume complex carbohydrates.  up your intake of fresh fruits and vegetables.  limit your caffeine intake.

 At work, you need to minimize external distractions. If you don't have your own office, this might be difficult. If this is a problem, try to see if there is an empty conference room where you can work, especially if you have a big project you're working on that needs to get done. If you can't, change your work space to make it more conducive to work. Move your desk to face the wall, keep clutter off of your desk, and stay away from chatty coworkers.   If it still is a problem, see if it's possible to use noise-cancelling headphones or a sound machine to drown out all the other distractions., ADHD can make large projects seem daunting and overwhelming, which often causes adults with ADHD to look for an escape route. Instead of giving in to the panic, break down your task into manageable chunks. You can break them up into units as small as necessary to make you more comfortable. If you boss or professor gives you a project that is due in a month, break it up into daily tasks that need to get done. Write down what has to happen each day and highlight them once you are done.   If daily tasks are still too daunting, try giving yourself hourly tasks instead. Write them out in the same way and do them as they come up. Once you've completed each task within the time frame, congratulate yourself and give yourself a small reward. Make sure it is brief and doesn't interfere with the task at hand, but acknowledge your good work., It may be easier to cope with projects and maintain schedules if you make yourself accountable to another person. At work, find a trusted coworker, supervisor, or mentor to help keep you on track. If you are using any other coping strategies, let them know so she can ask you about your progress. At home, ask your partner, spouse, a family member, or trusted neighbor to help.   Make sure you break down what exactly you need her to do. If necessary, give them lists of the things you are working on to make sure you have to answer to someone about them., Whether at home or at work, you need an organized area to help combat your impulsive, inattentive tendencies. Think about what you need on a daily basis in all the different areas where you work and live. Designate specific areas for the things you need, such as keys, bills, office supplies, or other things that might easily be misplaced. Try to keep them in those places as you work and go about your life.   As for the things that you use less often, find proper storage places, such as bins, closets, or drawers, for them. This will keep them close by but not in the way of the items you use every day., Either at home, at school, or at work, you have a lot of paperwork. Bills, files, or other important papers can get piled up and overwhelm you. Start a filing system in all aspects of your life. Find a system that works for you and will help you stay organized. In order to keep this system working, don't avoid opening your mail everyday. Open anything you receive and file it in its appropriate place right away.   Try to go paperless on as much as possible. That way, all of the information is stored on your electronic devices and much easier to keep up with., Adults with ADHD often forget about appointments or other important events. Put all of the most important dates, such as business meetings, doctor's appointments, or dinner dates with friends, into your day planner. Make sure you read it every day to prepare for what you have ahead of you.   If you know you won't keep up with a hand written day planner, use the calendar app in your phone. As soon as you make an appointment, automatically put the date in your phone and set a reminder for yourself. This works well for other things that must be done in a timely fashion, such as paying bills., Since many people with ADHD have trouble remembering to do certain things, it can be difficult to remember to pay your bills. In situations where it's possible, set up automatic payments for your bills. This way, they will come out every month without you having to remember to pay them.   Keep up with your finances with online banking, which is easier to handle and keep track of than paper banking., Many areas have a support group for adults with ADHD. In the sessions, you can discuss your issue's with people who understand you. They may also give you some great management ideas. Look online or ask your doctor about a local group you can join. Organizations such as Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD) have support groups all over North America.   If you can't find a support group in your area, try to start one or try online groups. 

minimize your distractions.  break down your work.  make yourself accountable.  organize your spaces.  manage your paperwork.  use a calendar or day planner.  set up automatic payments.  find a support group. 

 Having a surprise party is great, but having one in public where you won't have to spend a bunch of time afterward cleaning up? Way better for a dude. Either plan the party at a friend's house, or plan the party at a local pub or restaurant that he likes.  Again, this can't be overstated: Guys like to eat and drink. If you're going to throw a surprise party, get the dude-food in hand. Figure out what he likes best and provide those drinks and refreshments.   If your guy's a meat and potatoes kind of guy, plan a backyard barbecue. Get a friend of his who is good on the grill to make up some brats or ribs, and make sure to get enough for everyone. If your guy prefers healthy food, plan out a trip to a local spot he hasn't tried yet. Make reservations for all of his friends, buy him a full tasting menu and plan the meet-up.  It's not usually necessary to waste a bunch of time and effort in making big decorations for a guy's party. If it makes you happy, go for it. If it seems like a big drag on your time and energy, then forget about it. He may not get how much time and effort it took you to create all the elaborate decorations, anyway.  Pretend like you might have forgotten that it's his birthday, or plan a surprise party for him on a random day. You can wish him a happy birthday to avoid letting his mood sink too low, but do not give away any hints to suggest that you have a roomful of his favorite people, food and gifts waiting for him back home.   Alternatively, you can also plan a surprise party for an occasion that does not usually get a party. A promotion, for instance, is an exciting life event that is not always celebrated formally, but you can surprise him by planning a party to celebrate his accomplishment.  Demonstrating that you like your guy's friends? That's huge. Surprise your boyfriend by inviting his friends over to watch a game or to play cards with him.   Alternatively, you can ask his friends to meet you and him at a restaurant or sports event, then surprise him by waiting until you get there to reveal that you asked them along.  If your boyfriend has a strong relationship with his parents, reach out to them and include them in your plan. It'll be pretty impressive and demonstrate that you're in this relationship for the long haul.   It doesn't have to be a big party. Invite them over one evening during the week for dinner, or ask if he'd like to have dinner over there some night. It might be a relief for him that you're willing and interested.  

throw the party somewhere else.  secure the refreshments.  forget about decorations.  don't give him any hints.  get his friends in on it.  do something with his family. 

 Use a squeegee, towel or cloth to dry all tiles after they get wet. Make sure you have a bathroom fan or window that can suck the excess moisture out from the air.   If you do not do this, grout will absorb excess moisture, which will turn into mold and mildew. It will stain and breakdown the structure of the grout, causing it to crumble prematurely. In extreme cases, the water and mold can get behind the grout and into the tiles.; , Many multipurpose surface cleaners are pH neutral, so check on the bottle before you buy and use it.   A neutral cleaner means that the pH, or "potential of hydrogen" is not acidic or alkali. The potential of hydrogen is judged on a scale of 0 to 14, with 0 to 6.9 being acidic, 7 being neutral, and 7.1 to 14 being alkali. Water is also neutral, at a pH level of 7.  The frequency of deep cleaning grout depends upon the amount of traffic the bathroom gets. Deep clean every month, if it is heavily used, with 1 of the 2 methods below.   Mix 1/2 cup of powdered oxygen bleach into a gallon of water. Use a spoon to stir it until it is completely dissolved. Pour the mixture all over your dry bathroom grout. Reapply after the solution soaks into the grout, or about every 15 minutes for vertical surfaces. After 30 minutes scrub the tile and grout with a nylon brush, or a toothbrush for an extra thorough cleaning. Rinse well with warm water and dry with a towel or squeegee. The more you reapply the oxygen bleach on your tile and scrub it, the cleaner your grout will become. Wet the surface of your bathroom tile. Fill an empty salt shaker with baking soda. Sprinkle baking soda generously all over the grout. Let it sit for 10 minutes and then scrub it with a nylon brush. Rinse well with warm water and dry immediately.  Make a paste with a small amount of water and apply it directly to the affected areas. Allow it to sit for 30 minutes. Scrub the grout with a toothbrush, and then rinse and dry it.  A penetrating sealer is important for bathroom grout, because it is absorbed into the grout's pores and protects it from mold and mildew. Some of these sealers can be expensive, but it is a good idea to choose based on quality rather than price.   Allow your tiles to dry. It will take approximately 5 days for the moisture behind the tiles to evaporate. Do not use your bathroom during this time. Apply the sealer to a sponge. Wipe it over the tile and grout of the entire bathroom surface you want to protect. Leave the sealer on for the time indicated by the product's directions. Wipe the excess sealer off the surface of the tile with a damp cloth or paper towels. The directions may suggest you use a pH neutral cleanser first and then rinse off the tile with a damp cloth. Apply a second coat, if it is recommended by the product. Allow the last coat of protective grout sealer to sit overnight before you use the bathroom.  

dry your bathroom after every shower or cleaning.  clean bathroom tile and grout weekly with a ph neutral cleaner.  clean the tile and grout occasionally with a mild alkali cleaner.  remove mold or mildew with a stronger oxygen bleach mixture.  seal bathroom grout with a latex penetrating sealer after installation, and again every year. 

 Start by making a slipknot and then make a chain of six or more stitches for your foundation.Six stitches might work well if you are using a bulky or super bulky yarn. If you are using a medium worsted weight yarn, then 10 stitches might be a good width. Experiment to find the ideal width for your headband., Skip over the first stitch next to your hook and single crochet into the second stitch. Single crochet to the end of the chain. This will complete your first row. You can work your rows in a stitch other than single crochet if desired. Single crochet is a good practice stitch if this is your first headband. Some other stitches you can try include:  Popcorn stitch Shell stitch Box stitch  , When you reach the end of your first row, you will need to turn your work over to work the second row. Chain one stitch. This will be your turning chain. A turning chain provides some slack to prevent the stitches from bunching up or puckering., You will need to keep crocheting your rows in the stitch of your choice until the headband is long enough to fit snugly around your head.Check now and then when the headband starts to get close to this length.  Cut the free end of the yarn and tie it to secure it when you are finished. You can leave the tail a few inches long and then weave in the end, or trim off the excess.  When your headband is the length that you want it to be, you can attach the ends or fasten them. You can either use a darning needle and some extra yarn to sew the ends together or you can hold them together with a safety pin or broach.  Another option is to leave a longer tail and use this to attach the ends. Thread the yarn through a darning needle or large eye tapestry needle and sew the ends together. Then, tie the end to the seam to secure it and trim off the excess.  

chain your foundation stitches.  skip a stitch and single crochet.  turn and chain one.  keep crocheting.  attach the ends or use something to fasten them. 

 Your first line of defense is simply removing all dangerous items from the area your dog has access to. To this end, high shelves and locked cabinets are your friend. You may want to install childproof latches on a few cabinets for extra security.Items to move include:   Medication Make-up Children’s toys Cleaning products and chemicals of any kind Plastic bags Food waste; , Dogs are driven by their noses, and they are naturally drawn to explore trash. When dogs get into the trash, it isn’t just messy, but potentially dangerous. Take steps to insure that your dogs cannot access trash in your kitchen or bathrooms.Use trashcans with tight-fitting lids in both your kitchen and bathroom. Select heavier trash bins that your dog cannot knock over. Place trashcans inside of cabinets, and secure these cabinets with childproof latches.  Food can also present a hazard for your dog. Coffee, onions, and chocolate can make your dog ill, and wrappers, peels, or other food items may present a choking hazard. Try to ensure that all food items and packaging are placed in areas your dog cannot reach. This also includes your dog’s food and any other pet food in your home.Secure food inside your pantry, refrigerator, or cabinets. Ensure that these are kept closed. Use hanging baskets for fruits and vegetables. Keep snacks and packaged foods off of counters. Secure your dog’s food in a dog-proof container (such as a dog food vault). If your dog is choking, try to dislodge the object and call your vet. If your dog ingests a poisonous food item, contact your vet or call the ASPCA poison hotline at 1-888-426-4435.  Keeping your dog confined to certain areas of your home at certain times—such as during meal times, when you are using art supplies, or when you are cleaning—can help keep your dog safe. Consider installing gates in areas where you’d like to keep your dog in (or out).Gates can be purchased at big box stores, pet stores, or online. Most gates will be approximately waist-high, which will work for most dogs. If you have an especially large dog, you may want to seek a specialty gate (available at most pet stores). Avoid keeping your dog confined for more than a few hours.  Curious dogs will investigate open cabinets, and this can present hazards for your dog. It is crucial to get into the habit of keeping all cabinets and cupboards closed. Additionally, many dogs can open kitchen and bathroom cabinets. You may want to install childproof latches on your cabinets to keep your dog out, particularly if a cabinet contains something dangerous.It is also important to keep appliances—such as your dryer or dishwasher—closed at all times. Before you exit a room, perform a safety check. Ensure that all cabinets, etc. are closed and that all hazards are out of reach.  

use high shelves and locked cabinets.  secure trash.  place food out of reach.  install gates.  keep cabinets closed and locked. 

 Know that there are also requirements for constructing the Museum Shop.  Become the mayor of the town for at least a week. Ensure the museum has at least 20 items, with one in each category.

 It's not realistic to completely avoid indulging during the holidays. The holidays are a special time and you deserve to loosen up restrictions regarding food once in awhile. Instead of deciding you won't partake at all, set a series of healthy, realistic limits for yourself.Try to set daily or weekly limits. For example, you can have one or two treats a day. You could also decide on only eating a small amount of treats on certain days of the week. Set your limits before gong out. If you're going to, say, your company's Christmas party, set a reasonable limit for how much you can consume. You can agree to only have a couple of cocktails and one to two snacks that night.; , You're likely to get a lot of snacks and treats as gifts over the holidays. This can make it difficult to avoid overindulging, as you'll find yourself continually snacking throughout the day. A good way to combat this is to simply keep such items out of reach.If you have to work to get an item, this will slow you down. You'll be able to think about whether you really need that extra cookie or brownie before bed. Do something, like, stashing baked goods and other snacks in a drawer you have to stand on a chair to open. You can also pushed baked good far back into your fridge or pantry. Try freezing baked goods. You won't be able to impulsively eat them, as they need to thaw, but can enjoy them later for a party or get together.  Very few people complete avoid indulgence over the holidays. Neglecting regular exercise can make the impact of indulgence worse, but it can also encourage you to go overboard by affecting your mood.

While it's okay to skip big days, like Thanksgiving and Christmas, strive to keep up with your regular fitness in months like December and November. If you're traveling, try to make plans that will allow you to keep up with fitness goals. See if you can book a hotel with a gym. If you're staying with family, find a local gym that will grant you a guest pass.  

give yourself healthy limits.  keep snacks out of reach in your home.  plan to stay on top of physical activity. 

; , You have to choose whether you will only need black and white and you want it printed fast. If you do and you work in an office, then choose a laser printer. Do you want a scanner with it? Does it have to have a memory card reader in it and the ability to print pictures straight off your memory cards?  , You must not go over this budget. Make the amount realistic for what you want.  Modern printers have wireless functionality which may be very useful to you. Some users might need PictBridge.  You can check online for cheaper printers. Browse to eBay for second hand printers. Remember to choose your brand. You might want HP for functions or Epson for picture quality.  This is probably the most important question to answer. If you just need to occasionally print out documents such as letters, copies of Web pages from the Internet or simple spreadsheets, a low-end inkjet or laser printer is fine. If you need to do presentations or high quality photographs, you want a photo printer. If you print over 100 pages on a daily basis and don't need color, you may want to look at the faster laser printers. And, of course, if you are starting a home business and you need a combination of scanner, printer, copier, and fax machine, a multifunction printer is best.    Resolution - the number of dots a printer prints in a square inch (over 1440 dpi is good). Choose a higher end model with a higher resolution if you will be printing lots of presentation-quality text, graphics and photos. Operating Cost - Calculate the cost of replacement ink cartridges and paper, because printer users must continually purchase more ink cartridges and toner when the old ones run out or dry up. Be aware that the cost of paper, toner and ink can amount to more than the original cost of the printer within a year or so. Speed - the volume of printout (pages per minute) is essential if you are printing large numbers of documents in black and white Size of the printout - will you be printing on oversized or non-standard paper, heavy cardstock, blueprints, transparencies, etc? Then choose a printer whose paper path is no sharper than 90 degrees to allow printing on various types of media without jamming. Post-Script Fonts - most inkjet printers are not PostScript-compatible. If you need to print PostScript graphics or fonts, consider a laser printer. Photo Quality - Specialty color printers that have photo lab quality are essential if you are looking for a printer that can print high-resolution images on photo paper. Digital camera cards and Memory Sticks - does the printer need to have built-in slots for these de vices? Network enabled - will you be connecting the new printer to a home or office network? Image processing - Processing images takes a lot of power, so printers often have as much computing horsepower and memory as a PC. Some printers form the complete image in memory prior to printing it, which allows them to handle large files quickly. Ease of use - how easy is the printer setup process? Compatibility - The newer printers are all USB-compatible, which means they will work for Windows 98/2000/XP, and with Mac System 8.1 or higher. Warranty - be sure to purchase a printer that includes a manufacturer's and/or store warranty (at least 90 days).  Prices start at less than $40, with only a few business-level ink jets costing more than $700-the starting point for color lasers. And ink jets that handle tabloid-size paper start at less than $500, which is thousands less than tabloid-size lasers cost. First, you'll need to decide on the type of machine you want: a standard ink jet for reasonable photos and a low purchase price, or a photo ink jet for superior photo quality. All of the top models offer 4800-by-1200-dpi resolution, but they vary quite a bit in terms of printing speed. Specialized photo printers may not work as well on general tasks such as word processing. Even if they do, their per-page costs may be higher and their operation slower. The cost of the printer isn't the only consideration. Color ink cartridges can be expensive, offsetting the low cost of the printer. Special coated photo papers also add to the cost of color printing. Choose an inkjet printer based on the cost of replacement ink cartridges, and not on the cost of the printer. Over time ink and paper costs can exceed the cost of the printer several times over. Avoid single-cartridge printers which only come with a color cartridge that can't print true color. It is more cost effective to purchase a color inkjet with multiple color cartridges (CMYK), so they can be replaced individually.  Use a laser printer. Laser printers cost more to buy but much less to use - they are very cost effective to operate since their toner cartridges are not replaced as often. With all costs figured in, each document page printed on a typical laser printer costs from 2 cents to 5 cents; on an inkjet, the cost per page can run from 10 cents to 15 cents, depending on the model. (This does not even count the cost of photo printing, which can cost up to a dollar per page on an inkjet when you include the high cost of photo paper and the additional ink that's used in that mode.)  ,   Once you've finalized your list of requirements, check out some of the large comparison review sites, such as CNET or PC Magazine or PC World, to get an idea of what printers are currently out there in your price range. Also check the cost of printer ink cartridges, toner and paper for the different models. Finally, read all user reviews and note any comments regarding reliability, ease of use, and any hardware issues or defects. Once you've identified some potential candidates, go to Best Buy, Staples, CompUSA or any other computer superstore to see the printers in person. If you have a small workspace area, consider the printer's footprint and how it will be connected to your existing system. When you're ready to buy, consider buying from an online vendor such as Amazon.com in order to get the best possible price.  

determine your operating system and what printer manufacturers support your operating system (lexmark printers, for example, don't support linux).  first we need to know what kind of printer you want.  now you have to know how much money you want to spend.  once this is set, we can look for features which are more important and which ones you don't want.  now place everything together and choose the right printer for you.  what do you need the printer to do?,  consider the following factors and your needs.  deciding if a color inkjet printer is the best choice  ink jets are a good choice if you are looking for high quality color photo output for a reasonable price.  deciding if a laser printer is right for you  if you do a lot of document printing, don't use an inkjet printer.  after determining which printer you want, comparison shop!

 The best thing you can do for a swollen joint is to stop using it and just rest the joint.For example, if one or both of your knees are swollen, then get off of your feet. If your elbow is swollen, then stop moving it for a while.   If you have a physical job, then you may need to ask for a day off of work.; , Putting your affected joint above the level of your heart can also help to relieve pain by reducing the swelling.Try placing the joints up on pillows or use furniture to help elevate your joints.   For example, if your ankles are swollen, then you can sit in a recliner with your feet elevated.  Icing your swollen joints can also help to relieve the pain. Try holding an ice pack on the swollen joint for up to 20 minutes at a time.Make sure that you wrap the ice pack in a towel first to help prevent your skin from becoming too cold. Never place ice or an ice pack directly onto your skin. Give yourself breaks as well to ensure that your skin does not get too cold.  Taking a non-steroidal anti inflammatory medicine (NSAID) or acetaminophen can also help to bring down the swelling in your joints and relieve the pain. Try taking an ibuprofen, naproxen, or acetaminophen.Follow the dosage instructions. Do not exceed the recommended dosage.  Wearing support hose can also help to bring down swelling in your joints and this may help to reduce the pain.You can find support hose in most drug stores or in a medical supply store, but you may also consider getting a prescription for compression hose from your doctor.   You will need to wear the hose all day to get the most benefit. 

rest the joint.  elevate the joint.  use ice packs.  take an over-the-counter pain reliever.  wear support hose for swelling in your knees or ankles. 

 Life is busy and change is inevitable. However, despite all the things that you have going on in your life, remember to keep your parents a part of it. Set aside a time at least once a week to call up or drop by and see how your parents are doing.   If you live a long way away from your parents, set up a means for communicating with them regularly. Skype is great because you can see them as well as talk to them. If they feel uncomfortable with the technology, ask someone who can help to set it up for them. Once they know how, it's unlikely they'll ever go back to older, clunkier ways of communicating.; , Keep up to date with their day-to-day happenings by asking them what they're doing. Also listen for the things they're not telling you, such as health problems or money worries.   Ask them if there is anything they need or that you can do for them. Sometimes you won't know unless you ask them, as many parents are very careful about not wanting to burden their children.  Call them, visit them and spend time having a good laugh together. Sure, there will be tales of sadness when they lose friends and stories of their hardships but it is important to remind them of what it's like to feel happy, to laugh and to see the beauty of the world.   Share jokes and funny stories together. Remember happy things from the past. Retelling fond family memories can let them know you treasure the memories too.  Let your parents know that you are there for them and that you're happy to offer advice if wanted. However, don't foist advice onto them. They might be slower and less active than before but they're still capable of making their own decisions and it is important to respect this.  For example, if they need good financial or legal advice, help them to find a good financial planner or a lawyer. This is better than trying to offer advice on things you don't know much about. Even if you do know, it can also provide appropriate distance so that nobody feels taken advantage of.  Don't presume that your elderly parents are unable to take care of their needs unless there are clear signs that this is the case. Even then, respect that your elderly parents still care about their independence and being treated as someone who matters. Respect their dignity at all stages of the elderly years.  For example, suggesting to your 76 year old dad who is relatively fit and still working hard that he needs a rail to help him get into the bath won't go down very well; on the other hand, if he's 86 and in poor health, this may be a good thing to suggest.  There is no need to over-complicate your explanations; keep them simple and ask for confirmation regularly that your elderly parent has understood and is happy to proceed without further explanation from you. This is contextual, so judge your approach accordingly––some elderly people are sprightly and switched on right into their 100s, while others may be losing their sight, mental agility and hearing much earlier.   Speak calmly at all times. This becomes even more important if you're discussing something that is highly emotional, such as downsizing the family home, moving to a nursing home, or changing their routine, etc.  If you realize that your parents need to make a major change, such as moving to a nursing home or not replacing a lost pet, approach such future issues early in small steps. Talk to them about their plans for the future and what they hope. Ask them what they feel about living in a smaller house or living in an environment where they have less to worry about. When you get a feel for what they prefer, you can slowly broach the topic of starting to make such changes. This is a much better way than avoiding such topics until you really have no alternative and then having to make massive decisions all at once.  They have been doing things a certain way for a long time; for many people, making changes to their lifestyle, their opinions and their beliefs gets much harder as they age. Your views might differ a lot or you may even oppose their views but it's best to agree to disagree. Arguing vehemently won't change their mind and is likely to create a lot of tensions.  They have made their choices based on the things that mattered to them in the past and that still matter to them now. There will always be generation gaps but there are also similarities amid the differences. Connect with your parents on the things that both of you care about and believe in, such as family, the well-being of your children and shared interests.   Consider learning more about an interest a parent has. Use the internet to find out more on any subject and ask questions based on your research. Your parent will be thrilled that you want to find out more!  , No doubt you will still have some differences of opinion but always look for the common ground. Allay their fears that you are going to argue by simply agreeing that they may have a point and then change the subject.   Stay calm. Although there are years of emotional experiences between both of you, it is important to respond to your parents in a calm and caring way.  If you end up brushing off your parent's viewpoints and treat them like children, they will feel insulted. It is important to be kind in all your approaches to your parents and not come across as condescending towards them.  Start by simply asking them and listening to their needs. If they're too proud to say they need help or they can't think of anything, take a look around and see what might need doing. You can help out in many ways, such as:   Running errands for your parents; doing shopping, collecting medication, etc. Walking their dog. If they are finding it harder to take the dog for a walk every day, help out on a few days to give them a break. Reading for them or fixing the settings on their computer so that they find it easier to see the text and use the computer.  

stay in touch with your parents.  ask your parents how things are.  bring happiness into your parent's life.  be willing to listen more than advise.  be prepared to find suitable advisers that your parents might need.  think about how important it is to feel in control.  be very careful about suggesting that your parents are older than they are.  be clear when explaining anything to your parents.  approach difficult issues slowly and with lots of love.  be understanding of the things your parents care about.  have trust in your parents.  try to move beyond differences of opinion.  avoid being patronizing.  find out what your elderly parents need done. 

 Simply take a piece of paper and a pen and write out the entire speech. If the speech is relatively short, consider writing it out multiple times. Many people memorize information better when they are actively recording it. Copying the speech on another piece of paper can help to commit that information to memory., Much like writing the speech out on paper, typing the speech can also help commit the information to memory through visual learning. Since typing is generally faster than handwriting, you may have more time to type the speech several times in one night.There is no need to print the typed speech each time that you type it. However, you may be more likely to remember things that are handwritten rather than typed., Sometimes you may think that you know your speech well, but you freeze up when you perform it in front of people. It is important to practice the speech in front of someone to ensure that you really know the information. Request that your friend give you some tips. They may be able to tell you if you are not speaking loud enough or if you are talking too quickly., If you don’t have anyone to practice with, try recording yourself while you rehearse your speech. Video recording is the best because you will be able to watch the recording and critique your speech and body language. You can also listen to the recording while you are doing other things to help remember the information., Normally, it is not necessary to recite a speech word for word. It is more important to remember all of the topics that you need to cover during the speech. Spend time memorizing the bullet points, important facts and statistics, and the layout of your speech in order to guarantee that you cover all of the information that needs to be covered. 

write out the entire speech.  type up the speech.  rehearse your speech for a friend.  record yourself rehearsing the speech.  avoid trying to memorize the speech word for word. 

 Often anxiety begins when a person is engaging in cognitive distortions, or distorted and unhelpful ways of thinking. Distorted thoughts are thinking errors that start in your subconscious mind and make you feel anxious. Once you realize that you are engaging in a thinking error, then it’s much easier to change your thinking pattern. Here are four unhelpful thinking errors that often make anxiety worse:Fortune telling is when you try to predict the future without any real evidence to support your prediction. Typically you’re assuming the worst. For example, you may think, “I know that everyone is going to laugh at me.” When you find yourself doing this, ask yourself for the evidence. Personalizing is when you believe, without any evidence, that people are negatively focused on you. For example, if you see someone talking to another person while looking in your direction, you may assume, “That person is talking about my outfit.” Mind reading is when you assume that you know what other people are thinking. For example, you may think, “She thinks I’m stupid” when you have no idea what she is really thinking. Catastrophizing is basically when you blow things out of proportion or “make a mountain out of a molehill.” You turn everything into a catastrophe when you use this thinking pattern. For example, if your friend forgets to compliment you on your performance, you might automatically think, “Oh my goodness. I did awful. Everyone probably thinks I’m completely incompetent.”; , When you think that you may be engaging in cognitive distortions, take a minute to determine if your thoughts are real or distorted. You can do this by asking yourself for the evidence. Say to yourself, "What real evidence do I have that supports this thought?" When you take this approach, it helps you identify the thinking error and allows you to think more helpful and realistic thoughts. Here are examples of asking for the evidence based on the cognitive distortions above:   "What actual evidence do I have that everyone will laugh at me during my presentation?" "How do I know that she is really talking about my outfit and not about something else?" "What actual evidence do I have that she really thinks I'm stupid?" "What evidence do I have that the audience thought that I was incompetent?"  , Negative automatic thoughts are usually at the foundation of your anxiety.They are quick flashes of thought that enter your consciousness without you really being aware of them. Unfortunately they have often been reinforced since early childhood so you no longer even realize that they are present. They also usually contribute to your thinking errors.   For example, if every time you stood up in class in elementary school to speak, a peer laughed at you, you may have internalized that people laugh at you when you speak. Your automatic thought as an adult might now be, “If I speak in public, I will be embarrassed because people will laugh at me.” When you find yourself feeling anxious, reflect on your thoughts. Ask yourself, “Why am I feeling anxious?” Take note of your response and then dig deeper by asking yourself, “What else?” For example, if you ask yourself why you are feeling anxious, you may think, “I don’t want to speak in public.” If you dig a little deeper by asking, “What else?” you may discover that the real negative thought is “I’m afraid people will laugh at me.”  , Once you understand the negative thoughts that are causing you to feel anxious, now it’s time to replace them with more helpful thoughts. Ask yourself questions that will help you identify a healthier opposite thought.Using the same example from above about public speaking, here are some questions that you could ask yourself:   Do people ALWAYS laugh at me when I speak? When was the last time someone laughed at me when I said something? Even if someone does laugh, is that the end of the world? A healthier alternative thought could be “I am going to speak to the best of my ability. The people who need the information will hear it, even if the delivery is not perfect. It doesn't have to be perfect in order for me to do a good job.”  , Try to avoid listening to your internal chatter by focusing on the external world. Observe what people are doing and saying. Try to really tune into conversations so that you aren’t preoccupied with your thoughts or uneasy bodily sensations. 

assess the cognitive distortion.  ask yourself for the evidence.  identify your negative automatic thoughts.  challenge and replace the negative thought.  focus on your surroundings.

 The size of a first aid kit depends on how it is being used, and how many people will use it. In general, if your fist aid is coming with you on a camping excursion it should be big enough to stock adequate supplies for everyone in attendance but also lightweight and portable.If you're backpacking alone or with one or two other people, keep it on the smaller side as the less items in your backpack the better. Added weight can cause back strain and fatigue that can interfere with your journey. If you're camping with a big group, family sized first aid kits are available online and at camping and department stores. If you're using an RV or a car camper, you should consider investing in a car emergency kit, sold online or in camping stores, that includes car essentials like cable ties, bungee cords, and spark plugs in the event of an automobile emergency.; , First aid kits come in all shapes and sizes, and are built from a variety of materials. While some people use their backpacks/totebags or cardboard boxes as first-aid kits, for camping you will need a waterproof container that seals shut. Go for materials like plastic, metal, and tin. Remember, size matters. Base what you use as a container on the number of fellow travelers and the length of your trip. If you're comfortable crafting a kit yourself, possible containers include:   Lunch boxes, food tins, tackle boxes, and other food storage containers, reusable or disposable. Very helpful are First Aid boxes from Stock of the Army Medical Corps. Newer versions are plastic-made and have a tightening gasket plus the Red Cross badge outside. A zipper top clear plastic bag. Clean plastic food containers., If you're not into DIY creations, purchase a first aid kit. Costs vary depending on size, whether the kit is stocked, and its material.   You can find first aid kits as many mass merchandise retailers, such as drug stores, grocery stores, discount stores, and convenience stores. Speciality retailers, such as outdoor and camping stores, can provide first aid kits that are camping specific. The employees should also be able to answer any questions you have, so this would be a great option if you're new to camping. First-aid kits are available online. However, you should avoid purchasing a first-aid kit online if you're unfamiliar with camping and do not know exactly what you're looking for., You need to be prepared for accidents while camping, and having supplies ready in the event of a wound or a burn is important. Get these items together for your kit:   Bandages, in assorted sizes and shapes. Make sure to include butterfly bandages, which will hold the edge of a deep cut together, and triangular bandages to create slings or hold dressings. Blister pads Gauze pads Elastic bandages for wrapping sprains Moleskin Q-tips Antiseptic wipes Antibiotic cream , e.g. PVP Iodine solution and / or ointment. Burn ointment Rubbing alcohol, to clean tools such as tweezers in the event they are needed for an injury Hydrogen Peroxide about 3 % as solution. Some plastic vials with sterile NaCl 0,9% solution may be very helpful to rinse dirt away from the eyes or for cleaning a dirty wound as 1st step care.  While on the trail, anything you need for your personal medical care should be packed in a first aid kit.Any prescription medications you or your fellow travelers use. Over-the-counter pain management medication, like aspirin and ibuprofen. Gastrointestinal meds, such as antacids and anti-diarrheal medication. Antihistamines in the event of allergic reactions, e.g. Hydrocortisone Cream as OTC. Topical antibiotic cream to treat small, shallow wounds.  While camping, you will need a variety of tools to get through snares and wounds on the trail. In your fist aid kid, you should store:   Tweezers Scissors Magnifying glass Safety pins Duct tape Needle with thread, in the event repairs are needed Medical gloves, which are needed for handling unsanitary materials Waterproof matches and fire starter Water purification tablets, in the event you run out of water and need to use stream or lake water Small-edge razor blade Fingernail clippers Flashlight A variety of batteries Emergency blanket, which is an aluminum style reflective blanket to have on hand if temperatures drop dangerously low or if you get wet, Depending on weather and other conditions, you may need some of the following creams and sprays on your trip:.   Anti-itch creams or sprays, particularly those that help relieve itching and pain from bug bites and contact with poisonous plants Burn relief sprays Petroleum jelly for chafing Lip balm Sunscreen  , These additions are optional, and depend whether you need them for your personal care.:   Epi-pen, if you suffer from severe allergic reactions. Multivitamins, if you have a special diet plan. Snake-bite kit if you're hiking in an area where snakes are present. Dog boots, if you're hiking with a dog. These can protect their feet on harsh terrain. Baby wipes, if you have a small child. Anti-chafing of ant-friction cream, if you're hiking in humid environments.  Depending on what the weather will be during your camping trip, special supplies might be needed. Make sure to check the forecast before setting out.   If you're camping in hot or humid conditions, bring waterproof sunscreen and lip balm that is at least SPF 15, coolers for drinks and food, and clothing made from light fabrics like nylon and polyester.If you're camping somewhere cold, bring chapstick and moisturizer as winter can lead to dry, irritated skin., Group items together based on their usability. That is, keep your medical supplies in one section, your burn wound and care supplies in another, and so on. If you bought your first aid kit online or from a retailer, they should have separate sections built in. If not, you can glue in cardboard or plastic as a barrier or keep items in small plastic bags together. Organization is important as, in the event of an emergency, you should be able to locate needed items fast.  Some times in your first aid kit need to be sealed in plastic bags before being stored. Make sure you know what to bag.   Anything with a strong scent, like lotion and some antifungal creams, should be bagged to mask the smell and deter predators. If you're camping at a faraway location and taking your first aid kit on a plane, you'll need travel sized versions of liquids, gels, and creams. For carry-on, all liquids must be in containers of 3.4 ounces or less and these bottles must all be placed together in a ziplock plastic bag. This bag can be no more than one quart in size., The night before you leave for your camping trip, make sure all items in the fist aid kit are stores and ready. Make sure medications are not expired, batteries are in working order, tweezers and other tools are sharp and ready. 

make a decision about size.  decide what to use as the container.  know where to purchase a first aid kid.  collect wound and burn care.  gather medical essentials.  include tools.  take a variety of sprays and creams.  pack any miscellaneous items specific to your circumstances.  consider weather conditions.  organize your supplies.  figure out what needs to go in a plastic bag.  give your kit a check up before you leave. 

 Press and hold Ctrl + Shift then hit Esc. This should open Task Manager. At the top, there should be seven different tabs. , The name of each program should be on the far right-hand side of the box below, labeled “Name.” The next row over to the right should be “Publisher.” These are important because before you disable a program, you need to know what it does for your computer. For example, it is not a good idea to disable your anti-virus, which usually starts with the computer. Here are the basic rules to go by:    Look at the Publisher: If you are looking down the Publisher row and you see “Unknown,” it might indicate the program is suspicious. Any program that is worth its salt, and is safe, will show its name there (e.g., Apple Inc., Piriform Ltd, Google Inc. etc.).  Search online: If you are not sure about a company name or program name, and you would like to see what it does or other details regarding the program, search online. On Windows 8, there is a little bit more flexibility here. Right-click on any program name and select “Search online” from the drop-down list. This will open a Google search for that program automatically. Look through the different results until you are sure what you are dealing with.  Review the Startup Impact: On the far right of the startup list, near the top, there should be an option that says “Startup impact.” Basically, there are 3 different levels of impact: low, medium, and high. The higher the impact a program has, the more time the PC will take to boot. This is just another way of deciding which startup items to remove.  Right-clicking the item you want to remove should open a drop-down menu. If the item you right-click is currently enabled, the top result on the menu should be disable; vice versa for disabled items. Click “Disable” on this menu to disable the startup program.   When a program is enabled, it should move to the top of the startup program list. The disabled items should be under them. After you are done, simply close the Task Manager and your changes will become effective when you restart the PC.  

open the task manager.  click “startup.” the contents of the tab will list all the programs that currently start running when the computer boots up.  ,  review the programs.  disable startup items. 

 All the symptoms of type 1 diabetes are a result of hyperglycemia, or high glucose in the body, and the body working to balance it out. Increased thirst (polydipsia) is one of the most common symptoms. Extreme thirst occurs as a result of the body trying to flush out all of the glucose in the blood stream since it can't be of use (because there is no insulin to escort it into the cells). Your child may feel thirsty all the time, or may drink unusually large amounts of water that are far beyond their normal daily fluid intake. According to standard guidelines, children should drink between five to eight glasses of fluids per day. Young children (ages 5 – 8) should drink less (about five glasses), and older children should drink more (eight glasses).However, these are ideal guidelines, and only you can know how much water and other liquids your child actually intakes on a daily base. Thus, the assessment of increased thirst is relative to what your child usually consumes. If they usually drink just about three glasses of water and a glass of milk with dinner, but now constantly ask for water and other drinks and are drinking a lot more than their usual three to four glasses a day, this may be cause for concern. Your child may feel a thirst that cannot be quenched even if they intake a lot of water. They may even still appear dehydrated.; , Increased frequency of urination, also known as polyuria, is the body's attempt to filter out the glucose with urination. Of course, it is also a result of increased thirst. As your child drinks more water, the body will produce more urine, resulting in considerably higher incidences of urination.Be especially vigilant about the nighttime and check to see if your child is urinating more than usual in the middle of the night.There is not an average number of times that children urinate a day; this depends on their food and water intake and so what is normal for one child will not necessarily be normal for another. However, you can compare your child's current frequency of urination relative to his past frequency. If in general, your child went to the bathroom about seven times a day, but is now going 12 times a day, this is cause for concern. This is also why the nighttime is a good time for observation or awareness. If your child never got up in the middle of the night to pee, but is now up two, three or four times a night, you should take them to the doctor for testing. Also look for signs that your child is dehydrated from urinating so much. The child may have sunken eyes, a dry mouth, and a loss of elasticity in the skin (try lifting the skin on the back of the hand upwards in a tent shape. If it doesn't bounce back immediately, this is a sign of dehydration).You should also pay close attention if your child starts wetting the bed again. This is particularly important if your child has already been potty trained and has not wet the bed for a long time.  Juvenile diabetes commonly causes weight loss due to metabolic derangements linked to increased blood sugar levels. Very often the weight loss is rapid, although at times it may progress gradually.Your child could be losing weight and may even appear emaciated or skinny and weak due to juvenile diabetes. Note that a loss of muscle bulk also often accompanies the weight loss due to type 1 diabetes.As a general rule, unintentional weight loss almost always warrants consultation with a medical professional.  The resultant muscle and fat breakdown, along with calorie loss, stemming from type 1 diabetes further leads to loss of energy and subsequent increased hunger. Thus, there is a paradox here — your child could be losing weight even as they demonstrate a noticeable increase in appetite.Polyphagia, or extreme hunger, results when the body attempts to get the glucose that its cells need from the blood. Your child's body wants more food to try to get that glucose for energy, but it cannot. Without insulin, it doesn't matter how your child eats; the glucose from the food will float around their bloodstream and never make it into the cells. Note that there is no medical or scientific benchmark to assess your child's hunger. Some children naturally eat more than others. Keep in mind that children tend to be hungrier when they experience a growth spurt. Your best bet is to measure your child's behavior with their previous behavior to assess whether they seem considerably more hungry than usual. For example, if your child would usually pick at their three meals a day but for a few weeks has been eating everything on their plate and even asking for more, this may be a warning sign. If this is accompanied by increased thirst and trips to the bathroom, it is less likely to just be a sign of a growth spurt.  The loss of calories and glucose required for energy production, as well as fat and muscle breakdown, will generally result in tiredness and a disinterest in normally beloved games and activities.Sometimes children also tend to become irritable and have mood swings as a result of the exhaustion. As with the other symptoms mentioned above, you will need to assess your child's sleeping patterns based on what is normal for them. If they usually sleep seven hours a night but is now sleeping 10 hours and still complains of being tired or shows signs of being sleepy, slow, or lethargic even after a full night's sleep, you should take note. This may be a sign that they are not just experiencing a growth spurt or a period of tiredness, but that diabetes may be at work.  High blood sugar levels change the water content of the optical lens and cause the lens to swell, leading to hazy, cloudy, or blurred vision. If your child complains of blurry eyesight, and repeated visits to the ophthalmologist have been of no use, consult a doctor to rule out Type-1 diabetes.Blurry vision usually resolves with the stabilization of blood sugars.  

keep track of your child’s thirst.  notice if your child urinates more frequently than normal.  pay attention to any unexplained weight loss.  note if your child suddenly has an increase in hunger.  notice if your child suddenly seems fatigued all the time.  take note if your child complains of blurry vision.

 It it not wise to keep prepared foods for long periods of time as this gives bacteria the opportunity and time to multiply.; , Foods should not be partly cooked or raw. It is safer to eat foods that are cooked fully, as exposure to high temperatures for longer periods will kill off any viable bacteria present in the foods.  Vitamin C can be found in fresh fruit such as oranges, lemons, or any other available fruit or vegetable.  If there is any evidence that the water may be contaminated, always boil before use. Contaminated water may contain harmful bacteria such as Salmonella and Shigella, and for an immune-compromised person, this may result in a life-threatening disease.  Most of the nutrients and nourishment in these types of food has already been destroyed through the artificial processing.  Untreated milk may contain bacteria such as Brucella, which can kill a healthy human being. Cheese containing molds or that show evidence of aging, should be avoided at all costs. This may contain fungal elements that will take over your immune system and make you sick.  Ask your health professional for advice as to what to take.  Remember that dust particles will have natural airborne spores, causing illness to a person whose immunity is compromised.  If you have any doubt regarding the types of food or food products to be eaten, seek advice.  So long as you take care and adequate precautions to eat defensively, you should be able to eat without concern.  

if possible, prepare small quantities of food and consume immediately.  eat properly cooked foods.  increase the intake of vitamin c. vitamin c increases immunity and optimal functioning of the immune system.  ensure that all fruit and vegetables are washed in clean water.  avoid canned and processed foods.  do not drink milk or any milk product that has not been pasteurized or boiled.  supplement your diet with vitamins and minerals to fight off infection.  always wash your hands thoroughly and make sure that eating utensils are free of dust.  be sure to obtain further information from your local clinic or hospital.  most importantly, languish and enjoy your meals, without worrying unnecessarily about sickness and health issues. 

 People have different ways of learning that make the information easier to understand and retain. Some people find visual aids are the most useful, while others need to hear the content of the learning before it makes complete sense. Others again need to be moving about, touching and making things in order to be able to learn. Once you have worked out which style best suits your learning, you can put it to good use in developing key ways of studying that work for you. There are generally 4 types of learners:   Visual learners: these are people who prefer to see some sort of illustration to further explain a subject. Auditory learners: these are people who rely on hearing and speaking to understand information and instructions. They may struggle with understanding written instructions. Kinesthetic learners: these are the "do-ers". They prefer completing hands-on activities and experiments to understand what they are learning. These people excel in science related subjects because of the hands-on atmosphere they present. Reading or writing-preference learners: these, as the name suggests, prefer reading or writing the information repeatedly to understand it.; , If you are a visual learner, watch educational videos about the subject instead of reading the textbook. You may also use graphic organizers and other illustrations to understand a specific topic.   Visual may make charts, flow maps and make information visual.  If you are an auditory learner, try purchasing an audio version of the textbook being used, or simply read it aloud. As opposed to writing notes, record them with a tape recorder and play them back to study.   Auditory can tape lectures, read info aloud, tape notes/textbook readings and talk to others about it.  If you are a kinesthetic learner, think of some creative activities and/or experiments to review information.   Tactile can make flap books, become the teacher, and ask on ways to make your info hands on.  If you are a reading or writing-preference learner, all you have to do is read whatever information you are required to know. It might also help to paraphrase the information and write it down, just so you're sure you understand it.  Even if you decide that you are definitely a certain style of learner, try learning techniques from other styles of learners. Apply these to your studying, to broaden the interest and to help round out the ways in which you learn best. It's not a good idea to be too strict about only using one style, or you risk being bored and missing out on a great tool meant for another learning style. Mix it up in ways that work best for you., Removing noise and distractions can help you to focus better and get on with the studying within a set block of time. That said, some people actually do study better with hubbub and people around, so just as with learning styles, if this latter approach better suits you, use it to your advantage and study in a cafe, a work-group space or similar less quiet zone.  If you go to a public place or a friend's house, bring all that you need with you and keep an eye on electronics in public areas.  This doesn't work for everyone but some people find that it can help to listen to music, especially classical music or instrumental music. This tends to be a "now and then" thing though––some days you may find the music soothing and helpful, while other days it's annoying and distracting. Don't treat music as an always must-have, as your use for it will vary., Study in 15 minute chunks and take 5 minute breaks. Or study for half an hour to 55 minutes, then take a break. Get into this habit and stick to it, as it's good for your body and brain both to have a stretch, a walk around and a change of scenery for a few minutes., It's easier to study with people who learn the same way you do.  The following exercise will help you to develop a quick prompt for recalling lots of text:  Start reading the text, with the aim of trying to understand it. If you don't understand anything, then pause and read again.       Pick up important and catchy words in the text. Consider these your "keywords."       Write the keywords down on paper.       Take the first letter of each word. Write down that letter on the next line of the paper.       After you get all the letters, make words out of them.       You can make a single word or a sentence too.       The trick in making these words is that you can make words which you use daily e.g, your friends name or a joke which makes you and your friends laugh,or a strict teacher etc.       By doing this, you can easily get a hold of the important words which were listed in the text.  A reward system can help you to get through large or challenging learning stages. Set goals for completing sections of learning, followed by such rewards as a night off from studying, a movie with a friend, a piece of chocolate cake, whatever. Keep the rewards realistic, affordable and small. Leave any large reward for completion of everything, tests and exams included. 

find out what your learning style is.  learn through seeing.  learn through listening.  learn through doing.  learn through reading and writing.  switch your learning styles around now and then.  choose a quiet place to study.  listen to music.  take regular breaks when studying.  create a study group of people who learn the same way you do.  make a memory prompt from your studying.  use rewards. 

 Sprinters, I would recommend using running tracks because they are better for your type of running style.; , Always tie long hair back so you can see where you are running. Get a small, light backpack in which you can carry a small towel and water bottle to prevent dehydration. , Have a bowl of cereal, a glass of juice or milk, whole grain toasted bread, a banana and apple. Don’t eat too much, but don’t eat too little; balance out meals before doing any serious exercise, and then let your food digest for half an hour to one hour at the maximum.  When you reach your final destination, do a brisk walk and drink some water; it’s important to do a brisk walk to cool you down and make sure the muscles don’t seize up.  You should eat things like:   Whole grain pasta Boiled rice Potatoes Starchy vegetables Fruits Whole meal bread Protein- 15-20% of your calorie intake should be of Protein. Runners, especially those doing long distances should consume 0.5g to 75g a day. Try to concentrate on protein that is low in fat and cholesterol such as lean meats, fish, low fat dairy products, poultry, whole grains and beans; if you are vegetarian eating nuts, tofu and greens will increase both protein and iron. Fat- A high fat diet can quickly pack on the pounds, so try to make sure that no more than 20 - 25% of your total diet comes from fats. Stick to foods low in saturated fats and cholesterol. Foods such as nuts, oils, and cold-water fish provide essential fats called omega-3s, vital for good health and can help prevent certain diseases. Most experts recommend getting about 3,000 mg of omega-3 fat a day. , Runners don't get energy from vitamins, but they are still an important part of their diet. Exercise may produce compounds called free radicals, which can damage cells. Vitamins C, E, and A are antioxidants and can neutralize free radicals. Getting your vitamins from whole foods is preferable to supplementation; there's no strong evidence that taking supplements improves either health or athletic performance.   Minerals Calcium: A calcium-rich diet is essential for runners to prevent osteoporosis and stress fractures. Good sources of calcium include low-fat dairy products, calcium-fortified juices, dark leafy vegetables, beans, and eggs. Your goal should be 1,000 to 1,300 mg of calcium per day. Iron: You need this nutrient to deliver oxygen to your cells. If you have an iron-poor diet, you'll feel weak and fatigued, especially when you run. Men should aim for 8 mg of iron a day, and women need 18 mg. Good natural sources of iron include lean meats, leafy green vegetables, nuts, shrimp, and scallops. Sodium and other electrolytes: Small amounts of sodium and other electrolytes are lost through sweat during exercise. Usually, electrolytes are replaced if you follow a balanced diet. But if you find yourself craving salty foods, it may be your body's way of telling you to get more sodium. Try drinking a sports drink or eating some pretzels after exercise.  

look on maps or search on google for local running tracks, fields or woods; it’s good to be able to get to know in which direction you’re running, where you’re starting from, the best routes and getting to the end.  invest in some good sportswear: tracksuit bottoms, tight fitting cycling shorts, and t-shirts made from breathable, light material.  it is vital to exercise and stretch before runs.stretching and doing some light jogging to warm up and relax your muscles is highly recommended to reduce the chance of pulling a muscle or straining your legs or ankles.  ,  eat a good breakfast before going for your run, something with plenty of carbohydrates, starch, iron and protein; these are important nutrients to take into your system as they slowly release energy, providing you with more strength, endurance and energy for your run.  when running always start off doing a light jog and as you get nearer to your ending, increase your speed, never use up all your energy at the start because remember you have to go back to where you started don’t you?,  think about your diet; diet is very important and vital when it comes to sport, and especially running; 60-65% of your calorie intake should be of carbohydrates; carbohydrates as i explained earlier give you slowly released energy.vitamins  ,  get your daily vitamins. 

 If you are using a towel, make sure that you do not have any fibers from the towel on the index finger you are using to insert the contact lens.   Avoid drying your hands with paper towels, as these tend to leave more fibers on your finger.; , With her head tilted slightly back, ask her to look forward and then slightly upward. Try not to hover immediately above her eyes; this might cause her to instinctively blink more. Instead, place her shoulder against your side, so she is standing next to you, as opposed to in front of you.  This will ensure that the contact lens is not inside out. Make sure that the lens you have on your finger corresponds to the correct eye. It is likely that your child may need a different prescription strength in each eye, so make sure you have selected the correct lens for each eye.   Many contact lens cases will have a label for each eye; for example, the case for the right eye's lens might read "R" on the lid.  Your child will probably need to gently pull up the skin of his upper eyelid toward his eyebrow using his index finger in order to keep his eye open for the insertion. The bottom eyelid may also need to be pulled gently down, toward the cheek.  The lens should stick to the eye almost like a suction cup once it comes in contact with it. Try to center the lens over the iris of the eye.   As you approach the eye, ask your child not to focus on the lens itself as this will increase her risk of blinking before you can properly insert it. Instead, encourage her to look just to the right of your finger, but while still looking upward. Make sure the lens is well-lubricated with solution so it is not too dry. If the lens is too dry, it might not come easily off your finger as you try to insert it.  This will help the lens adjust to the curve of the eye. He may need to blink a few additional times to fit the lens. Be sure he does not blink too rapidly because this may cause the lens to fall out. , It is important that your child learn how to insert her lenses for herself. Many optometrists will request that your child practice inserting a trial pair of contacts at their office. If your child inserts her contact lenses herself, this will also reduce her desire to blink during the application process.   A recent study found that children between the ages of eight and nine were all successfully able to insert their own contact lenses., Make sure your child knows that he should never clean his contacts with water or saliva; instead, he should only use solutions and disinfectants that have been recommended by his optometrist. He must also properly store his contact lenses in an optometrist-approved solution overnight or when not in use., If your child is wearing daily disposable contacts, make sure that she is properly disposing of the pair each evening and not wearing them over a longer period of time. You should ensure that your child is not sleeping in a pair of contact lenses unless the contacts have been approved for overnight use.  If your daughter is wearing make up, make sure she knows that she must insert her contact lenses prior to applying cosmetics. You should also look into using hypoallergenic cosmetic and skincare products for your child when she wears contact lenses.  Is your child very active? Does he participate in many sports or group activities that can be impeded by glasses? Is he worried about breaking her glasses when she is active? 36% of optometrists say that parents request contacts for their children so they can more fully participate in sports.Contacts can also help improve your child's peripheral vision when he participates in sports.  Do glasses negatively impact your child's self-esteem? Does she have poor self-image because she believes her glasses make her look weird or different? Recent studies have indicated that wearing contact lenses can significantly improve a child's self-esteem and her comfort in participating in group activities., Is your child good at following instructions and carrying out daily chores? Does he make his bed and keep his personal space tidy on a regular basis? If he is responsible and mature, then he will be a good candidate to take care of his contact lenses., Doctors will most often prescribe contact lenses for children between the ages of 10–12. These are often prescribed in conjunction with a pair of prescription glasses; at this age, contacts often serve as a secondary form of vision correction. Approximately 12% of doctors will prescribe contacts for children between the ages of eight and nine and a further 12% will prescribe contact lenses for children younger than eight years old.For children, doctors will often prescribe daily disposable contact lenses to minimize the risk of unhygienic storage and handling. Daily disposable lenses typically cost $100 more than longer wear lenses. In rare cases, optometrists will prescribe contacts for infants suffering from congenital cataracts. If your child suffers from seasonal allergies, then she might not be the best candidate for contacts as the lenses may cause additional irritation in the eyes. 

wash your hands with soap and warm water and dry them thoroughly.  position your child so she is facing you.  place the contact lens so it is curved like a bowl on the tip of your index finger.  ask your child to open his eye as wide as possible.  gently place the contact lens onto your child's open eye as your child is looking upward.  ask your child to take one slow blink.  repeat these steps for the other eye.  ,  help your child insert her lenses only on a temporary basis.  monitor your child's cleaning habits for his contacts.  watch your child's wearing habits.  discuss the proper methods of contact lens insertion with your child.  consider your child's lifestyle.  evaluate your child's self-esteem.  consider your child's habits.  discuss getting contacts for your child with your optometrist. 

 The water should be about room temperature—not too warm and not too cold. It should be deep enough for you to stick your hand into., You can use just about any type of liquid soap, including: body wash, dish soap, and hand soap. Keep stirring until the soap has completely dissolved and no streaks remain.Plan on using about 1 part soap to 10 parts water.You can also liquid glycerin. The glycerin will react with the silicone and cause it to clump together., Purchase a tube of pure silicone from the home improvement store; make sure it is not the quick-set kind. Squeeze enough of the silicone into the bowl to cover your desired item with.Construction silicone may also be labeled as silicone caulk. If your tube of silicone did not come with a syringe, you will need to purchase a caulking gun, insert the tube, cut the end off, then poke a hole in the tip., Put on a pair of plastic gloves, and reach into the water. Grab the silicone with your fist and squish it together. Knead it until it is no longer sticky while keeping it under the water. This will take about 5 minutes., Begin by rolling the putty into a ball between your palms. Press it against a flat surface, and lightly push down on it. It still needs to be thicker than the item you will be molding.If the silicone is sticky, coat your hands and work surface with a thin layer of your liquid soap., Make sure that you are pressing the item with the design side face-down into the putty. Gently press the edges of the mold against the item so that no gaps remain., Silicone will never turn rock-solid; it will always remain flexible. Simply wait a few hours for the silicone to turn rigid enough so that you can still flex it, but no longer dent it., Take the mold by the edges, and bend it backwards and away from the item. The item should loosen or pop out on its own. Tilt the mold upside-side to tip the item out., Fill the mold with clay, then pull the clay out, and let it dry. You can also try to use resin in this mold as well, but let it cure and harden first. 

fill a bowl with water.  stir some liquid soap into the water.  squeeze some construction silicone into the water.  knead the silicone while it is submerged.  form the putty into a thick disk.  press your desired item into the silicone.  let the silicone harden.  pull the item out of the mold.  use the mold. 

 Sit down and write out a timeline for your project or goal. This will help you to stay on track, and you can refer back to it when your motivation wanes. For example, if your goal is exercising, on your timeline state that you would like to be able to run a mile in one month. Then make a mini plan for how you will accomplish that goal between now and your one-month mark. Cutting up your goal into increments of time will help you stay focused and keep you from becoming overwhelmed.  Control your inner dialogue and practice positive self-talk. Replace negative self-talk such as, “I can’t do it,” “I’m not the best,” “I’m not smart enough,” with positive self-talk such as, “I can do it,” “I am the best,” and “I am smart; if they can do it, I can do it.”, Stick with your goal by realizing that every process has an ebb and flow. Motivation is not a constant thing. There will be times when you are doing a great job of sticking to your timeline and your goals. However, other times, your motivation will wane, but know that this feeling is not a permanent, lasting feeling. Stick it out and wait for that motivation to come back., When your motivation is low, read a book or a blog about your goal. For example, if your goal is to publish a book or a journal article, read a book about writing for journals and publishers. These books have great tips for staying focused.  You can also ask for support when having trouble sticking to your goal. Join an online forum, ask a friend, mentor, or a family member. Remember that talking it out will help you resolve the issue.  

make a timeline.  practice positive self-talk.  don’t give up.  read a book or a blog about your goal.  ask for support. 

 Make sure the length of the towel is hanging down the length of your body. This step is best done while standing., Take one corner of the towel over about two-thirds of the way across the short side of the towel. Create a crease down the length of the towel., Take the other corner to create a layer over the first third. This will create another crease down the length of the towel. Your towel should now be long and skinny down the length of your body., Tuck the towel under your chin and pinch the towel halfway down the length. Let go of the towel with your chin and allow it to fold over at the halfway point., Tuck the towel under your chin again and pinch the towel halfway down the length. Let the towel go from the grip of your chin and allow the towel to fold once again at the halfway point. 

hold the towel by the corners.  fold over one corner.  fold over the other corner.  fold the towel in half.  fold the towel in half again. 

 Get all your ingredients ready to cook.; , Take your large knife and firstly top and tail the potatoes, then slice in half. If they are a little small, slice more off both ends and make one half instead of two.  Taking your melon ball maker and one half of a potato, scoop out the centre.   Place the ball of potato into a bowl. Repeat with all the potatoes.  Place the saucepan under a medium heat, halfway filled with water, now add in the halved potatoes and allow to cook for 15-20 minutes or until they are soft.   Check to see if they are cooked by taking a knife and softly piercing through the skin. When cooked, using the slotted spoon, carefully drain and transfer them to a baking tray covered in kitchen towel. There is no need to salt at this stage as you will be seasoning later on.  Place a small saucepan under a medium-high heat, now add one tablespoon of olive oil, green chilli, chopped garlic and slowly mix it in. Add the chopped tomato, stir in, season with salt and pepper and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until you achieve a nice thick consistency. If you are going to serve the potatoes soon then you will need to pre-heat the oil. So pour in the litre of vegetable oil into a large pan and bring to high heat.  Before frying, you can test to see if the oil is hot enough by placing one potato in the oil using your slotted spoon. If it bubbles, it is ready. You will need to cook the potatoes in 3 batches, so place the first batch using your slotted spoon into the hot oil. And allow to fry for roughly 3 minutes.   When the first batch is ready, remove them using your slotted spoon and place them onto a tray with some kitchen roll to drain. Now, place the second batch of potatoes into the hot oil and when ready, remove with your slotted spoon and transfer to the tray to drain. Then place the final batch into the hot oil and fry. Remove when ready and once more drain on the tray.  With your potatoes still on the tray now season with salt.     Garnish with crème Fraiche and caviar. Place four halved potatoes onto the tray. With a teaspoon, heap a dollop of crème fraiche into the centre of each potato. Place a generous dollop of caviar on top and finally sprinkle some chopped spring onion on top.  Garnish with tomato sauce and spring onion. Place four more halved potatoes onto the platter and with a teaspoon heap a generous amount of tomato sauce into each centre. Now garnish with the chopped spring onion.  Garnish with sour crème and bacon. Again, place four more potatoes onto the tray and heap a generous dollop of sour cream into each centre. Place a few bacon bits on top.  Tidy up the tray and present to the table or serving area.  

prepare the ingredients.  cut the potatoes.  scoop out the potatoes.  cook the potatoes.  cook the tomato sauce.  fry the potatoes.  season the potatoes.  add the three different garnishes.in preparation for serving your canapés, place the potatoes onto a large serving platter.  serve. 

 Add an oval, which will be a basis for the head. Your image should look like a woman in a long skirt to begin with, mostly because Aladdin's outfit is comprised of very loose-fitting clothing and that's just how his profile is.; , Add a few ovals to serve as arms and legs. Add more ovals and circles for hands and feet.  Draw even more lines and semicircles, so the arms start looking more muscular, and start connecting shapes.  His vest is open on his chest and his pants are baggy (a little bit puffy, even). His hat is a fez, and it sits squarely on his head, which is tilted slightly back.  Draw the facial features: eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth as seen here. Sketch his chest and the lining/patch of his pants, as well as his fingers and toes.  Try to make some lines softer and add extra details where needed.  Now color your creation! You can follow the illustration here or give him your own unique look, whatever you want to do.  

draw a rectangle on top of a trapezoid.  sketch guidelines across aladdin's body, as shown.  add lines for hair.  draw parts of aladdin’s clothes.  add more details.  erase unnecessary lines.  use felt pen to outline the image of aladdin. 

,, Then add the cream. To add, pour it over the back of a spoon––doing this ensures that the cream remains on the surface of the coffee.  In case guests want to know, inform them that this coffee is meant to be left alone and drunk through the layer of cream, rather than mixed in.  

place the sugar and irish whiskey into a warm, tall stemmed glass.  ,  fill the glass two thirds full with the hot coffee.  ,  stir briefly.  serve. 

 Your doctor will prescribe (or recommend an over-the-counter version of) an anti-worm medication. Some examples include Mebendazole, Pyrantel permeate, and Albendazole.You will be directed to take one dose of one of these medications (follow the specific instructions of your doctor) and then to wait two weeks.   The way this medication works is that it kills off any adult worms. They are all eradicated, except for the eggs which will remain in your system.; , The purpose of this second dose is to kill any new worms that have formed as a result of the eggs. The two week timing is extremely important, as it catches the worms at just the right phase in their lifecycle so as to kill all of them without needing any further doses after this one.  It is better to be safe rather than sorry, and to prevent the hassle of someone in the household showing signs of an infection just after the initial person was cured.  This is especially true if you are treating pinworm infections in children.Although pinworms can technically be treated with six weeks of very strict hygiene measures (because the lifecycle of the worm is six weeks), it is very challenging to adhere by these strict standards at home, particularly if children are involved.   The benefit of medication is that it is extremely effective at clearing the infection in two weeks. Hygienic measures can then be used as a means to prevent re-occurence or subsequent infections down the road.  Therefore, excellent hygienic measures at home are key to preventing the spread of threadworms to everyone who lives in the household, as well as to supporting a cure for the person who was initially infected.  Clean with water and regular household cleaners (no special products are needed). Use gloves when you clean to keep your hands clean.  This will help to get rid of the threadworms faster by preventing spread of the infection.  It is also important to wash your pyjamas regularly (or whatever you sleep in), as well as the clothes you have been wearing, for the same reason of avoiding re-contaminating yourself with eggs. This will help to clear up the infection faster by removing eggs that will simply continue the lifecycle of the threadworm, making it more challenging for you to regain your health and wellbeing.  People, especially children, may be tempted to scratch around the anus to alleviate the itch. However, this is one of the worst things you can do, because your hands then immediately become contaminated with eggs, which will spread to everything you touch after that. Therefore, to reduce the spread and transmission of threadworm eggs, avoid scratching around the anus.   Also avoid applying ointments or creams to the anal area in an effort to soothe it. This may cause the female worms to lay eggs higher up in your rectum or colon, which makes the problem worse not better.  Common signs and symptoms include:   Itching and irritation around the anus Potential signs of irritation or infection on the skin around the anus (particularly in children, who are more likely to scratch there which can lead to an infection from broken skin) Difficulty sleeping (due to anal itchiness) Irritability (from itchiness and poor sleep) Sometimes vaginal itchiness or irritation in girls (as on rare occasions the female worm can enter the vagina rather than the anus). "If you suspect you or someone in your household may have threadworms, contact your doctor as soon as possible. As previously mentioned, rapid diagnosis and treatment is key to getting rid of the infection as soon as possible. For a tape test, the doctor will ask you to take a piece of cellophane tape and press the stick-side against the skin surrounding the anus. Remove the tape and put it in a plastic bag and give it to your doctor, who will check under the microscope for the presence of eggs. Eggs can only be visualized under the microscope. A test positive for eggs is diagnostic for a threadworm infection.   Do the tape test first thing in the morning, before showering or using the toilet. Make sure you wear gloves and wash your hands thoroughly to avoid spreading the eggs. Don't let the tape touch anything, either!  , This is because your risk is high enough, so it is better to be safe than sorry and the benefits of treatment far outweigh the risks.  

take one dose of an anti-worm medication.  take another dose at the two week mark.after two weeks have passed, you will be directed to take one more dose of the same anti-worm medication.  treat everyone in the household.since threadworms are so easily passed from one person to another, your doctor will likely recommend that everyone in the household be treated with two doses of the anti-worm medication.  know that medication is your best bet.  understand how threadworms are spread.threadworms can be transmitted from person-to-person contact with an infected person, as well as from touching objects that may be contaminated with eggs such as a toilet seat, bedding, or other things.  wash toilet seats daily.because eggs are laid around the anal area, it is important to clean the toilet seats at least once a day to avoid contaminating others with threadworm eggs, and also to avoid re-infecting yourself with more eggs.  wash your hands regularly, especially if you are infected.pay particular attention to washing your hands both before meals and/or food preparation, as well as after using the toilet.  change your bed sheets at least twice a week.in order to effectively get rid of threadworms, you need to change and wash your sheets to get rid of any eggs that may be present.  avoid scratching around the anus.because female worms migrate toward the anus and lay eggs there, the anus can become particularly irritated and itchy.  recognize the symptoms of a threadworm infection.the sooner you can catch the infection the better, as that way you can start medical treatment and hygienic prevention measures at home as soon as possible.  administer a "tape test.  opt for treatment anyway if you live in the same household.it is key to understand that if you are in the same household as someone diagnosed with threadworms, you will be advised to take the medication (and to practice the hygienic measures) without needing to be formally diagnosed with threadworms. 

 If you’re preoccupied with unpleasant memories, you won’t have fun at the reunion. Instead, eat, mingle, and act normally. Cherish the opportunity you have to reconnect with old friends and classmates.Instead of focusing on the former bully, focus on the good people whose company you enjoy.  It simply means you realize that they are not worth your time and energy.Don’t let your pride or emotions push you to confront the former bully unnecessarily.   Also keep in mind that your bully will likely not engage with you either, so not approaching your bully is nothing to worry about. Focus on reconnecting with the people you enjoyed spending time with in high school and who treated you with respect.  If your former high school bully reaches out to you either before or during the reunion, you are under no obligation to speak with them.You don’t owe them anything, and you should not be made to feel that you do.   If a former bully tries to engage you in conversation -- even pleasant conversation -- you are perfectly within your right to excuse yourself. You can be direct or indirect when excusing yourself. You might simply go get something to drink, or you could be direct with the former bully and say what’s on your mind. For instance, you might say, “I’m not really interested in speaking with you because you were rotten to me when I was growing up. Good day.” Turn on your heel and walk away.  Are they still a loudmouthed jerk? Or have they softened with age?Watch how they behave from afar.   Do they talk pleasantly with everyone? Or do they exclusively stick with their old clique? If they’re talking with everyone, they might be less combative and mean-spirited than they were back in high school. If you can, try to pick up on a bit of their conversation as well to figure out if they've changed for the better. If you think they are reformed, consider talking to them about your feelings. If they seem to be unchanged and obnoxious, stay away from them.  Even if you don’t speak to your former bully, seeing them might make it easier to accept that the past is past. After the reunion, work to address any lingering impacts the bullying may have had on you.  

connect with friends and family.  acknowledge that avoiding a former bully doesn’t make you weak.  don't feel obligated to engage with former bullies.some wounds never heal.  observe the former bully.  move on with your life.just seeing your bully, whether he/she is well-adjusted and pleasant or still a jerk, may give you a sort of catharsis. 

 Pick a shape for your shield using images of Roman shields for inspiration. The most iconic scutums were rectangular with rounded edges, though circular and oval shields were used as well. The basic rectangular shield will probably be the best place to start—keep in mind that it will be more difficult to cut complex shapes and curved edges., You'll need a single large sheet of cardboard to cut out the body of your shield. The cardboard should ideally be flat, so that the shield doesn't accidentally contain any part of the hinged box top, and big enough to cut out your shield in a single piece. Finding an unused cardboard shipping or appliance container may be your best best, or you can sometimes find measured single sheets of cardboard at craft stores.If you're having trouble finding a piece of cardboard big enough, check with some local businesses to see if they have any to give away. Places like post offices and grocery stores are often happy to get rid of surplus boxes.A refrigerator box would make an ideal base for the rectangular, body-length Roman shield.  Use a pencil to sketch out the desired shape of your shield on the cardboard. Make the outline slightly larger than the actual size you want your shield to be if you wish to fold and secure the edges later for a cleaner, more rounded finish. Go over the outline with a dark felt-tipped marker so that it's more visible when you begin cutting.If you'd rather, if you can sketch the outline of your shield onto a separate piece of posterboard or scrap of newspaper first, then cut this out and use it to trace around the cardboard for a more precise shape. To account for the folded edges of your shield, draw two concentric outlines on the cardboard, one about 2" larger around the smaller outline. You'll cut out the shield at the outer outline and fold it to the inner one.  Use an X-acto knife, box cutter or other straight cutting implement to cut out the outline of your shield. Go slowly and try to make the edges as precise as possible. Make sure you lay the cardboard on a surface safe for cutting, such as a crafting table.Take extreme caution when handling any cutting tool. Straight cutters are designed to be very sharp, and accidents can happen if you're not careful. Always cut in short, smooth motions and go slowly. You can use scissors if you have no other option, but the blades are not as sharp, and the pressure of them against the cardboard may cause it to crush and cut poorly.  Once you've cut out your basic shield shape, make another small cut of about 2" at each corner of the shield, or at intervals of around half a foot if you're creating a circular shield. Making these cuts will create "flaps" that you can then fold and tape down on the backside of the shield, giving the shield a thicker, rounded appearance.Remember to cut the outline of your shield several inches larger if you decide to fold the edges of the cardboard.  Using the cardboard you have remaining, cut out a thin rectangular section to serve as the handle on the backside of the shield. This piece should be 8–10 inches (20.3–25.4 cm) long and 2-3 inches wide to make sure that it's sturdy enough to stay in place. Bend the rectangular strip so that the handle is squared, with a short flap on either side to tape down against the shield. Use duct tape or another strong adhesive to attach the handle to the shield.If you wish, you can cut a second strip of cardboard to serve as a forearm strap, which will brace the shield against the forearm and allow you to control it better.  To make the body of the wooden shield, you’ll need a single large wood board; the size and type of wood you use will depend largely on preference, although it was standard for the Roman shield to be about a foot shorter than its wielder and a few inches wider on either side. You can usually have wood cut to your specifications at home improvement stores like The Home Depot. Plywood is a cheaper option and will be useful if you intend to pad the shield for use in role playing activities.Assuming you don’t want to spend the money to have a piece of wood cut specifically for your shield, you can visit a lumber yard or recycling center to salvage unused scrap wood for little or no cost. If you’re unable to find a wood board large enough, piece together one of the right size using smaller individual pieces, like planks from a wooden pallet.  Find handle that can be used to provide a grip for the back of the shield. A basic door handle, like those used on screened doors, will probably be your cheapest and most readily available option.You could also use a thick strip of leather, in addition to the handle, to craft a forearm strap. Make sure you have a set of wood screws and a basic screwdriver to attach the handle to the shield.A plain metal handle will look best in keeping with the appearance of the shield. Scrap leather can usually be bought in craft stores, or online. Cut the leather to the exact size you want for the strap.You will only need two wood screws, unless you decide to attach a leather forearm strap as well, in which case four will do the job.  Before you begin putting together the individual components of the shield, quickly inspect the wood board you’re using for any imperfections. Splinters, cracks and uneven places can all compromise the integrity of the shield, and if untreated they can leave the shield with a rough, unappealing appearance. Take whatever measures necessary to ensure that the wood is smooth and symmetrical.   Cracks or breaks in your wood board can be sealed using Epoxy., Place the handle where you want it to go on the shield’s back side. Centering the handle will give the shield the best balance and leverage for movement, but it can also go slightly to one side or the other if it suits your personal preference. Use a pencil to mark where the screws should go in the handle.   Allow room for a strap. If you wish to add a leather forearm strap in addition to the handle, account for this in the layout on the back of the shield. Measure the distance from the thickest part of the forearm to the palm. If you’re right-handed (which means you would carry the shield in your left hand), place the strap and handle the appropriate distance from one another in the center of the shield with the handle on the right. If you’re left-handed, reverse this configuration.To center the handle and strap together, take a measurement of the total width of the shield and subtract your forearm-to-hand measurement from that, then divide this number in half to tell how you how much space you should have remaining on either side of the strap and handle once they’re attached.  Line the handle up with the markings you made for where the screws should go on the back of the shield. Hold the handle still (or tape it down, if necessary) while you insert a wood screw into the top hole in the handle and screw it into place. Do the same for the bottom hole, tightening both screws and making sure they’re both straight and secure.   If you’re bolting the handle to the wood, use the paddle bit to bore about half an inch into the wood, then drill the rest of the way through and insert the bolt. Tighten with the socket head bit.Plywood and other lightweight pieces will likely be too thin to bolt successfully.  Use craft paint (or acrylic paint if you're making a wooden shield) to brush an authentic Roman design onto your shield. Scour the internet or reference books on Roman military history to find inspiration for emblems and ornamentation. Some popular design elements are wings, griffins and leaf-like patterns.Print a template off the internet and make it a guide for a stencil you can use to spray paint your design on for a clean finish.Create your own original design in the same style as traditional Roman weapon-works for a personalized shield. Use painter’s tape to help you paint precise lines and edges.  Once you’ve got your shield assembled and painted, apply a thin coat of clear lacquer to the front side of the shield. This will protect both the wood and paint from smearing, cracking and peeling as a result of wear or water damage, as well as giving the shield a gleaming, polished finish. If you’re making a padded shield, skip the lacquer and finish with a layer of clear acrylic primer.When applying lacquer or any chemical gloss, be sure to do so in an open, well-ventilated area, and wear a face mask if possible.  For role playing activities, weapons and armor typically have to be approved for safe use. In this scenario, you’ll need to apply a layer of foam padding to the shield so that the wooden surface is not exposed. Cut 1” wide strips of foam and glue them in a grid pattern the length and height of your shield, then glue a solid sheet of foam over the top. Draw the design of the shield directly onto the foam using acrylic paint.To increase the safety of your shield for recreational use, add a few strips of foam around the inner edge of the shield (the side you’ll be on while holding it) to pad it against your own body.  You’re finished! You now have a solid, handmade replica Roman shield to wear to your next costume party or proudly show off. To mount your shield for display, attach a short length of framing wire to the back side of the shield and use a couple wall mounting hooks to hang it. Use your shield to adorn a bare section of wall in your home, or take a padded shield out for a spin at your next LARP event.If you plan to use your shield when it’s not being displayed, find a place to attach the framing wire where it won’t interfere with your grip.  

decide on a shape for your shield.  find a large piece of cardboard.  sketch the outline of the shield onto the cardboard.  carefully cut out the shield.  cut and fold at the corners to "round out" the shield.  cut out the handle and attach it to the shield.  find a broad, flat piece of wood.  acquire a handle to serve as a grip for the shield.  check to see that the wood is smooth and uniform.  center the handle on the back of the shield.  screw the handle into the wood.  paint on a design.  brush some protective lacquer on wooden shields.  add a protective layer of foam.  prepare your shield for display.

 Blow up roughly one dozen white balloons using your mouth or a portable air pump. Knot the openings of each balloon to prevent air from escaping.   You can vary the number of balloons to create larger or smaller clouds as desired. If desired, you could experiment by filling the balloons with helium, but the results might seem less than spectacular. The helium will give the cloud a slight lift, but due to the weight of the other materials, the cloud may not rise very high. Moreover, the helium will eventually leak out, causing the cloud to sink even further.; , Spread a large drop cloth over your work surface. Set the balloons and the remaining supplies on top of this cloth.  Arrange the balloons in a pile, altering the shape of the pile as needed to form the shape of a cloud. Carefully tape the finished form together with masking tape.   Play around with the placement of your balloons, and consider adding more balloons to the pile or taking some away. Clouds are naturally lumpy and unevenly shaped, so there's no need for perfection here. Work carefully during this stage to avoid accidentally popping the balloons. Punctured balloons won't matter much once you set the final shape with dried paper mache, but you still need to keep them intact for the time being.  Mix a batch of paper mache paste in a medium bucket and tear apart 20 to 30 sheets of newsprint into thick ribbons.   Paper mache paste made with flour is recommended for this project. Whisk together three parts water with one part flour until the paste becomes smooth.For clouds made with a dozen balloons, 6 cups (1.5 L) of water and 2 cups (500 ml) of flour should work well. Tear the newsprint into crosswise shreds measuring 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15 cm) wide. , Then apply the shred to the surface of the balloon. Repeat as often as needed until the entire balloon structure is covered.   Keep the cloud lightweight by letting the excess paste drip off as you lift each strip from the bucket. Use your hands to smooth out the strips as you apply them, leaving as few wrinkles as possible. Make sure that the connecting space in between individual balloons also gets covered.  Set aside the cloud base and allow all of the paste to dry. This may take 12 to 24 hours.   You should be able to get rid of any extra paste and newsprint ribbons during this time since later steps do not require them. , Gently press polyester fiber stuffing into the adhesive.   Grab a handful of stuffing and bunch it up before sticking it in place. Do not stretch the stuffing across the surface of the cloud since doing so will not create the correct effect. Repeat the process as needed until you cover the entire cloud with stuffing, working in small patches to prevent the adhesive from drying out after application. Take your time to ensure a better result.  Allow all of the spray adhesive to dry so that the stuffing remains secure. Use your fingers to gently pluck, fluff, and maneuver the stuffing as needed to improve the appearance.  The process should now be complete, and the balloon cloud should be ready to use.   If desired, you can pierce the top of the paper mache base and weave sturdy twine through the opening. Doing so will puncture the balloon lying beneath the surface, but the paper mache should be sturdy enough to continue holding its form. Use the twine to hang the cloud from a hook, branch, or similar object.  

inflate the balloons.  cover your work surface.  tape the balloons together.  prepare your paper mache supplies.  dunk each newsprint shred into the paste.  ,  coat the balloons in paper mache.  let everything dry.  apply an even coat of spray adhesive to one of the cloud lumps.  ,  apply the stuffing in patches.  dry and adjust as needed.  use your new balloon cloud. 

 Fabric dye works best on natural fabrics such as cotton, linen and silk. Synthetics such as rayon and nylon are also good candidates. There are a couple of fabrics that won’t accept dye well – 100% polyester and spandex. Avoid attempting to dye those.   It’s recommended that you don’t attempt to dye the fabric of any garment labelled “dry clean only”. The different fabrics absorb dye differently from one another, with results that vary in appearance. If you are concerned about a particular garment, test a swatch first.; , Cover your entire workspace with plastic or newspaper before you begin. Make sure to have sponges and paper towels within reach in case of spillage. Use plastic buckets, stainless steel buckets or a stainless steel sink to create your dye bath.   Don’t use bath tubs made of porcelain or fiberglass for any part of the dyeing process because they will stain. You will need to be wearing rubber gloves during the entire dyeing and rinsing process., 140°F/60°C is the maximum temperature you can use and will result in the deepest black color. Make sure you use enough hot water to completely submerge your garment.If you want the deepest black and your tap water doesn’t get hot enough, use a stove, teakettle or microwave to heat the water.  Be sure to dissolve it thoroughly and use a chopstick or any other handy tool you don’t mind staining to stir the mixture until well mixed. If you’re using liquid dye, all you need to do is shake it well before adding it to the bucket.   Check the dye packaging to make sure you are using enough dye for the amount of clothing you’re dying. The amount needed varies from product to product, so consult the packaging or insert for exact measurements.  Make sure that the mixture blends well into the hot water. There needs to be enough water in the bucket so that your garment can move around freely and be stirred while in the dye bath. This is so that your garment will get evenly dyed.Add one tablespoon of laundry detergent to the dye bath. This will help promote dye absorption. Make sure that you stir the laundry detergent into the dye bath until it is well dissolved. When dyeing cotton, rayon, ramie, or linen, add 1 cup of table salt to the dye bath. This will intensify the color. When dyeing nylon, silk and wool, add 1 cup of white vinegar to the dye bath to intensify the color., The longer your garment is left in the dye bath, the darker the result will be. Garments can be left in the bath for up to 1 hour. You will need to constantly agitate and stir the garment while it’s submerged in the bath.   Try to keep the temperature of the water as consistently hot as possible, so have a stove top, microwave or tea kettle nearby to heat water up to use to refresh the dye bath. Another option would be to use a large stainless steel pot for the dye bath and go through the process with the pot being heated on the stove to keep a consistent temperature.If you soak your clothing in plain hot water for a few minutes before putting them in the dye bath, it will smooth them out so that they can accept dye even more easily., Warm water removes the dye on the surface of the garment more efficiently. After the warm rinse, then rinse in cold water. Keep rinsing until the water runs clear.   When you remove the items from the dye bath, they will be wet and appear darker than the final result will be. Turn your items inside out and place them in the washing machine.Wash them alone in warm water with a mild detergent. Use the gentle cycle.  You can dry your items either way, but hang drying clothing preserves their dark colors, so it’s probably a better idea to get in that habit. Once dry, your clothing is ready to wear.   For the first 3 times you wash your newly dyed clothing after wearing, wash the items alone in cold water using the gentle cycle and mild, non-bleach detergent. After that you can wash the dyed items with other items of the same color that haven’t been dyed, but make sure it’s always in cold water and using a mild detergent. 

determine if your fabric will receive dye.  prepare your workspace.  fill your bucket or stainless steel sink with very hot water.the hotter the water, the deeper the color result.  pre-dissolve your powder dye in a separate container in very hot water.  pour the mixture into your dye bath (the bucket/sink).  submerge your garment in the dye bath.  remove the clothing from the dye bath and rinse it in warm water first.  hang or machine dry the clothing. 

 If you had normal or high blood pressure and then had a sudden onset of low blood pressure, you should seek medical attention immediately. New onset low blood pressure can be a major warning sign of life-threatening illness, especially for people with diabetes.   Even if the sudden drop in blood pressure is your only symptom, contact your doctor.  Some medications lower your blood pressure as a side effect.Discuss with your doctor whether any of your current medications could be lowering your blood pressure and if a change in your prescription medication regimen could help you raise your low blood pressure., Low blood pressure could be a sign of another medical condition such as diabetes, heart disease, cortisone deficiency, or a thyroid problem.Have your doctor evaluate you for other medical conditions if your low blood pressure remains a problem after making diet and lifestyle changes., Fludrocortisone and Midodrine are both medications that can help raise blood pressure. Ask your physician if one of these medications would be right for your situation.   People are not generally prescribed medicine for low blood pressure, as it's not often a cause for concern unless it presents with symptoms., If your low blood pressure is accompanied by other symptoms, or if you had normal or even high blood pressure and now you suddenly have low blood pressure, you should seek medical attention. If you experience any of the following symptoms with low blood pressure, call your doctor:Dizziness Fainting Difficulty concentrating Blurred vision Nausea Clammy or pale skin Rapid, shallow breathing Fatigue Depression Thirst  

seek medical attention if you are experiencing a sudden change in blood pressure.  request a change in your medications or dosages.  get tested for underlying medical conditions.  inquire about medications that raise blood pressure.  recognize warning symptoms. 

 The vehicle you will be driving in must have a valid tag and be in good mechanical condition.  The examiner will be evaluating the following skills:   Steering the vehicle and keeping it in the correct lane at all times. Performing basic maneuvers, such as turning left and right, backing up and parking in different situations. Using your turn signals appropriately and following right-of-way rules. An awareness of other drivers and pedestrians and appropriately responding to potential hazards. Knowing and adhering to traffic signs, signals and markings on the road.  You'll need to wait at least 1 day to retake the test. If you fail 3 times, you'll need to wait 30 days to retake it.  As of 2011, the license fee is $21.50 plus $4 for the application and $4 for each driving test retake.  

go to your local oklahoma dps office to take the oklahoma driving test.  demonstrate you can control and maneuver your vehicle during the test.  return to take the test again if you don't pass the oklahoma driving test the first time.  pay the necessary fees after you pass the oklahoma driving test. 

 It's okay to cry if you know your partner is leaving. Just remember that their departure is not the end of the world, and be sure not to procrastinate. The farewell may seem ages off, but give yourself plenty of time to prepare.; , Treat them to a meal at their favorite restaurant, take them to the cinema to see the movie they've been dying to watch. Enjoy your time together and make them realize how much "they'll" miss "you"!  , However, don't make them feel guilty for leaving. If they think you're upset with them, they'll worry about you and won't be able to enjoy their trip.  Have a movie marathon, read web-comics, settle in with a good book. Don't let your mind linger on their departure.  But remember that they're busy, either getting their work done or trying to relax. Constant interruption might prolong their stay. Call or text them goodnight to show that you're thinking of them. If you call during the day, keep it short but sweet.  On your calender, mark the halfway point of your spouse's trip. Work towards that first half, crossing off every day they've been gone. Once you complete that, the second part will get easier.  Make plans with family and friends, or get around to those things you've been putting off. Even if money won't allow you to do something special every day, new experiences will give you something to share with your spouse upon their return, and will return happiness to your life.  If you think happy thoughts, you will be happy.  Improve yourself while your partner is away. Break those bad habits, start the diet you've been talking about. Present them with a brand new you when they return.  It'll soothe you and allow you to be stronger, since those pent-up emotions won't be weighing you down.  

prepare yourself.  do something special before they leave.  expressing emotion on the day of their departure is fine.  distract yourself after they leave.  it's okay to contact your spouse during their trip.  make a countdown.  try to fill every day, rather than moping around the house.  stay positive.  absence makes the heart grow fonder, but don't skimp!,  give yourself time to cry. 

 You should check your hamster periodically for signs of poor health. Most medical problems are easier to treat if they're caught early on. Once a week, inspect your hamster to make sure he's in good health.   Check your hamster's nose and eyes. Both should be clear and free of discharge. Hamsters are prone to colds. If your hamster seems to be getting colds often, you may need to move his cage into a warmer part of the house. Hamsters are prone to eye infections and chronic eye problems like glaucoma. If you notice tearing, unusual discharge, or droopy and swollen eyelids take your hamster to a vet for evaluation.As your hamster ages, his fur may grow thinner and he might develop bald spots. This is normal. However, if you have a younger hamster who's developing flaky skin, bald spots, matted fur, or rashes take him to the vet for evaluation.Check your hamster for lumps each week. Hamsters are prone to benign skin growths but, in rare cases, new lumps can be cancerous. The sooner a cancerous lump is removed, the better chance your hamster has of recovery. If you notice a new growth on your hamster, make a vet appointment as soon as possible., When it comes to hamster health, prevention is always better than treatment. Take your hamster to the vet for a checkup at least once a year. In addition to yearly check-ups, a vet appointment might be necessary if you notice certain changes in your hamster's behavior or appearance.   Any sudden changes can be a sign your hamster is not feeling well. If your hamster gains or loses weight quickly, has any changes in energy, or seems disinterested in normal activities make an appointment with your vet. Keep an eye on your hamster's rear end. If you notice staining or stools suck to the fur around your hamster's anus, he may have digestive issues that need evaluation. If you notice a pungent smell coming from your female hamster, check for discharge on the area above her anus. Females are prone to infections of the womb that require fast medical intervention., Check your hamster's teeth and nails once a week. Your hamster's teeth should be yellow and the bottom teeth should be longer than the top. Nails should be long without curving inward. Long teeth or nails can cause irritation and may even puncture your hamster's skin, resulting in health problems. If your hamster's teeth or nails seem overgrown, make an appointment with your vet to have them trimmed., A healthy weight is important for your hamster. Hamsters generally gain weight until the age of 6 months. Their weight should be relatively stable until they reach 18 months. At that point, your hamster's weight will start decreasing slightly each month. Weight changes between 6 and 18 months may be a sign something is wrong.If your hamster is gaining weight, talk to your vet about his diet. You may need to find a different brand of pellet or cut back on his treats. If a change in diet does not result in weight loss, your vet may want to test your hamster for medical conditions that may be causing weight gain. If your hamster is losing weight, take him to the vet for evaluation. A variety of health problems can cause weight loss or loss of appetite in a hamster. Early detection can help provide more effective treatment for your hamster.  

watch for signs of poor health.  take your hamster to the vet when necessary.  keep your hamster's nails and teeth filed down.  help your hamster maintain a healthy weight. 

 Making flashcards is a very effective way to learn words. While you are writing down the words you are already learning them. It gives you also a possibility to see how the words are written. For this method you need:   2 pens/pencils in different colours Flashcards; , Write the translation with 1 colour on one side of the flashcard. Advantageous a dark colour like blue or black.  Take a bright colour like red, pink or orange. This will help you to remember the word because the translation will be in a dark colour. With this difference our brain is more likely to remember the word.Write down the word in Hiragana or Katakana. While you write it down you should say it out loud for several times. When you`ve finished, put the card away and try to say it again by heart. Then continue with the next word.  Go through the flashcard stack. If you know the word, put it on the "I know it" stack. If you got it right but you needed a lot of time, you should put it on the "Still need a bit of practice" stack. If you got it wrong, put it on the "I didn't know" stack.The most effective way to study words with flashcards is to repeat them several times in a day for about 5-10 minutes. You can study when:   You`re waiting for the bus You`re watching TV and they are showing advertising You`re having a break at school or work You`re cooking and waiting for your meal do be done  

use flashcards.  take your first word.  flip the flashcard.  start practicing. 

 For those who played GTA games already knows that most missions will give you a certain amount of money.; , Dying or getting busted will make you lose a bit of money. Granted, you won't lose a huge amount but it seriously will add up if you keep getting killed or busted.  Weapons in the shop is always too expensive or really unreasonable, so consider looking around the entire island for the weapons. Also you can find free health around the islands by collecting the icons with the heart or by hopping into an ambulance.  Those things would give you some money each time you collect them. Also the game will hand out free weapons when certain amounts has been collected.  

do missions.  don't get busted or die.  look for weapons, armor and health.  search for those hidden packages. 

 It takes ten obsidian to make a Nether portal. Once you have enough for two portals, however, you can use a trick to get infinite obsidian without needing to find lava.  If you don't have a portal already, place obsidian blocks in a vertical frame 5 tall x 4 wide. Activate it by using a flint and steel on the lowest obsidian block. This trick may not work if there is another portal close by.The corners of the portal do not have to be obsidian.  The Nether is a dangerous place, so prepare yourself if you haven't been before. You'll need the remaining ten obsidian blocks, but you might want to leave them safely behind and explore a safe route first. You'll need to travel a certain minimum distance in a straight, horizontal line (these numbers include a 3-block margin of safety just in case):PC, Pocket Edition, and Console Edition "large" worlds: travel 19 blocks. Console Edition "medium" worlds: travel 25 blocks. Console Edition "classic" worlds (including all PS3 and Xbox 360 worlds): travel 45 blocks. If you have multiple Overworld portals, walk away from their coordinates. This trick will not work if you are too close to an existing portal.  Build this in the Nether and activate it the same way you did the first one. When you walk through it, you should appear in a brand-new portal in the Overworld.   If you appear next to a portal you already built, you did not walk far enough in the Nether. Go back to the Nether and break your portal with a diamond pickaxe, then rebuild it somewhere else.  The portal that just appeared has fourteen obsidian blocks free for the taking. Mine these with a diamond pickaxe.  Each time you walk through the Nether portal you just built, a new portal will appear in the Overworld. Mine this for free obsidian. Speed this up if you want a large amount of obsidian:   Use a bed to set your spawn near the permanent Overworld portal. Place a chest near the temporary Overworld portal. Stash the obsidian and diamond pickaxe in the chest after mining the portal. Kill yourself to return to spawn. Walk through the Nether again and exit the same portal to create a new one. Build a tunnel between the Nether portals to increase safety.  

gather twenty obsidian by other means.  create a nether portal.  travel through the nether.  build a second portal.  mine the obsidian in the overworld portal.  exit the same nether portal to spawn a new one. 

 In order to convince your parents to let you have a dog, you need to be persuasive. You will be in a better position to convince them if you are well informed. Begin to research your presentation by looking into different dog breeds.When you talk to your parents, you will want to be as specific as possible. You will sound more convincing if you are able to make definitive statements such as, "Mom, Dad, the Jack Russell Terrier is the right dog for us." Start by looking at different dog breeds online. You can even take a quiz about what type of dog is right for you.Use some websites such as the American Kennel Club site to figure out what type of dog you should ask for. For example, if your sister might be allergic, look into a Yorkshire Terrier. If your mom is worried that a dog will be messy, you can look for a dog that doesn't shed heavily. Research dachshunds, which are a small, neat dog. Go to your local or school library. Ask the reference librarian to help you find some books that offer information about different breeds of small dogs.; , Adopting a dog is a great way to add a pet to your family. With adoption, you can rescue an animal who needs a home. You can also save money, as you won't have to pay an expensive breeder.Once you have an idea about some of the breeds you are interested in, contact your local animal shelter. The staff and volunteers there will be able to provide you with some helpful information. State that you are looking for a small dog and offer any other specific requirements that you have. For example, tell the staff whether you are looking for a puppy or an older dog. Ask if they regularly have a wide selection of dogs that might fit your needs. For example, you can say, "Will it be fairly easy to adopt a small dog such as a dachshund or terrier?" Collect other information. Find out what information you and your parents will need to provide in order to adopt a dog. You can also ask how long the process takes.  The best way to convince your parents to let you have a dog is to prepare a thoroughly researched presentation. You will definitely want to include the financial aspects of dog ownership in your request. Do some research about how much it costs to adopt and raise a dog.Talk to the experts. You can ask the staff at the shelter how much the adoption fees are and if you will need to pay for vaccinations. Contact a local vet. You can phone the office and ask for general pricing information. Ask how much it will cost to spay or neuter a dog, and how much regular office check-ups cost. Visit a local pet store. You can price food, toys, and grooming products. Combine all of your information to figure out the monthly cost of dog ownership. If you plan to pay for part of the dog's care, make that part of your presentation, too.  Your parents will want to make sure that you understand how much time it takes to care for a dog. For the next part of your presentation preparation, figure out how you will fit dog care into your family's routine. This will help show your parents that you have put a lot of thought into caring for the dog.Think about how much time it will take to exercise your dog each day. Do you have a yard where he can play independently? Or will you need to make sure to walk him? If you are asking for a puppy, think about how long it will take to train the dog. Are you planning to spend some time each day helping to house train the dog? Make a calendar that shows the breakdown of how much time you will spend caring for the dog. If you are asking other family members to help, make sure to make that clear.  

research dog breeds.  talk to a local shelter.  create a budget.  make a schedule. 

 To do this, hold the foot in both hands and give ten short, strong pulls on one side and then the other. Imagine the pulling motion of milking a cow while doing this.  Hold the side of the foot with both thumbs placed on the inside center of the arch. Move your hands back and forth as if you were wringing out a wet towel. Allow a lot of movement of the foot while applying this technique.  Petrissage is a type of massage that involves lifting and squeezing muscles to stimulate them.          Starting at the back of the heel and ankle around the achilles tendon, use one hand to gently squeeze and pull the foot. Start softly, but apply more pressure and speed the longer you do it. Push the muscles starting at the achilles tendon and working towards the toes. Doing this will lift the muscles of the foot, helping to work out impurities. Slowly work your way up to the lower calf using this technique. The muscles here attach to those in the foot, and using petrissage in this area can help to further relax the foot.  The long muscle begins near the achilles tendon and ends at the knee, and is closely tied to muscle movements in the foot.          Have your partner straighten their leg vertically, and use your forearm to apply pressure downward into the foot. Slowly move your arm so as to use your elbow to apply more pressure into the foot. With your partner laying down, grab their foot with one hand at the heel, with the foot running up your forearm. Push their whole foot towards the knee, applying light pressure at first and slowly adding more.  Hold the foot up, and use one hand to rotate the foot around the ankle. Move the foot in circles ten times in one direction, and then ten times in the opposite direction. The ankle joints may pop, but unless this causes the person any discomfort there is no need to stop.         , Add the usual requirements (see manufacturer's instructions) and also put a little Epsom salts and spa oil in the foot massager's base. Leave feet in for 20 minutes. They should feel wonderfully rejuvenated; finish up with a friend or family member massaging your nicely cleaned feet.          

apply the milking stroke.  use the indian rub technique.  try petrissage on the achilles tendon and lower foot.  massage the long muscle of the foot.  perform ankle rotations.  give a foot massage using an electric massager.

 To diagnose this you need an x-ray machine which you buy from vets b us for 1000 simoleons. On the examination table click on the x-ray icon then using the x-ray ball swivel the x-ray picture towards the animal and when the 4 lights at the corner of the x-ray picture turn green click your L button or the tick symbol with your stylus, and hopefully you'll get an x-ray of the pet. If it's broken a bone/limb a message will come up saying so., This also gives you time to train, dress up the pet etc. However make sure you give the pet plenty of time to rest so the bone/limb will set properly.,, Then leave it on for 5 days and on the 5th day (before the pet goes home) if you're quick you can take the bandages and neck cone off and dress the pet in some nice accessories! 

this is where some things change.  keep the pet for 5 days so the bone/limb can fully heal.you don't need any medicine but you do need bandages and a neck cone which you can purchase both from vets b us for 115 and 100 simoleons respectively.  to treat a broken bone/limb take the pet to the grooming table and dress it in the bandages and neck cone. 

 Labeling sexual body parts with fake names or nicknames may only confuse or delay your child’s understanding of their body. It also makes the act of sex and the body seem more private than it should be. You want to foster an open conversation. Call the sexual body parts by their proper name.For example, you might say, “Girls and women have vaginas. Boys and men have penises.” Of course, how you describe your child’s body may change as they mature. Many people feel more comfortable employing body part nicknames until a child reaches the age of 3 or so.  When your child asks for a description of how sex occurs it is best to offer a quick, clear description that leaves room for them to ask follow-up questions. You might talk about how the sperm can join with an egg and then that egg becomes a baby. This is a better way to approach the subject when compared with a “stork” discussion.For example, you could say, “You can get pregnant after having sex only once, as it only takes one time for a sperm and egg to join.”  , If you just talk about sex as a biological act, then your child may grow to view it as such. Make sure to emphasize the way that love often plays a part in sexual relationships. This is a great way to acknowledge the strong feelings that your child may be experiencing while also telling them that you can express love in other ways aside from sex.You might say, “What are some other ways of showing a person that you love them?”  , Your child may ask you directly about diverse sexual relationships. Talk about how some people of the same gender also partake in sexual and romantic relationships. If they are curious about these relationships, go online and research LGBT+ issues alongside your child.   You could ask, “Do you have any questions about LGBT relationships?”  , Sexual bullying is, unfortunately, becoming increasingly common at schools. Teach your children how to identify sexual pressure, as connected to peer pressure. Emphasize the benefits of saying, “No,” in uncomfortable situations. Let your child know that unauthorized touching or sex is never okay and that it is never their fault if something does happen.For example, you might tell your child, “No always means no. If someone asks you to stop, do so. And, if you ask someone to stop, then they should respect your words.” Both girls and boys need to understand the problems associated with sexual peer pressure. Make sure to have this conversation regardless of your child’s gender.  Tell your child that their safety is your first and foremost concern. Make safe sex a non-negotiable point in your conversation. Explain to them that sexual transmitted diseases can be carried and transmitted very easily unless sexual partners take the proper precautions, including testing. Discuss the use of contraceptive methods and how to prevent an unplanned pregnancy as well.You might say, “The decision to have unprotected sex can have many long-term consequences. Some STDs can stay with you for a lifetime.”  , You and your child can always sit down at the computer and search “sexual education materials” online. Then, you can both go through the information that your search turns up. Offer to purchase or download any books that your child expresses interest in.As you look through various books online, you might ask, “Would you like to order a few of these, so that you can look through them on your own as well?”  

use biological names.  explain intercourse in a clear and direct way.  talk about love, too.  discuss lgbt+ issues with your child.  talk about peer pressure and sexual assault.  stress the importance of safe sex.  show them materials created by a sex health care professional. 

 If you have a book, then read it. This is one way you can deflect attention from yourself. Put in your headphones, if you have them, and listen to your music. If you’re at the gym, you should focus on the exercise that you are doing. At some point, the person who is staring will get bored of looking at you.   By doing this, you will also be able to distract yourself and feel less tense about your predicament. You can pretend that you are reading, listening to music, or examining your fingernails. You just need to give the impression that you are busy.  You don’t want to let a creepy stranger’s actions affect your behavior. By dismissing them completely, you are showing them that they cannot bother you.  Yawn. Gaze into the distance. Try to show that you are completely unfazed by this continued observation. You can even try closing your eyes and pretending that you are asleep. If this is too frightening for you, you can try blinking in a manner that suggests that you are about to go to sleep.  

focus on an activity.  completely ignore unwanted attention.if you’re chatting with a friend, and someone is staring at you, just continue your conversation.  look bored. 

 The gel-based formulas can be used on wet or dry hair, but you may prefer to use it while your hair is dry. Root regrowth is easier to spot in dry hair, so you’ll be able to target the problem areas more successfully. Like its spray counterpart, most gel formulas wash out with your next shampoo.Check your brand for specifics, since there are a few out there that can last up to three shampoos.  Most gel-based formulas come in “wand” form, with a spongey applicator on the end that you use to “paint on” the concealer. Squeeze the wand until you see that the sponge is loaded with the gel. Dab at your hair with the applicator to paint on the gel, squeezing when necessary to reload the sponge., Only use enough product to fully cover the visible roots. You can always add a little more if you need additional coverage, but start off slow. Give the product a minute or so to penetrate your hair shaft. You may want to keep a towel or tissues nearby so that you can clean up any drips or spills immediately., Even if you’ve applied the gel formula to dry hair, blow drying it helps to evenly distribute the concealer and blend it into your hair so that it looks natural. Set your blow dryer to low heat and aim at your roots. Continue until the gel is no longer visible and your roots are completely dry. 

use it on wet or dry hair.  apply the gel to your roots.  cover all of your visible root regrowth with the gel.  blow dry your hair to blend the gel in. 

 Many homes have a water shut off behind the refrigerator. Sometimes you need to shut off the water to the entire house. In that case, open a faucet to let the water pressure bleed off. You do not want to continue until the water supply is off.; , It is much easier if you remove the contents (at least the liquids, which make up most of the weight).  In most cases, this will be a white plastic flexible pipe about the thickness of a pencil. The hose will run from the wall or floor to the refrigerator.  This is almost always the source of your leak. You may need to temporarily turn the water back on to find the leak. Remember to turn the water off again before proceeding.  Be sure that your cut is straight and there are no burrs or extra bits of plastic left behind.  The connector is available broadly. The connectors are less than two dollars before shipping. Buy extras because the water hose WILL leak again before you replace the refrigerator. The connect is a "push on" style, so you don't need tools to make the splice.  This is important, because there may be more than one leak. , You are done. Well done.  

turn off the water supply for the ice maker.  pull the refrigerator away from the wall.  find the plastic water hose that brings water into the refrigerator.  inspect the water hose.  cut the water hose with a sharp knife about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) on either side of the leak.  splice the two ends of the water hose with a 5⁄16 inch (0.8 cm) "union connector" that is expressly for this purpose.  turn the water back on and be sure that your splice is watertight.  push the refrigerator back into place.  ,  celebrate saving $100! 

 It should be of a decent height (tall enough for it to make a break in vision, and if possible, higher than the average person).; , These pieces will be joined together again in a way that allows them to be bent or folded.  Tie the first piece with the second piece, then tie the second piece with the third, using wire or rope.  Add more of this material until the plants completely cover the trellis.   The dried plant parts are best when they are of the same height (or longer) as the divider you are going to make. Live plant vines could also be used but they're trickier and you will need to place the container growing the plant down in its final place before weaving. Moreover, moving the divider is much harder when you do this, so it's best for a more "permanent" divider, such as for an office. Instead of dried plant parts, you can use artificial floral items, such as long leaves, etc.  Angle the three partitions so that the divider stands in place unaided. Plant containers or similar weighted objects can be used to prevent the divider from falling over if accidentally knocked.  

purchase a section of wooden trellis.  cut the wooden wall trellis into three equal pieces, vertically.  reattach the pieces to form the divider.  weave dried plant parts, one beside other, through the frame squares.  put the divider up where you need it. 

 Try to make it as creative as possible; if you're given the opportunity to choose your own, take advantage of this. Choose something you're particularly interested in because this will make it easier to write; in particular, try to select the topic as a result of pressing questions you already know you want to search for answers to. Once you've decided on a topic, be sure to hone down it to a do-able topic; often a topic is initially too broad in its coverage, which will make it impossible to complete within the time and space constraints given. Narrow down your topic to something that can really be worked within the boundaries of the paper. If the topic is already chosen for you, start exploring unique angles that can set your content and information apart from the more obvious approaches many others will probably take. Finally, whatever angle your topic takes, it should be both original in approach and insightful, something the reader will be drawn into and fascinated by.   Take great care not to choose a topic and be so set on how you see the outcome of your paper that you're closed to new ideas and avenues of thinking as you work through the paper. This is known in academia as "premature cognitive commitment". It can mar an otherwise good paper because an outcome that is pre-determined in your head, regardless of the research findings along the way, will be molded to fit the outcome, rather than the outcome reflecting a genuine analysis of the discoveries made. Instead, ask continuous questions about the topic at each stage of your research and writing and see the topic in terms of a "hypothesis" rather than as a conclusion. In this way, you'll be prepared to be challenged and to even have your opinion changed as you work through the paper. Reading other people's comments, opinions and entries on a topic can often help you to refine your own, especially where they comment that "further research" is required or where they posit challenging questions but leave them unanswered. For some more help, see How to establish a research topic.  It's pointless to launch into writing before you've done the research. You need to understand the background to the topic and the current thinking, as well as finding out what future research is considered necessary in the area. While it may be tempting to rehash information you already know really well, avoid doing this or you learn nothing from the research and writing process. Go into research with a sense of adventure and an openness to learning things you've yet to grasp, as well as being ready to discover new ways of looking at old problems. When researching, use both primary (original text, document, legal case, interviews, experiment, etc.) and secondary (other people's interpretations and explanations of the primary source) sources. There is also a place for discussing with like-minded students and even finding online discussions about the topic if you feel comfortable doing this but these discussions are for idea-sharing and helping you to gel your ideas and are not usually quotable sources. For more information, here are some helpful resources to check out:    How to research a paper.  How to take notes, How to take better notes, How to take notes from a textbook, How to take notes on a book and How to take Cornell notes.  After you've done the research, reflect back over the chosen topic. At this point, it's essential to pinpoint the single, strong idea you'll be discussing, your assertion that you believe you can defend throughout the paper and that makes it clear to a reader what they're about to learn about and be given a sound conclusion on. Your thesis statement is the spine of your essay, the idea that you'll go on to defend in the paragraphs that follow. Serve it up half-baked and the remainder of the paper is bound to be flavorless. Construct a thesis that your research has proven is interesting to you – that way, backing it up won't be such a bore. Once you're satisfied that your topic is sound and clarified, proceed to writing your first draft.   Remember that the research doesn't stop here. And nor does the thesis statement, necessarily. Allow room for flexibility as you continue working through both the research and the writing, as you may wish to make changes that align with the ideas forming in your mind and the discoveries you continue to unearth. On the other hand, do be careful not to be a continuous seeker who never alights upon a single idea for fear of confinement. At some point you are going to have to say: "Enough is enough to make my point here!" If you're so taken with a topic, there is always the possibility of postgraduate study some day but remember that the term paper has a finite word length and due date!  , Some people can work on a term paper skipping this step; they're a rare and often time-pressed breed. It is far better to have an outline sketched out so that you know where you're headed, just as a road map helps you to know where you're going from A to B. Like the entire paper, the outline is not set in stone but subject to changes. However, it does give you a sense of structure and a framework to fall back on when you lose your way mid paper and it also serves as the skeleton of your paper, and the rest is just filling in the details. There are different approaches to developing an outline and you may even have your own personal, preferred method. As a general guidance, some of the basic elements of an outline should include:   Introduction, discussion paragraphs/sections and conclusion or summary. Descriptive or explanatory paragraphs following the introduction, setting the background or theme. Analysis and argument paragraphs/sections. Using your research, write out the main idea for each body paragraph. Any outstanding questions or points you're not yet sure about. See How to write an outline for more details.  The introductory paragraph is challenging but avoid turning it into a hurdle. Of all the paper, this is the part often most likely to be rewritten as you continue working through the paper and experience changes of direction, flow and outcome. As such, see it as simply a means of getting started and remind yourself that it's always revisable. This approach allows you the freedom to mess it up but rectify it as needed. Also use this as an opportunity to help yourself come to grips with the general organization of the term paper by explaining the breakdown, something the reader will also need to be aware of from the start. Try using HIT as the means for getting your introduction underway:    Hook the reader using a question or a quote. Or perhaps relate a curious anecdote that will eventually make absolute sense to the reader in the context of the thesis.  Introduce your topic. Be succinct, clear and straightforward.  Thesis statement. This should have been clarified already in the previous step.  Don't forget to define the words contained in the question! Words like "globalization" have many differing meanings and it's important to state which ones you'll be using as part of your introductory section.  Make sure each paragraph supports your argument in a new way. Not sure your body's up to task? Try isolating the first sentence of each paragraph; together, they should read like a list of evidence that proves your thesis.   Try to relate the actual subject of the essay (say, Plato's Symposium) to a tangentially related issue you happen to know something about (say, the growing trend of free-wheeling hookups in frat parties). Slowly bring the paragraph around to your actual subject, and make a few generalizations about why this aspect of the book/subject is so fascinating and worthy of study (such as, how different the expectations for physical intimacy were then compared with now).  Try using the ROCC method:    Restate your thesis statement.  One important detail which is usually found in your last paragraph.  Conclude – wrap it up.  Clincher – where you give the reader something left to think about.  Using outside sources? Find out which citation style your instructor prefers, MLA or APA (or other style if you're not in the USA). Each has a precise notation system, so if you're unsure of the rules, check the manual (online versions are available at owl.English.Purdue.EU). Peppering quotes throughout your text is certainly a good way to help make your point, but don't overdo it and take care not to use so many quotes as the embodiment of your points that you're basically allowing other authors to make the point and write the paper for you.   Avoid cutting and pasting from other people's arguments. By all means use eminent thinkers in the field's thoughts to back up your own thinking but avoid saying nothing other than "A says... B says...". The reader wants to know what you say ultimately. It's helpful to sort out your bibliography from the beginning, to avoid having a last minute scramble: How to write a bibliography, How to write an APA style bibliography and How to write a bibliography in MLA format.  Space is at a premium in any graded paper, so finding ways to cull words is always a sensible approach. Are your sentences in good shape? Examine each one and decide whether you've used the fewest words possible while still retaining meaning.   Trade in weak "to-be" verbs for stronger "action" verbs. For example: "I was writing my term paper" becomes "I wrote my term paper."  , Running your spelling-checker is only the first step in proofreading your paper! A spell-check won't catch errors like "how" instead of "show", nor will it pick up on doubled words ("the the") or grammar problems (unless you use MS Word, which can be configured to check grammar, and already catches double words). Little goofs like these aren't likely to impress the instructor – if you're too careless to proofread, after all, there's a good chance you didn't put much effort into your paper. Address the mess: ask a friend to read through your essay, marking any mistakes.   Decent grammar should be a given. You need a teacher to give you the benefit of the doubt, not correct your apostrophe use. A few too many errors and the message is soon lost beneath the irritation of the errors involved.  For some essayists, a great title appears at the beginning of writing while for others, it only becomes apparent after slogging through the paper in its entirety. If you're still stuck, brainstorm with a friend or family member; you might be surprised how a fresh mind unacquainted with the topic can come up with a pithy title at a moment's notice!  

choose your topic.  do your research.  refine your thesis statement.  develop an outline for the paper.  make your point in the introduction.  convince the reader with your body paragraphs.  conclude with strength.  show some style.  burn flab, build muscle.  don't be a such a slob.  think of a good title to catch the reader's attention, but not a too long or too short one! 

 Heat can help reduce pain from menstrual cramps and abdominal pain caused by Crohn’s disease. Turn a heating pad on the medium or high setting. Lay down, and drape the heating pad over the site of the pain. This may be on your abdomen or your lower back. Relax until the pain has lessened.   A hot water bottle also works. Fill the bottle with hot water. Set it against the source of pain. A warm shower or bath might be soothing as well.; , Massages can help you relax, and they can lessen symptoms during menstrual-related flares. Ask a massage therapist if they can perform therapeutic abdomen massages.You can also massage yourself. Lie down on a flat, comfortable surface. With both hands, start massaging the bottom right side of your abdomen. Move your hands up towards the left side of our body, then down towards the pelvis and the pubic bone. Follow this pattern for up to fifteen minutes., Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used to treat period pain, but they may actually worsen your Crohn’s flares by increasing bleeding and damaging the lining of your intestines. Common NSAIDs include: Aspirin,such as Bayer’s or Bufferin Ibuprofen such as Advil or Motrin Naproxen including Aleve and Naprosyn  , While NSAIDs are not encouraged for Crohn’s disease, you can take acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol) to relieve your pain. This includes brands like Tylenol, Panadol, and Anacin.Always read the label for dosage information. Do not take more than the recommended dosage. If you have a history of liver disease or drink more than three alcoholic beverages a day, do not take acetaminophen., It is important that you keep taking your normal dosage during flares, unless otherwise directed by your doctor. Even if your pain is getting worse during a flare, do not take more or less than your prescribed dosage without consulting a doctor.  If your pain is particularly bad around your period, your doctor may give you a special prescription to only take during these flares. This might be a corticosteroid that you only use while on your period.Make sure to tell your doctor when the flare usually occurs. For example, if it always comes the week before your period starts or if it starts the same day as your period.  

apply heat to the pain.  get a massage.  avoid nsaids.  take acetaminophen.  keep taking your prescriptions.  consult a doctor. 

 XHTML is written exactly like HTML, with a few stipulations:; , This should be placed at the very top of your document, and is written like: <?xml version='1.0' encoding=utf-8' ?> Adjust the encoding attribute to the proper encoding of your document. In most cases, this will be UTF-8.  The current version of XHTML, XHTML 1.0, defines three DTD's. These are "Strict", "Transitional", and "Frame set". Unless you have a good reason to do otherwise, use the Strict DTD. The DOCTYPE for the Strict DTD is: <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  , For example, use <p></p> for a paragraph instead of <P></P>.  For example, if you use <p> to start a paragraph, make sure there is a closing </p> at the end. Empty elements, such as <br> and <img> (which have no content inside of them) must be closed as well. Put a slash at the end of the tag: <br /> is the correct XHTML syntax for a line break.  This was also a requirement in HTML, but is especially important for XHTML. For example <b><i>Some text</b></i> is incorrect, because the <b> tag is being closed before the <i> tag even though it started first. The correct syntax would be: <b><i>Some text</i></b>.  In HTML it would be valid to write <a href=nextPage.html>Next Page</a>. However, in XHTML all attributes must be quoted: <a href="nextPage.html">Next Page</a>.  For example: <input type="checkbox" checked> should be <input type="checkbox" checked="checked" />).  Use XHTML for the content of your document (such as text, images, links, etc.) and use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to dictate how that content should be displayed to the user. HTML tags that are used for presentation (such as <font>) should not be used.  

before you can learn xhtml, you should first have a basic knowledge of html.  because xhtml documents are a type of xml document, they need an xml prologue.  all xhtml documents must have a document type declaration (doctype) right after the xml prologue.  all tag names must be in lowercase.  all tags must be closed.  tags must be correctly nested.  all attributes must be quoted.  minimized attributes should be written in the long form.  separate content and presentation. 

 Questions about your previous job are more about you than about your former employer. The interviewer is trying to gauge your skills and professionalism, not the virtues or vices of your previous boss. The goal of any answer about a previous job should be to make yourself look good, not your previous position look bad.   Answer questions about previous jobs by discussing your accomplishments in those positions. Consider key phrases from the description of the job for which your interviewing, such as "strong supervisory skills," and consider how you can frame your experience in your previous job to emphasize that you have what it takes for the new position. Whenever possible, go beyond buzzwords and give examples from your previous job. Pivot from a generality, such as "self motivated," by saying, "I know you've probably heard that before, so let me give you an example." Then have a brief two-to-four sentence anecdote from a previous job prepared that demonstrates your self motivation.; , It's not a good idea to be negative in a job interview about anything, and that's especially true when it comes to discussing your former employer. An interviewee badmouthing his or her former employer raises a red flag in most Human Resource departments.You should cast even the worst previous employment experience in a positive light.   Negativity raises questions about you, not your previous job. If you say bad things about your old boss, the interviewer will wonder: 1) what the other side of the story is, 2) whether you will be a "whiner" or a "complainer" in your new job if they hire you, and 3) if you will speak ill of them if you eventually leave their employ. Ultimately, speaking ill of your previous employer just makes you look unprofessional. No mater how much you disliked your old job, find something positive to say about it. Think of the office environment, training seminars, break room, flexible hours or anything else that appealed to you. Make the positive aspects of your old job the focus of your answer.  The one time that it's okay to say something less-than-positive about your previous position is in comparing your fit for your previous job with your fit for the one for which you're interviewing.   If, for instance, you were promised an exciting, challenging position at your last job and instead found yourself in a boring, repetitive desk job, you may want to mention this to the interviewer. Make sure that your description of your old job draws out the distinctions between that position and the one for which you're interviewing. More generally, it's okay to tell an interviewer your old job was a bad fit because you wanted more of a challenge, wanted more or different responsibilities, or wanted more opportunities for advancement. The key is to pick the phrase that best describes the job for which you're interviewing. Finish your comment with a phrase like “I’m excited about this opportunity because…” that will allow you to further outline the opportunities in the new position that were lacking in your past position and why you're excited for the new challenge., Brevity is often the best way to avoid negative or unprofessional answers. Answer the questions you are asked, but be careful not to volunteer too much information. This tip should be applied to all aspects of your interview, but especially to any references to your previous employer.The shortest answer is usually the best answer.Leave emotion out of your answers. No matter how personable the interviewer may seem, a job interview is a business interaction, and your words should reflect that fact. 

sell yourself.  don't badmouth.  pivot to the present.  keep it simple. 

 Stick a travel-size pack of tissues in your purse or luggage. This is the next closest thing to toilet paper.  You know that cardboard tube that's still hanging up on the roll when all the toilet paper is gone? Start peeling the layers of paper off it until you have enough to wipe with. Wet it at the sink to make it soft and comfortable. Flush when done.  Although popular among the Romans, this method is no longer considered a great idea. Sponges pick up filth and bacteria quickly, so you'd better know where the sponge has been. After you're done, submerge the sponge in diluted bleach, any product containing quaternary ammonium, or boiling water. Take it out after five minutes. 

carry around a tissue pack.  prepare the cardboard paper roll.  wipe with a sponge. 

 This is a very quick and easy way to make a heating pad. All you need is a zip-lock freezer bag, and some uncooked rice. Make sure the freezer bag is microwave safe, if not it'll melt and smoke and be a disaster. If you have just found a freezer bag around the kitchen and aren't sure if it's microwave safe, don't use it.  Once you are certain you have a bag you can use in the microwave, pour in some rice. Fill the bag so that it is about three quarters full with uncooked rice and then secure it with the zip-lock across the top., Warm it up in the microwave for a minute, adding another seconds to a minute if necessary. Once it is heated up, take it out out the microwave and wrap it in a hand towel or other piece of insulating fabric.You don't want to put the heated bag directly onto your skin.  

grab a zip-lock freezer bag.  pour rice into the bag.  pop it in the microwave. 

 The best way to combat viruses is to prevent them. There are several free and trusted antivirus programs available online. Your antivirus program should be running whenever your computer is connected to the internet.; , If you haven’t recently, run a virus scan on your computer. If your antivirus program gives you the option, run an in-depth scan for root kits. Schedule scans for at least once a week to prevent future virus infections.  Spyware and malware are programs that are installed behind the scenes, and can eat up valuable system resources running in the background. Windows Defender comes installed with a malware scanner, and many more are available online for free or for purchase.  

run a reputable antivirus program.  scan your computer for viruses.  perform a malware scan. 

 There are lots of different behaviors that comprise the symptoms of a sex addiction. While some of these things may have a level of social or societal norm, you may practice them outside of that norm or to such an extreme that is interferes with your life. Some examples include:Compulsive masturbation Having multiple affairs Compulsively use pornography Having unsafe or risky sex Sadistic or masochistic practices Practicing voyeurism or exhibitionism; , Addictions have traits in common, regardless of what the addiction actually is. For example, some common addiction behaviors include engaging in the behavior even though you know it causes harm, finding it difficult to stop even when you want to, experiencing some sort of withdrawal symptoms when you don’t engage (irritability, restlessness, cravings, depression), and hiding your behaviors from family and friends or minimizing them.Do you engage in any of these behaviors regarding your sexual activity? How do they affect you? How does it interfere with your daily life? To get more information and educate yourself, you may also want to look into resources on sex addiction, such as online or at your local library.  Some medical conditions can cause changes to sexuality and arousal. You may want to have a medical check-up to rule out possible factors that can affect sexuality. Some considerations include having a brain lesion, endocrine abnormalities, or side-effects from certain medications.Check with your physician whether you are at risk for any of these problems.  You might engage in risky situations which could hurt your emotional or physical health. Exposing yourself to HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can be a long-term cost to what you consider a little bit of fun. You might put yourself in dangerous situations in the pursuit of sexual pleasure such as illegal prostitution.If you know the risks yet continue to put yourself in risky situations, this might be part of an addiction.  You might feel stressed or overworked and use sex as a way to feel better. Just like drug addicts turn to drugs when life feel overwhelming, you might turn to sex. If you start to feel out of sorts or ‘off,’ you may use sex as a reset to return to normal.When you feel stressed, you might turn to sex as your first option to relieve stress over other options available to you. If you use sex as a stress reliever or if you have trouble stopping, then you may have a sex addiction.  Some people with a sex addiction have trouble experiencing true intimacy. This can include being intimate with someone on an emotional level or sexual level. You may form little attachment to your sexual partners or fail to truly connect with any love interests beyond sex.You may want to have a relationship yet not know how to connect in an intimate way beyond sex. Sex may not feel fulfilling as a form of intimacy.  You might feel as if you use sex to feel like ‘more of a man’ or ‘more of a woman.’ You might feel like you don’t know who you are without engaging in sexual activities or not have friends outside of a certain social circle that also engage the same way you do. If you take a break from sex, you might feel lost as to who you are.Outside of your sexual activity, you might have low self-esteem.  If you arrange your life around sex and obtaining your sexual desires, you might have a sex addiction. When given the opportunity to engage with friends and family or pursue sex, you may choose sex much of the time. You might prioritize sex above other things that you have to do or neglect your responsibilities in order to have sex or engage in sexual activity.If you tend to skip out people or activities to engage in sex instead, this can indicate a problem.  Many people enjoy sex and feel closer to their partners as a result of sex. Instead of feeling safe or intimate with someone as a result of sex, you might struggle with controlling your thoughts about sex or feel unable to postpone sexual feelings or actions. If sex and sexual activities take up much of your time and energy, it may be a problem.You might struggle to control thoughts or actions regarding sexual activity and feel unable to get them under control. Your thoughts may become obsessive about sex or wanting sex. Even though you may engage in sexual activity often, you may not enjoy it or find pleasure from it., It’s difficult to measure what ‘excess’ means because healthy sexuality is different depending on individual factors and life stage. For example, a person in their early 20’s may masturbate or engage in sexual activity daily and still feel and be labeled ‘healthy.’ When considering your own sexuality, ask yourself if you engage in sexual activity even when you don’t want to, or go with someone you’re not attracted to in order to fulfill your desires.You might feel powerless over how you act. If you wish you could be happier with less sex yet cannot cut back, it could indicate a problem.  If sex is affecting you negatively and you want more control over your life, consider seeing a therapist. Treatment focuses on helping you to manage your urges and desires and learning ways to engage in healthy sexuality. Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) can help you identify negative thoughts and behaviors and learn to replace them with healthy, positive ones.If you’re done struggling with a sex addiction, it’s time to seek help.   You might also consider attending an open meeting of a local Sexaholics Anonymous group to see if you can relate to what the members share and get more information on the condition. 

understand different types of sex addiction.  observe common addiction behaviors.  diagnose a medical condition.  consider if you engage in risky sexual activity.  ask yourself if you use sex to cope or feel normal.  notice if you struggle with true intimacy.  ask if your self-worth is tied to sex.  think about your priorities.  decide if sex affects you negatively.  note sexuality in excess.  see a therapist. 

 Constantly ask yourself: where is the enemy, why am I not under fire, why are my teammates not advancing and what would be the best way out of this (bad) situation. In games like Age of Empires, you should be conscious of the domestic situation (within your civilisation) and the foreign situation (outside your civilisation - i.e. with your enemy) With practice ('practice' is army-talk for 'a couple shots up your ass') this will happen automatically.   Be smart. You will get nowhere if you just run around firing blind bullets. Sure, it may get you a few kills (mostly because your opposition will not have foreseen such a stupid move) but it doesn't take a lot for the enemy to just step aside, be the calmer man and pop you with a shot to the chest. Use what devices you have available, radar (especially on Halo games!) maps showing enemy bases and above all your own eyes and the eyes of your teammates. Learn the army lingo; if someone gives you a heads-up saying '1 o'clock, AT soldier, 200’, you won't have enough time to figure out on the spot that he is talking about a soldier carrying an AT (anti-tank weapon) approaching at 1 o'clock to your current position and is currently 200 meters (656.2 ft) away. This would be pretty vital information if you were in a tank!; , In games like Operation Flashpoint, always reload your weapon when there is a natural pause in the fighting; that preparation could give you the edge in a fire-fight as you will be able to keep firing longer than your opponent without reloading. Equip yourself with a variety of weapons, short-range (shotguns, knives, sub-machine guns etc), long-range (sniper rifles, machine guns, rocket launchers etc) and other, ranged weapons, such as grenades, smoke shells, flash grenades etc. You may not always use all of the weapons, but it pays to be prepared.  Take trial runs, experiment with weapons, and put in time in the training modes. Or just simply pick a target (a lamppost, street sign or any other stationary object) in play mode and practice hitting it while moving backwards, forwards, sideways and when doing other actions (sprinting, jumping, crouching, diving, etc). Remember, a bad workman blames his tools, the same is true for soldiers, it is your choice of weapon and your skill that matters, not how ‘good’ the weapon is.   Rifles, for example, would be useless in long-range situations because of their instability when firing; they are mostly used for providing cover fire (a tactic used to get the enemy to hit the dirt by firing bullets at them but not with the intention of killing them, rather to get them to hold their fire long enough for team members to escape). This is because of their rapid-fire rate. Grenades are used to disperse enemy forces moving in groups; the fragmentation produced will wound soldiers within a certain radius.  In every mission you are given an objective, and maybe a secondary objective, make sure you have fully completed your first objective before moving onto the second objective; even then, assess the situation. If you are aware, then you will already know which members of your platoon are injured, how much ammunition you have left and how likely it is that the secondary objective will be achieved without significant loss of lives. Always go through this checklist and you will never fail:   What is my situation? Am I injured from a previous mission? Where is the nearest enemy base from my current (insertion) position and where is the nearest friendly base (in that order)? Am I part of a team? If so, what position am I in the team? A number 2 soldier has more responsibilities than a number 8 soldier, the main one being taking command of the group when number 1 goes down. What type of soldier am I? AT? LAW? Machine gunner? Rifleman? Sniper? What position should I take up in a combat situation? What should be my primary target in a combat situation – for an AT soldier it would be any tanks, for a sniper it will be any particularly well-armed soldiers, like a soldier mounting a turret, for example. What are my objective(s)? What advantages do I have over the enemy before I start? Examples are the cover of dark i.e. the element of surprise, superior numbers, a greater supply of ammunition, an extra type of soldier (e.g. AT, sniper, machine gunner, grenadier) and having vehicles (tanks, trucks, jeeps, helicopters) to hand. Of course, you will not always know so much about your enemy for you to make comparisons with yourself, war is not that easy. But it is better to ask a question and not have the answer rather than finding yourself asking the question as you stare down a gun barrel. Which of these advantages is most important to my objective and thus, which can I afford to lose should it come to sacrificing one? For example, the element of surprise would not be as important to a search and destroy mission as it would be to an ambush mission and thus the loss of surprise would be affordable in a search and destroy mission, however, the loss of the advantage of having a superior supply of ammunition, for example, would not be affordable. What will be my path to the main objective? What obstacles will I encounter on the way? Is it better if I keep a low profile and avoid any confrontations or is time too short to be sneaking out of my way? What formation will my team take (only when in command of a team, of course)? How can I use the relief (shape or lie) of the land to my advantage (cover of trees, buildings, hills etc)? What will be my objective when I encounter resistance? Destroy? RRA (Retreat, Regroup, Avoid)? Or will I decide that based upon the situation and whether or not I have achieved my objectives? If so, can I afford to decide there and then based upon the situation? These are called ROEs, Rules of Engagement, which any soldier has to know how to follow and which any commander has to know how to implement. What are my EVPs (Evasion Plan of Actions)? If you are well-prepared, then you should anticipate failure. Of course, certain things cannot be foreseen, and in those situations, the men will be separated from the boys, the seasoned veterans from the happy fairy cake newbies. If you encounter resistance and are beaten back, what will be your IEP (Initial Evasion Point)? An IEP is a location where members of your group will meet if the group has to scramble or is dispersed, from there, the EVP will be mounted. As a rule of thumb, it is always best to have 2 IEPs and EVPs.  This may seem a very odd requirement for a smart, independent soldier who wants to survive, surely thinking is the first thing he will do. Wrong. Orders are given to be followed, superiors are superiors because they have enough experience to give suitable orders. What they don’t need is puny scum soldiers trying to feed their ego by answering back or questioning. Ever wondered why discipline and respect is emphasized so much at boot camp? Because the whole point of such organisations and the drills they do is to get you to submit wholly to the order, to get you to forget your opinions, your thoughts, your fear, your emotion, such things are irrelevant, your name is irrelevant, after a few weeks in the field, no-one has a name. Having said this, the soldier is free to use his individual store of reason and judgement to ensure he survives.  

be aware.  be prepared.  know your weapons.  have a plan.  follow orders without thinking. 

 While Traditional Goth's tend to be all about the 80's music scene, Romantic Goth's focus on the dark, sensual and mysterious world of Gothic created by Victorian literature and subsequent movies. In other words they’re probably more “Gothic” than “Goth,” if that makes sense. Identifying features are velvet and lace, flowy clothes (often Victorian or Medieval inspired), and a love of poetry and literature.  It is unsurprising that Romantic Goth's are typically emotional, creative and dreamy types. Dead roses, crumbling graveyards and old skulls are things of exquisite beauty to these creatures. Preferred bands tend to be those that focus on “brooding” rather than “horror,” and so may include down tempo ethereal bands (eg. Love Spirals Downwards), and folk-ish bands (All About Eve, Faith and the Muse). The Sisters of Mercy and The Cure tend to go down well too. And of course a bit of atmospheric Classical music, especially Bach or Wagner.  Victorian fashions like corsets, lace, frock coats and pale skin are popular throughout the scene, but maybe none wear them with as much style as the Victorian Goth.  Clothes must be smart and, for many, historically accurate (corsets are to be worn beneath one’s garments, of course). Ball dress and mourning garb are particularly prominent in the scene.  This includes theatre, masquerades, tea parties and poetry. And, naturally, any kind of Dickensian or other Victorian festival that gives them an excuse to parade around in costume (not that they need an excuse).  

think dark, sensual, and mysterious.  be emotional, creative, and dreamy.  one of the biggest influences on gothic fashion has been the imagery in gothic literature and their movie counterparts, particular that of victorian writers such as edgar allen poe and bram stoker.  convey an image of decorum and dignity.  indulge in activities that were popular in victorian high society. 

 Look for hard, grey, scaly bark with deep grooves and ridges.   The ridges and furrows often mingle with flattened gray areas on the larger branches and the main trunk. The color of the bark may fluctuate somewhat between oak species, but is is nearly always a shade of gray. Some oak bark is very dark, approaching black, and some bark is nearly white.  Old-growth oaks, particularly, are distinctive for their impressive size, and in some areas (such as California's "golden hills") these behemoths dominate the landscape.   Oak trees tend to grow fairly large and round, with some reaching heights of 100 feet (30.5 m) or more. Oak trees are full and balanced, and it is not uncommon for an oak's width (including branches and foliage) to match its height. Oak trunks can be massively thick: some species commonly boast a girth of 30 feet (9.1 m) or more. Oak trees can live for more than 200 years--some have been known to live for more than 1000 years.For the most part, the thicker the trunk, the older the tree. The canopy of the oak tree tends to be relatively broad, which makes this tree a popular provider of shade and privacy during the summer months.  If a tree has been felled, cut, and split, you may need to consider characteristics like the color, the smell, and the look of the grain.   Oak is one of the hardest trees, which is why its wood is a popular choice for furniture, flooring and other household amenities. Dry oak logs are prized as firewood, as they burn slowly and thoroughly. Again, there are many species of oak, so it helps to know where the tree was felled. If you don't know where the wood came from, you may only be able to tell whether you're dealing with red or white oak. This knowledge should suffice for most non-scientific purposes. Red oak wood will have a red tint and will dry to a slightly deeper red. White oak wood will be lighter in color. Oak wood is often mixed up with maple, but you can distinguish the two by their scent. Maple has a sweeter smell--hence maple sugar--and oak has a heavier, smokier smell.  

consider the bark.  consider the size of the tree.  identify oak wood once it's been cut. 

 You need to get to a pretty tall spot, and look around for the Nether Quartz Ore. Then go to it and use your pickaxe to mine it; each ore should drop 1 Nether Quartz (more if your pickaxe is enchanted with Fortune).  4 Nether Quartz pieces put in a square in the crafting table give you 1 Block of Quartz, a whitish block. Quartz Blocks are only used for decoration; they have no unique characteristics.   A way to search for Nether Quartz Ore is to create a corridor inside the Netherrack. Every set amount of blocks, create smaller channels of 4-5 blocks to the sides of the main corridor. This exposes you to the most amount of blocks, increasing your chances of find Nether Quartz Ore.  

find nether quartz ore. nether quartz ore spawns fairly commonly in the nether, but the blocks aren't very close together.  collect a lot of nether quartz. 

 You can hang the border immediately below the ceiling or crown molding, along the top or bottom third of the wall, or halfway down a wall. Choose the location based on your preferences.; , Use soapy water to thoroughly clean the area where you want to hang the wallpaper. Make sure there is no dust, hair or other particles on the wall in that area. Allow it to dry fully before proceeding.   Remove any mildew from the walls with a mixture of 2 cups (.473 liters) bleach per 1 gallon (3.785 liter) of water. Hanging wallpaper border over mildew will cover mildew, but not kill it. If you wish, you can also sand the paint on the walls where you will hang your wallpaper. This roughens the surface and helps the wallpaper to stick but is optional.  Fill in any holes or cracks with joint compound and then sand the areas to smooth them. Clean the area of any dust after sanding by using a damp sponge.  If you are hanging along the top ceiling or crown molding then you can simply use that edge as your level.   Make sure you use a level when marking the location of a border along the middle of the wall or else you could hang the wallpaper crooked.  Use the width of your border to measure the distance between the edges. Again use a level to mark this bottom edge of your wallpaper border.  Measure the length of each wall with a measuring tape. Add these numbers together for the overall length of the walls. Read the total length each roll will cover, and divide the overall length of your walls by that number.   Be sure to buy 15 percent more than the actual area requires, because you'll need extra to match the patterns together. You must measure all four walls individually because most corners are not perfectly square.  Paint the primer along the strip where you would like to hang the wallpaper. Different primers should be applied differently so you should read the instructions from the manufacturer of your primer for specifics.   Allow it to dry but not to sit for longer than 24 hours without applying the border. Be careful not to stray outside your lines because the primer can stain the walls.  Cut a piece of wallpaper to the length you will need to cover one wall plus a little extra. When you install border wallpaper, you want to have extra paper for trimming on the ends.   Remember to measure each wall individually for accurate measurements.  Roll the wallpaper border into a loose tube shape so that the adhesive is facing outwards.  Different types of wallpaper borders will need to be prepared differently. Follow the instructions that are particular to your wallpaper. Pre-pasted wallpaper is usually the simplest option but unpasted wallpaper can also work.   Pre-pasted wallpaper usually needs to be wet, meaning you should soak it in water for no more than 30 seconds. Unpasted wallpaper will require an appropriate paste. If you are hanging the border on a painted wall then you can use a standard wallpaper paste, but if you are hanging the border on a wall with wallpaper on it already then you should use a vinyl-to-vinyl wallpaper paste. Stretch out the border wallpaper and apply the paste generously onto the backside., Pull the end of the wallpaper from the water, unrolling it from the tube as you do so. After you have pulled a few feet (or about one meter) from the water fold it back on itself with the pattern on the outside. Continue this, always bringing the adhesive sides together until you have several folds together as if in an accordion.   Be careful to be gentle; you do not want to crease the corners.  Booking the wallpaper border into an accordion shape keeps the paper moist so that it soaks up the liquid and activates the adhesive. You must allow the border to sit for a few minutes to allow the paper to relax and expand., You will want to start with the wall that contains the least visible corner of the room. Later on the wallpapers may meet up in a visible seam at this corner so choose a corner that is the least visible.   Alternatively you can start at the edge of the entry door to prevent there being any uneven seams at all., Starting in the least visible corner unfold one end of the wallpaper and apply it to the wall. You want the edge of the wallpaper to cover the corner and go into the next wall by at least ½ inch (1 cm).   If you have a line drawn on the wall then the wallpaper border should just barely cover the upper line. If you are applying the wallpaper just below the ceiling then you should use the edge of the ceiling to align the wallpaper border.  This will smooth out wrinkles and bubbles and make the wallpaper lie flat. Be careful as you smooth down the wallpaper because it can rotate slightly and become unaligned. Continuously check that you border stays aligned with the ceiling or level along the wall.  Keep hanging the wallpaper border until you reach the end of the wall and your piece of wallpaper. The wallpaper should extend completely into the corner and onto the next wall.   Trim the excess wallpaper on the next wall to ¼ inch (6 mm) using a sharp knife or razor and a straight edge. Line up something hard and straight along the edge of the wallpaper and drag the razor down the edge.  Measure the next wall and cut the next piece of wallpaper border so that it will match up with the pattern on the first strip with a little bit of overlap. Cut the border wallpaper to the length of the wall, reverse roll it, put it in water for a short time and let it sit to absorb the moisture and expand and relax.   To install border wallpaper, you need to align the patterns up so no one will notice a break in the design. This is why you must choose where you cut your piece of wallpaper for the next wall.  Overlap the ¼ inch (6 mm) of the first strip on the wall and continue hanging the border on the wall. Remember to keep it level as you hang it. Smooth it out with the wallpaper brush until the end of the piece of wallpaper. Push this border into the corner and into the next wall at the end of the strip.  Remove the overlap at the first corner where you put the new strip of wallpaper over the top of the first piece of wallpaper. Take a razor and cut through the upper layer directly at the edge of the border wallpaper so that the two edges line up perfectly.   When hanging wallpaper border, you want nice, clean edges that match perfectly with each other.  Continue with the following strips of wallpaper border until you have finished all the walls of the room. Use the same processes for each of the following strips of wallpaper, making sure you remove all the bubbles and making the seams clean and sharp.  As you hang the wallpaper around the walls you should remove any excess glue along the edges of the border. Use a damp sponge to gently wash away this excess.  

decide where you want to hang your border.  clean the area where you want to hang your wallpaper.  fix any imperfections.  use a measuring tape, level and pencil to mark the top edge of where you want your border to hang.  mark the bottom edge of where you want your border to hang.  calculate how many rolls of border you'll need to hang wallpaper trim.  paint a wallpaper primer-sealer onto the wall.  cut a strip of border the length of one wall plus 3-4 inches (7.5-10 cm) with scissors.  reverse roll the wallpaper.  follow the manufacturer's directions to prepare the strip.  book the wallpaper.  allow the border to sit for five minutes.  start in the most least visible corner of the room.  apply the strip of wallpaper to the wall.  flatten the strip down with a wallpaper brush.  continue to unfold the border and smooth it into the wall until you reach the end of the piece.  prepare the next strip of wallpaper.  install the next strip of wallpaper.  double cut the overlap with a sharp razor blade.  continue this process until you have finished wallpapering the room.  wipe off any excess glue. 

 If you want to pose like a model, do not look directly into the camera. When posing as a model, you'll rarely be striking a pose where your head is pointed directly at the camera. You'll usually have your face turned away slightly. Therefore, it can look unnatural to have your eyes pointed at the camera.It's a good rule of thumb to follow your nose with your eyes. Look straight out over your nose. This will make your gaze look natural.Many people feel they look somewhat bug-eyed when gazing directly at the camera, especially if their head is turned to the side. You also may feel more self conscious when staring at the camera, which can affect your expression in subtle, unconscious ways.; , If you raise your chin forward slightly, and then tip it downward, this elongates your neck and makes your jawline more pronounced. This can be a slimming look that highlights your facial features.         However, if you're posing from a side profile, this method can make you look like a turtle poking its head out of its shell. Hold your head in a more natural position for side profile shots., If you don't plan on smiling in a photo, open your mouth slightly. This is a small change, but one that can completely alter the feel of a photograph. If your mouth is closed, your jawline can clench. The expression can also look bored and neutral. Opening your mouth gives the picture an intimate, inviting feel.You do not need to open your mouth too much. This can look forced or unnatural. Just open your mouth slightly, parting your lips by less than a centimeter. The effect will be subtle, but can change the tone of a photo drastically. If you choose to smile for a picture instead, go for a natural smile. Try to think of a happy moment or funny memory to try and provoke a smile.  It's important you look as slim and stretched out as possible in a model photograph. Therefore, try to elongate your neck when the picture is being taken. Depending on the angle, your neck can easily look smaller and shorter than normal on camera. Stretching your neck outward can prevent this problem.Before the picture is taken, raise your head upward. You may even want to turn your face up slightly. If you're looking to the side in a picture, try looking up a little. This can stretch your neck out, creating a slimming appearance.  

look away from the camera.  keep your chin forward and down.  try an open mouthed look.  elongate your neck. 

 If you want to stay home but avoid a trip to the doctor, you have to choose a sickness that’s not too severe. You'll have to feign an illness that can only be cured by staying at home and avoiding any hard work, (like going to school)! A stomach virus is a good choice because it leaves you unable to go to class but isn’t necessarily severe enough to call for medical attention. The most awful symptoms of a stomach virus include diarrhea, vomiting and cramps.A fever also works because it makes a good excuse to stay home but usually just requires a little rest and relaxation. Fever signs and symptoms might include sweating, shivering, headache, muscle aches, loss of appetite, dehydration and general weakness. ; , People don’t generally get sick all of a sudden, so you'll have to begin feeling bad the day before you want to stay home and let your guardians know about it.   Tell your guardians that you’re not feeling your best. You can do this by saying some key phrases like:  "My head hurts.” "I ate something funny at lunch today." "A lot of my classmates have been out sick lately, I hope I didn't catch anything!"    , If you want to stay home without going to the doctor, you have to convey that you’re sick but not sick enough to need medical care.   Avoid suddenly showing all of your symptoms at once. Pretending to vomit may make your guardians concerned enough to bring you to the doctor, so it’s best to stick to feigning the other two symptoms. Avoid showing only the symptoms that you know your guardians usually treat with medication, like a headache.  At this point in your performance, you’re just starting to feel sick and need to be subtle or else risk being figured out.   The “art” of your performance lies in subtlety revealing your ailments. To help you find the right balance, think about what happened the last time you started to get sick. Avoid using direct phrases such as:  “I don’t think I’ll be able to go to school tomorrow.” ”I’m not feeling well enough to make it to class.” ”I’m too sick for school.”    , Don’t engage in the normal activities you would do if you felt well to show that you’re not feeling your best.   Decline to participate in a favorite activity, such as watching a movie or playing a board game. Seem disinterested in engaging in the things your guardians know you usually enjoy doing. Contribute little to the conversation, so that you seem too tired to be involved. If your parents ask if you’ve been feeling sick for a while, tell them that you’ve been feeling slightly off all day.  If your stomach really hurt, eating a big meal is the last thing you want to do! If you had a fever, you could be experiencing a loss of appetite, which also would make you not want to eat much.   Excuse yourself to use the bathroom and don’t come out for ten minutes to give the impression that you are feeling bad but that you can still function enough to not raise too much concern. When you return to the table, let your guardians know that your stomach is hurting by saying things like:  ”Sorry I was gone for so long, my stomach feels really weird.” ”I’m not sure if I can finish dinner, my stomach really doesn’t feel well.” ”Can I be excused? My stomach is hurting and I think I want to lay down for a moment.”   If possible, sneak some snacks into your bedroom to eat later so that you don’t get really hungry at night!  , Generally, being sick is really taxing on your body! Your body works hard to fight off stomach viruses and other fever-causing ailments so you'll need to show your guardians that your body is hard at work because you're "really" sick.   Some well-known symptoms of a fever include body aches, fatigue and muscle weakness. You can show that your tired by moving slower than normal, laying down on the couch or resting your head on the table at dinner. When you’re tired, your body temperature may drop slightly causing you to feel colder than normal. Get a blanket that’s heavier than normal to put over yourself when you’re sitting on the couch. , If you know that your guardians will want to touch your face or use a thermometer to check for a fever, you first need to elevate your body temperature.   A fever is also known as a “high temperature.” You have a fever when your temperature rises above its normal range, which is about 98.6 F (37 C). Depending on what's causing your fever, additional fever signs and symptoms might include:  Sweating Shivering Headache Muscle aches Loss of appetite Dehydration General weakness Pretending you have an increased body temperature should be done by demonstrating that you have the symptoms of a fever and by showing that you have above-average body temperature.  You want your face looks red and to feel hot to the touch.   Put on a sweater or heavy clothing to begin making your body warm. Without anyone seeing, do jumping jacks, high-knees, or mountain-climbers for one minute. If you’re not hot after one minute, repeat your method until you start to feel hot and sweaty. Don’t overdo it! You don’t want to push yourself too hard and risk injury. Be careful and only perform until you feel hot. Take off your added layer of clothing and immediately go to your guardians and say you don’t feel well. They will see that you’re sweating and if they touch your cheek, they will feel that you’re hot.  If you show that you’re consistently warm, your guardians will be more likely to believe you’re sick.   Run a cloth under hot water and put it on your face and neck when no one is looking. Be sure that the water isn’t too hot, because you risk burning yourself. Pat off the excess water with a dry towel. You want to seem warm and have a little bit of water remaining. This will make it look like you’ve been sweating. If you don’t have access to a cloth, rub your face with your hands. This will create friction and warm your face quickly, as well as make it red. Ask your guardians to feel your head or cheek. Once you’ve warmed up, tell your guardians you don’t feel good again and let them touch your hot forehead.  If you know your guardians will want to measure your temperature, you’ll have to plan ahead to make the thermometer hot to show your temperature is elevated.   Rub the tip of the thermometer with your fingers. The faster you move your fingers, the faster the thermometer will heat up to the temperature you want. If you have a heat source nearby, like a light bulb, put the thermometer next to it for a few moments. If your thermometer is one with mercury inside, then you can also raise the temperature by soaking it in hot water. Make sure that the water isn't boiling hot, as this could cause the mercury thermometer to explode. The water temperature should only be a few degrees hotter than your body temperature, around 99.5F. , Like any actor, you'll need some props to show your guardians that your symptoms are persistent and aren’t going away.Hide a cup of water somewhere by your bed. This will be used at night to really convince your guardians that you are sweating. If you have an electric tea kettle that won’t be noticed if missing, that’s even better than a cup of water. This way, you will be able to show that you’re both hot and sweating. Get a face cloth to hide by your bed next to the water. The cloth will be used to apply the water and also to make your face red.  Wake yourself up In the middle of the night to show your guardians that you still have symptoms.   Around 2AM or 3AM is a good time to wake up. Use the cloth and water that you hid by your bed to rub your face until it looks red. Don’t dry your face completely, so that it is still slightly wet and will look like sweat. Walk into your guardian's room and ask them to feel your head because you think you might be sick.  If you complain about feeling extremely sick now your guardians might strongly consider taking you to the doctor.   If your guardians come to sit with you at night, wait a few minutes before pretending to fall asleep. Tell them you feel thirsty and ask for water. Pull the sheets tight over you to show that you’re cold. Avoid talking or complaining too much: let your performance speak for itself!  , If you stay in bed, your guardians will be more likely to think that you’re tired and simply need to sleep. If they believe you need rest, you’ll be able to avoid both school and the doctor.   If your guardians come to wake you up, try to rub your face with your hands before they come into your room to make your face red and hot. Tell your guardians that you couldn’t sleep much. Say you now you’re even more exhausted than you were yesterday.  Continue “showing” your symptoms during breakfast or else your guardians will know you don’t want to go to school.   Eat little at breakfast to show your still not feeling well. Wear a heavy sweater and ask for an extra blanket because you “feel” really cold. Lay your head on the table to show that you’re really tired and disinterested  , 

pick the right ailment.  complain about the ailment.  don’t overly stress your performance!,  plant the idea that you might need to stay home the following day without being overly dramatic.  alter your afternoon routine.  don’t eat much at the dinner table.  feign tiredness.  feign a temperature increase.  increase your body temperature.  make your face red and your neck hot whenever possible.  ”trick” the thermometer.  gather supplies.  set your alarm.  don’t perform too much!,  stay in bed late in the morning.  don’t fizzle out.  if you followed these steps closely and your parents seem to buy into your story, ask them if you can stay home for the day!  

 Because smoke alarms can be so finicky and are not optimal in every are of your home, it’s a good idea to consider alternative methods to detecting smoke or fire. This can help ensure that your home is fully protected from fire or smoke and may minimize the number of unpleasant false alarms.   Most fire alarms in the United States fall into two categories: photoelectric and ionization models. Ionization models are better at detecting flaming fires, while photoelectric models react more quickly to smoldering fires. Although most homes have ionization models, most experts consider the photoelectric detector to be more effective.You can get dual models that may minimize false alarms., Technological developments have produced smoke alarms that are wireless and can alert every one in the house if there is smoke present. Purchase wireless alarms to prevent nuisance alarms and help avoid problems with power sources.Wireless alarms are especially useful for multi-level homes., Some new thermostats are “smart” and include heat detectors that can sense significant changes in temperature that may indicate a fire. Position this type of detector in areas that experience shifts in temperature or humidity.The heat detector is useful in rooms such as the kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room.Some heat detectors will allow you to turn off the alarm with a wave of your hand., Carbon monoxide is a dangerous and colorless gas that can kill you. Although it doesn’t cause fires, carbon monoxide, or CO, is often near places where there are fires. Consider employing a carbon monoxide detector in your home to help prevent death or potentially detect conditions rife for fire.Consider purchasing a combination CO/ smoke detector., There are many things, such as dust or weather, that can affect the air quality in your home and either set off false smoke alarms or cause fires. Watching the air quality in your home may help prevent false alarms and buildup of chemicals or gases that can cause fires.Most indoor air quality monitors test for temperature, relatively humidity, and carbon dioxide, or CO2., They can provide information on where devices should be located, what type of devices to use in each location, and even come to your house to perform an inspection. 

consider dual fire detectors.  invest in wireless alarms.  use a heat detector.  employ a carbon monoxide alarm.  monitor indoor air quality.  contact your local fire department to ensure your home is up to code.

 Regulations regarding basement apartment requirements vary between jurisdictions, but it is very common that a separate entrance is required. This ensures ease of access but also serves as a method of emergency egress in case of a fire. If your basement already has a door to the outside, this requirement is likely fulfilled.; , Many building codes require separate dwellings to have a certain amount of natural light. Whether or not your unit has adequate sunlight can be tested by a local building inspector using special equipment. If you can't pass this requirement, you will have to have additional windows installed along an exterior wall in order to create a legal basement apartment.  Another major requirement concerns the amount of insulation between your main dwelling and the basement unit. You will almost certainly have to replace the door to the stairway separating the units with a fire door; these doors are usually made from steel and can withstand a burn for 2 hours or more before giving way. Additional insulation for soundproofing and fire resistance may also be required in the floor between the units. If your basement is currently unfinished, adding this insulation will be easy.  

make sure that the basement apartment has a dedicated exit.  ensure that the basement has enough light.  improve the sound and fire insulation between dwellings.

Color - It is a myth that all diamonds are colorless. While most diamonds appear white, all include trace amounts of yellow. Colorless diamonds typically hold the most value, with nearly colorless following suit. However, deeply colored fancy diamonds can sometimes cost more than colorless diamonds of the same carat weight. Fancy diamonds are popular in many celebrity engagement rings and come in a variety of colors, such as pink, grey, yellow and orange.  Carat - Diamond size is measured by weight in carats. Prices rise as carat weight increases. Choosing a slightly smaller carat weight, can save you money and still allow you to present your future spouse with a dazzling diamond.  Clarity - Most diamonds have tiny flaws called inclusions, often invisible to the naked eye. Pay special attention to product details when deciding. Most diamonds do contain some blemishes inside the stones and these are what give each diamond its own uniqueness. The most important thing to remember about clarity is that you do not want inclusions to be visible to the naked eye, nor should they be so excessive that they affect the diamond's brilliance or durability.  Clarity is a critical C and has a great effect on the diamond's value. When diamonds are moved up on the clarity scale, you generally see a significant increase in price. The object is to choose a diamond as high on the clarity scale as your budget will allow, while still taking the other C's into account.    Cut - The cut of a diamond determines how well a diamond reflects light to shows its brilliance. A standard report describes cut by the shape or outline of the diamond and the facet arrangement, also known as cutting style. Shapes range from traditional round to hearts, pears, emerald, and more. Choose a shape that reflects the tastes of the person who will wear the stone. Cut becomes very relevant when zeroing down on the choice of diamond. The cut is the result of transforming the diamond into a gem. A better cut will have a great effect on the beauty of the diamond. Diamonds with correct proportions better refract the light out of the top of the stone. Lesser cut diamonds allow some light to escape from the bottom of the stone, resulting in a less brilliant diamond.  Shape - Another factor you need to consider when choosing a diamond is its shape. Although shape and cut are sometimes used interchangeably, they are not the same. Cut refers to the proportions and symmetry. Shape, on the other hand, refers to the actual shape or contour of the diamond. There are 8 popular shapes including: round (also called brilliant cut), Princess cut, Emerald cut, Asscher cut, Marquise cut, Radiant cut, Pear cut, and Heart cut. When you select a shape, the most important factor is simply what appeals to you.  Before purchasing, check if the diamonds are certified or not. Some of the most accurate/popular diamond grading labs include Precision Gem Grading Laboratory (PGGL), Gemological Institute of America (GIA), European Gemological Laboratory (EGL), and International Gemological Institute (IGI).

 It is built with poles that are 4 x 4-inches (10.16 x 10.16 cm). These protected posts, or utility poles, are set in a grid 8 feet (2.44 meters) apart.; ,   The barn, depending on your location, can be enclosed on 3 sides (or with half of the front covered). Another choice is to open it on the side, facing the sun in winter. This way you will have prevailing winds for summer cooling of the horse. Make the roof from fiberglass or sheet metal. Both of these come in varying lengths and are 26 inches (10.14 cm) wide. The wall cladding is the same material used for the roof.  Make sure you keep the posts square to each other when you lay out the post locations. Remember, it is in 8-foot (2.44 meter) grids. You will need 6 post locations for an 8 x 16-foot (2.44 x 4.88-meter) shed.  61 to 1.22 meters) deep and 1 foot (. 3 meters) wide. Opt for the measurements to be 4 feet (1.22 meters) deep if your climate has a lot of freeze and thaw cycles. Moderate climates require 2 feet (. 61 meters).  Pour a premixed sack of concrete into the hole around the post, up at least 1 foot (. 3 meters). Wait a couple of days for the concrete to set and then backfill the remainder of the way with dirt dug from the holes.  Keep checking as you go to ensure your post is square. Use a string line run on the back and front to keep the center post in-line.  Run a skirt board on one side of the front if the ban is to be closed off. This is usually an 8-foot (2.44 meters) section of the front.   Use 2 x 4-inch (5.08 x 10.16 cm) wood grits, or lattice board, 2 feet (. 61 meters) apart from the bottom of the skirt board to the top of the wall on 3 sides. Opt for 2 x 6-inch (5.08 x 15.24 cm) treated wood board all around the outside of the pole barn for the roof frame to sit on the top grit. Set the stringer top edge (on the side wall section) 6 feet (1.83 meters) from the ground. Now raise the front end up to the 8-foot (2.44 meters) mark on the front. Cut the post off flush with the roof stringers. , Nail the 2 x 4-inch (5.08 x 10.16 cm) wood flat on 1 end. ,   The holes are pre-drilled and use special #12 2-inch (2.12 cm) metallic steel hex drill-point roofing screws. Cut to fit using a circular saw fitted with a metal cutoff blade on the sloped sides.  Add doors to the front, if needed, by building a 2 x 4-foot (. 61 x 1.22-meter) frame. Use the same sheet metal as the roof and walls, and hang it from the post.  

understand that building a pole barn is straight forward and pretty much as simple as it gets.  build an 8 x 16-foot (2.44 x 4.88 meters) structure with a shed roof that is 8 feet (2.44 meters) high in the front and 6 feet (1.83 meters) tall in the back.  start building the pole barn by laying out the location of the posts on the ground that drains well and is relatively flat.  dig the post holes a minimum of 2 to 4 feet (.  set the treated 4 x 4-inch (10.16 x 10.16 cm) wood posts into place, bracing them to keep them plumb.  tamp down the dirt as you backfill.  attach a treated 2 x 6-inch (5.08 x 15.24 cm) wood skirt board around the bottom of the back and sides of the pole barn if you have it open in the front.  add another 2 x 4-inch (5.08 x 10.16 cm) grit on the side level with the one you placed against the bottom of the stringer at the back.  ,  use 2 x 6-inch (5.08 x 15.24 cm) wood for the roof rafters that sit on 4-foot (1.22-meter) centers.  fasten metal hurricane hold-down straps to the posts and to the rafters to prevent high wind gusts from pulling the roof off of the support posts.  ,  overlap 29-gauge galvanized corrugated roofing panel by 2 inches (2.12 cm) to the skirt board, stringers and grits.  finish with preformed foam sealer strips that fit between the roofing and joist.

 Before you begin seriously considering whether you want to follow this career path, read up on the wedding industry.   In the United States the wedding industry is a huge economic force: every year people spend $165 billion on 2.4 million weddings. ; , Although there is a huge market for wedding planners to capture, it’s good to acquaint yourself with what it will require of you to be a good wedding planner.   It offers a lot of flexibility and control over your time.You’ll work non-conventional hours. Your clients will likely work 9-to-5 jobs, meaning you'll be meeting with them in the evening and on weekends. Since most weddings take place on Saturdays, you’ll work lots of weekends. , Planning weddings is a highly competitive business and comes with many demands in addition to benefits.   It requires a wide array of knowledge. You’ll need to know how to manage a successful business, pick good suppliers, navigate through one "crisis" after another, and work with inevitable interpersonal dynamics. In spite of everything, it can be extremely rewarding. Taking part in someone’s special day is very satisfying, but it's every bit as demanding as it is rewarding. Weddings are always very emotional. You’ll deal with easy-going family members and vendors, but you'll also encounter the occasional bridezilla and micro-managing mothers and friends. It’s physically demanding. You’ll be on your feet for 10-to-15 hours during the wedding. You may have to lift and move furniture and boxes. You may have to help a drunk guest to a chair. , It takes 2-to-4 years to reach profitability. It will take some time to build your client base and accumulate experience and references, all required to be profitable. , After you have learned some of the basic facts of the wedding industry and being a wedding planner, think about whether pursuing this career path is right for you and your lifestyle.   Are you able to handle the physical demands? Do you like your weekends free? Can you be available for your clients at all times, in some cases even when you’re on vacation?  , Client and vendor management is a significant part of the job.   Can you handle the emotional demands? Are you able to deal positively with all sorts of people? Are you shy or extroverted? You’ll need to be able to interact constructively with almost anyone. , The range in income for wedding planners is anywhere from $15,000 a year to more than $100,000 a year, depending your reputation, how you advertise, where your business is located, and the types of services you offer. , Once you’ve weighed the pros and cons of the very rewarding and demanding landscape of being a wedding planner, you can make a decision about continuing on this career path.  As you slowly start to establish your business, consider the professional and personal experiences you can apply to your new career path.   Do you have experience in event planning? Maybe you excel at throwing birthday and dinner parties. This is experience you can apply to being a wedding planner. If you don’t have any real experience in planning events, you’ll likely want to get some education and experience under your belt before you start planning weddings full-time.  Although there is no formal certification required to be a wedding planner, having some practical knowledge of the business can improve your chances of success. There are many options for education as a wedding planner. You can take online courses or classes at a local college. Wedding conferences and expos may also offer some form of training that could provide you with certification.  Having a certificate showing that you’ve completed a course in wedding planning or joined an association of professional wedding planners will help legitimize you and your business in the eyes of potential clients.   Both the American Association of Certified Wedding Planners and The Association of Bridal Consultants offer certifications. , Reading wedding industry publications like Brides magazine as well as popular books and magazines such as Martha Stewart Weddings will give you good pointers on wedding trends, successful wedding plans, and etiquette conventions.   It’s a good idea to read business publications, too. These will help you think about your own business structure and how to make it successful.  These events will further your knowledge of wedding trends as well as successful business models.   They’ll also give you the chance to network with other wedding planners.  Observing the weddings of family members and friends will give you ideas on what -- and what not -- to do in planning a successful wedding.   Use such occasions to network casually with potential clients and vendors. Just don't let networking diminish the occasion: you're there mainly to celebrate the newly married couple.  Having hands-on experience with wedding planning will give you practical knowledge that you can use for your business. You’re likely to get references from colleagues and suggestions for clients as well.  This will supplement any formal knowledge you have and give you practical experience working in the field.   Your boss can also act as a reference for you with potential clients. Internships are often unpaid. The experience you gain will be more valuable than a paycheck. Your boss could wind up a long-term mentor as you rise through the profession. It might be useful to take a job with a smaller company at first. This will give you the chance to work in all aspects of wedding planning and greatly increase your knowledge.  This will give you the valuable hands-on experience you need -- to say nothing of the chance to prospect for clients at the same time. Use these friends and family members as references.   Be sure to take photos of any event you work on for your portfolio and future marketing efforts. Use these images on your website or in brochures. , Having a list of people whom you can ask questions, draw upon for services, or who are interested in hiring you will put your business on the path to success even in its infancy.   You can meet appropriate people almost anywhere, especially at industry conferences, wedding expos, vendor shops, and, of course, at weddings. Never stop practicing interpersonal skills as you develop your network.  You’ll need to be a legal entity to legitimize your business. Formalizing a business structure, developing a marketing strategy, and establishing a billing structure will show potential clients that you are a serious businessperson.   If you have any questions, consult the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), which was set up to help smaller companies. , The SBA and local authorities can help you if you have any questions. Setting up your business with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is also important. , This is an important step as you develop your business. Make these plans flexible to accommodate any contingency (such as illness or a lawsuit).  Having an experienced mentor who knows the ins and outs of the wedding and wedding-planning industries will help you grow your business.   This person can offer invaluable advice on pricing, dealing with difficult clients or vendors, and how to hire staff.  Wedding planners often offer services beyond overseeing the details of weddings. Perhaps you would like to help plan the bride’s shower or the newly married couple’s honeymoon.   If you decide to offer additional services, you’ll need to make sure you’re aware of the latest trends in those areas. You can find this kind of information in the same trade publications mentioned above.  Think about how much you want to charge for your services. Knowing this information in advance will make you appear more professional when you meet with potential clients.   Asking other wedding planners or inquiring what other companies charge will give you a point of reference. Make sure your prices are commensurate with your experience and your location. Weddings in Buffalo don’t cost as much as they do in New York City.  Once you know your price structure, you can think about how to invoice your customers and the types of payment you will accept.   Have a separate bank account for your business from the one you use for personal finances. Have separate credit lines, too.  Maintaining fair business practices is vital to your success.  This will be one of many calling cards you can show potential and actual clients. It will also help vendors better meet your needs.   Having something that distinguishes you from other planners will attract clients to your business. Take pictures of any wedding-planning activities you do, and consistently update them. Offer different styles of weddings for the wide array of tastes and budgets people will have.  Successful advertising will help you attract clients and build your professional network.Using print media -- brochures, a website, or ads in publications -- is one way to market yourself. Appearing at wedding conventions is another way to market your services. Getting involved in community activities is a type of free marketing. Donating a service or making a contribution to charity sends a message to the public you want to serve.  In the early stages you may be the only person on staff. You simply may not be able to afford to hire anyone.   If you decide to hire help, you’ll look for someone who's professional, experienced with weddings, and can help you grow your business.  They will grow as you gather experience. It’s important to continue making new contacts. Your success depends on it.   Consider partnering with other businesses to benefit each other. Use several different vendors for a given service. If you run into an emergency or have a bad experience with one company, you can turn to others.  Weddings are a very trendy business. Being aware of current trends and continuously accumulating all types of pertinent knowledge is important to your continued success.   The best ways to continue your education are the same as when you first started out: read trade publications, attend weddings, and network with other wedding planners.  You’ve taken the steps to be a wedding planner. Remember to enjoy the chance to be part of a couple's special day.

 This is a cover for the dial which sets your shutter speed or aperture. Slide it down to uncover the dial. This is the single most important control on the camera, so play with the dial a little to get the feel of it. ("AT dial" is a hideous term from Canon's literature, borrowed here for lack of a better one, sorry.), The A-1 has three modes that you'll be interested in: fully-programmed AE (which is fully automatic), shutter-priority AE, aperture-priority AE and fully manual.      Turn your mode dial to "Tv" and the shutter speed to "P" for program automatic.  Programmed AE will make the camera set both aperture and shutter speeds for you automatically. Turn your mode dial to "Tv" ("Time value", which is Canon's silly name for "shutter priority"), and use your AT dial to select the green "P" as the shutter speed. Most of the time, this will be what you want to use if you're not using your aperture for creative depth of field tricks, or if you're not using your shutter speed to creative effect; it generally does a good job of picking something that works for most photos most of the time. (Sorry, but this is 1978; you can't shift the program.)      For shutter-priority auto-exposure, turn the mode dial to "Tv" and select your shutter speed (here, 1/125 sec).  Shutter-priority AE will allow you to select a shutter speed, and then the A-1 will pick an aperture for you. If you want either very fast or very slow shutter speeds for creative effect, then use this. Turn your mode dial to "Tv" and select a shutter speed. Remember that the speeds in yellow on the dial are shutter speeds in seconds, the white numbers are ones in fractions of a second.      For aperture-priority auto-exposure, turn the mode dial to "Av" and select your aperture.  Aperture-priority AE will allow you to select an aperture, and then the A-1 will select a shutter speed for you. Use this if you want to use very wide or very small apertures (i.e. if you want creative control over depth of field). Turn your mode dial to "Av" and select an aperture with the AT dial to get aperture priority AE. Note that this won't allow you to select apertures smaller than f/22, but you shouldn't be doing that anyway. Fully manual exposure is a last resort for using in extremely dimor otherwise impossible lighting conditions. You can select fully manual mode by setting your mode dial to "Tv", selecting a shutter speed, and turning your aperture ring on your lens off "A" and to your preferred aperture. You'll need an external light meter for doing this; the A-1 shows no indication of over- and under-exposure in fully manual mode.  Your shutter speed and your aperture (either the shutter or the aperture or both or none could be automatically selected) will be displayed in the viewfinder. If either the shutter speed or aperture readouts are blinking, it means you've selected a shutter speed that is either too fast or slow for the largest or smallest apertures on your camera, or an aperture that requires a shutter speed faster or slower than the camera has available.Select a different aperture or shutter speed if this is the case., The A-1 provides you with two useful focusing aids to ensure that your shots are sharp. One is a split image, right in the center, which splits the images into two pieces, which are aligned when the image is in focus. The other (more useful) aid is a microprism ring around the outside of the the split screen. this will cause any defocus to be far more obvious than it would be otherwise; when it's out of focus, this area will flicker and display a very obvious "cross-hatched" pattern. Turn the focus ring until either the split image is no longer visibly split, or until the image in the microprism ring is visibly sharp., This feature of the A-1 forces the camera to either under- or over-expose your shot by a given amount. You'll need this in tricky, inconsistent lighting conditions. Press the button to unlock the exposure compensation dial and turn it to give you the desired amount (you can do this in 1/3 stop increments). Turning this clockwise will give you underexposure, and counter-clockwise will give you overexposure. Actually, the A-1's exposure compensation dial is annoying and difficult to do one-handed, so you might not want to bother with this. The ASA dial, on the other hand, can be changed with a fingertip. Neither the ASA nor exposure compensation dials will give you any indication (other than by looking at them) that you're forcibly over- or under-exposing, and the ASA dial has the advantage of being much easier to use. It's up to you., The viewfinder will temporarily blank out and the shutter will fire. If you're using one of the optional power winders, the film will advance itself to the next frame, otherwise, wind it on yourself. Keep photographing until you get to the last frame. Don't pay any attention to the frame counter; you're only at the end of the roll when the winder becomes difficult-to-impossible to wind on (don't force it!), or when your power winder (if you have one) refuses to wind it on any further. 

uncover your at dial.  set your exposure mode.  look through the viewfinder and very gently half-press the shutter button.  focus.  set exposure compensation, if required.  press your shutter button. 

 You won't be able to find Latias until after you have defeated the Elite Four and become the Champion. Click here for tips on defeating the Elite Four.; , After the credits complete, you'll be taken back to your room. Go downstairs and watch the television. You'll receive a message that a red flying Pokémon has been spotted. This is Latias.  You'll be doing a lot of walking while looking for Latias, so it's highly recommended that you stock up on Max Repels. These items will keep wild Pokémon from attacking if they are lower-level than your lead Pokémon.   If you've already used your Master Ball, you'll need lots of Ultra Balls.  Latias is incredibly fast, and will run at the first opportunity. You'll need a Pokémon that will be fast enough to act first, as well as have an ability that can keep Latias trapped. This isn't as important if you have a Master Ball.   A Level 35-39 Wobbuffet is one of the most popular lead Pokémon due to its Shadow Tag ability. This will keep Latias from escaping, and you can swap out to one of your fighters. Another popular choice is a Level 39 Golbat with the Mean Look ability. The Golbat will usually be able to act first, and the Mean Look ability will keep Latias from running. Give your starting Pokémon the Quick Claw. This will increase the chances that you will have the first attack.  One of the best moves for lowering a Pokémon's health without knocking it out is False Swipe. This will damage the opposing Pokémon, but will not lower its health below 1. This makes the Pokémon much easier to capture.   If you're using the Master Ball, you don't need to worry about lowering Latias's health.  If you have a friend with Latias, trade with them and then trade the Latias back. Adding Latias to your Pokedex will allow you to track it on the map, making it easier to find.  Latias appears at random around Hoenn, and changes locations every time you enter a building or move to a different area. You can speed up the hunt by finding a place that allows you to fight and change locations quickly. A popular spot is the tall grass outside of the Safari Zone.  If your lead Pokémon is Level 39, the Max Repel will keep all Pokémon Level 39 and lower from attacking you. Since Latias is Level 40, this increases the chances that you'll face Latias in a battle (if it's in the area)., If it is not Latias, either defeat the Pokémon or flee. Repeat this until you've either encountered about 10-20 Pokémon. If after that many encounters you still haven't seen Latias, there's a good chance that it's not in your area.  Latias will move to another random area in Hoenn. Enter the tall grass and start trying to find Latias again., You don't need to move to different areas, you just need to keep resetting Latias's position until it is in your area. Eventually you will encounter Latias.  Your Master Ball will make quick work of Latias, allowing you to capture it immediately. If you don't have a Master Ball, you'll need to lower Latias's health before capturing it.  This will allow you to then switch to a heavy-hitting Pokémon to start taking down Latias's health.  You can increase your chances if you can put Latias to Sleep or Paralyze it. You'll likely have to throw multiple Ultra Balls before Latias is captured.  There's a good chance that Latias will run when you fight it for the first time. Luckily, you're given a few advantages for finding it again. First, Latias's location will be shown on your map after you've encountered it once. Second, Latias will not regenerate health between fights, meaning if you lowered its health significantly the first time, you don't have to worry about doing it again.  Walk around in the tall grass using Max Repels until you encounter it. Repeat this process until you've captured Latias.  

defeat the elite four.  watch the credits and then go downstairs.  gather your supplies.  get the right pokémon to lead your party.  get a few pokémon that can take latias's health down.  trade with a friend for a boost (optional).  find a location that lets you enter tall grass and quickly change locations.  use a max repel.  start walking through the tall grass until a battle starts.  enter a building and exit again to make latias move.  repeat this until you encounter latias.  throw your master ball immediately (if you have one).  use mean look to keep latias from running.  start throwing ultra balls once latias is nearly knocked out.  track latias down if it escapes.  travel to the location that latias is marked. 

 Many people take insurance for granted, but if they see danger or potential hazard in their future, they’re more likely to consider buying insurance. Insurance doesn’t even have to be mentioned.They should be prompted with a question related to their situation, as well as the insurance you're attempting to sell.   Potential house insurance questions:  What’s the most valuable thing you have in your house? Have the recent floods been anywhere near your house?   Potential life insurance questions:  How long do you think your savings would work for your family if you passed?  Are you aware funerals can cost nearly $10,000?!Potential disability insurance questions:  Could you continue your physically demanding job if you were permanently injured? If you get injured and can't work for a long period of time, can your spouse's salary support you?    , View things from their perspective to understand their problems and deliver possible solutions. Unique insurance ideas targeted directly at your customers’ needs shows your passion for learning about them. Being their friends could help lead to a more lucrative connection.Did your clients just have a child for whom they might want life insurance? Have they recently thought about a travel trailer or camper? Are they really into boats and jet-skis? If so, you could insure the vehicles as well as review some health insurance options.  Re-examine their coverage and use this as an opportunity to up-sell. You may find new reasons they are unsatisfied with current coverage, or ways to combine coverage currently not under your purview. Some companies also offer a multi-line discount, so this is another topic to discuss with your clients. 

ask questions that make people think about insurance.  learn personal details about your clients.  schedule an annual meeting with your current customer base. 

 This reservoir is located on the driver’s side toward the rear of the engine compartment. If fluid is low, then you may have a leak.; , The location of the brake fluid will also help you to locate the general placement of the leak. , Make sure that your car is NOT turned on for this process. Turning on the car would cause the brake fluid to squirt out very quickly and would make the leak hard to control, depending on its severity.  If the leak is coming from within a wheel, then you may have to remove the wheel to check for leaks in the lines and calipers.   It the car has brake drums it may have a leak in the wheel cylinder. You will have to remove the brake drum to check it.  The master cylinder’s placement varies from car to car and will be given in your owner’s manual. If you no longer have a copy, then check online to find the original manual.  Sometimes, fluid can leak from a lid that has not been properly fastened.  

open the hood and check the brake fluid reservoir.  verify the leak by checking beneath the car for the presence of brake fluid.  place newspapers on the ground beneath the general location of the leak.  ,  pump the brake pedal to force fluid out through the leak.  crawl underneath the car and look for the spot where fluid is dripping from the brakes.  check the master cylinder for leaks.  verify that the master cylinder lid is tightly closed.

 There are many popular brands and hundreds of different colors to choose from. Semi-permanent dyes can be found in a variety of places, ranging from grocery stores to specialized fashion shops, with the biggest selection at beauty supply stores. Pick the color that’s your favorite, matches your wardrobe best, and/or is most flattering for your eye color and skin tone. Semi-permanent dyes work on all hair colors, but show up brightest on light hair. On very dark hair, though, they will appear as a very subtle sheen.; , Bleaching hair will make the color turn out brighter on all hair types. If you want intense, bright colors and you have darker hair, you will need to bleach it.Just keep in mind that bleaching may damage your hair.  A patch test is an easy way to check for allergens at home. This step is very important, especially if you have sensitive skin. If you go straight to dyeing your whole head without checking, you may end up with an itchy scalp or permanent hair loss.   Dab a small amount of dye onto a cotton adhesive pad and place it somewhere on your skin that isn’t too sensitive or typically exposed like your upper back. Leave the patch on for however long you plan on leaving the dye in your hair (usually an hour). Remove the patch and rinse the dye from your skin. Wait another 48 hours before dyeing your hair. Do not use this dye if your skin experiences itching, redness, or swelling. If your skin starts itching while the patch is still on, remove it immediately and scrub away the dye with soap and water., Select a small strand of hair that is not on the surface of your hairdo. Dye this strand following the instructions on the bottle.This step can be skipped if you don’t care about the exact shade of your new hair color. If you’ve never bleached your hair before, you may want to do a strand test with both your bleaching method and then with the dye.  Normally you should avoid using a blow dryer, as it can dry out and damage your hair. However, the drier your hair, the better your dye will soak in. Don’t condition your hair until after the dye has been applied and rinsed out.  While semi-permanent dyes eventually wash out of hair, they can be fairly difficult to remove from other materials like most fabrics. Semi-permanent dye is usually easy to remove from skin with a good scrubbing, but the process may take a few days. It's less work to prevent making a mess than cleaning it up later.   Wear some clothes that you don't mind staining. Put a towel down on the floor in the area where you’re working. Wear exam gloves. Place a thin layer of petroleum jelly on the skin along your hairline.  You can dye all of your hair the same shade or you can get more creative. Here are a few options to consider:   Dye only your highlights. Many people with dark hair go for this look with bright colors. Dye just the ends. This is called the "dip dye" look, since it seems like the hair has been dipped in paint. Section off your hair with plastic clips and you can use multiple colors for this method. Two colors from the same brand can be mixed. You can dye your tips one color, the hair near your roots another, and mix the two in the middle for an “ombré” look. Try a wild, multi-colored look or make a pattern by keeping certain sections of your hair un-dyed. Put a little conditioner on the parts of your hair that you want protected.  Place a thick amount of hair dye wherever you want it. The best way to do this varies based on your style:   If you’re dyeing a large area or your whole head, the best way to do this is by massaging the dye in by hand. Grab a palm full of dye and work it into your hair as if you were shampooing. If your hair is long, you will need to do this a few times with more dye to spread the color evenly throughout. You can also try dyeing thicker hair in sections. If you’re dyeing a smaller section, use a special tools called a tint brushes. Dip the brush into the dye and "paint" your hair. This will help you to both control where the color goes and make sure all your hair is coated. Go over each section a few times to make sure the dye is even., How long you should leave it in for will vary by brand, but 30 minutes to an hour is typical. Unlike permanent dyes, which contain harsh chemicals that can damage your hair and skin, there is usually no "too long" with semi-permanent colors.If you want to leave your work area while the dye sets, put your hair in a shower cap to keep from making a mess.  Rinsing in the sink will reduce the chance of dyeing your skin but may be inconvenient. Rinsing in the shower is usually fine, even with dark colors.   Soak your hair thoroughly with running water. This is more important if you've left the dye in so long that it has dried out. Gently wash your hair with color care shampoo. Keeping your hair moisturized will help maintain the color. Keep rinsing your hair until the water starts running clear. If you leave any dye in, you will end up staining anything your hair touches. Apply conditioner. This will also help keep your hair moist. Allow your hair to air dry. Blow drying will dry out your hair too much and make your new color fade faster.  Semi-permanent dye will fade more each time you wash your hair. To make the color last longer, wash your hair as infrequently as you can get away with. The thicker and less oily your hair, the less often you need to wash it., When you do wash your hair, be sure to use a shampoo that will minimize fade. Most major shampoo brands have at least one color-protecting product. If you have trouble finding one at the drugstore, try checking a specialty beauty supply shop.  Dry hair is more prone to fading. Use conditioner, whether rinse-out or leave-in.If you have very textured, coily type hair, try using shea butter.  The nature of semi-permanent hair color is that it doesn’t last forever. Dye your hair using the same steps above once it fades to a color you aren’t quite happy with. You could also try a different color. If you bleached your hair before, don’t bleach it again unless your roots have grown out.  

find the color you want.  bleach your hair if necessary.  perform a patch test.  do a strand test.  wash your hair with clarifying shampoo and blow dry it completely.  protect your skin and clothes.  figure out color placement.  apply the hair dye.  let the dye set.  rinse out the dye.  minimize hair washing.  use color-protecting shampoo.  keep your hair moisturized.  repeat dyeing as needed. 

 In addition to a photo, you're going to need paper for the card. Any type will do, but if you plan to use photo paper to print a copy of the the photo, a heavier type, such as construction paper, is a better option that basic printer paper. You'll also need paper to print a copy of the photo, scissors for trimming, and a glue stick for adhering the photo.   You can also add extra embellishments to the card, such as stickers, stamps, and scrapbook supplies.  Look through your digital photos to find one that is appropriate for the occasion. For example, you might use a baby photo or recent snapshot of the person whose birthday it is. You can use a photo of birthday cake that you might have, or a picture of the addressee’s favorite location, such as the beach.You can use a single photo or multiple photos. For example, you might want to place a baby photo side by side with a recent picture of the person who you’re giving the card to.  Take the piece of paper that you've chosen for your card, and fold it in half. If you're using multiple photos for the card, it's best to only fold it once. If you're using a single picture, you may want to fold the paper in half twice., Once you’ve settled on the photo(s) that you want to use, print a copy of it from your computer. Use scissors to trim the picture so it will fit on the card once it’s folded.You can use photo paper or printer paper to print the copy of your photo(s) on. Depending on the look that you’re going for, you may want to apply some type of filter to the photo with photo editing software before printing it. For example, you might create a black and white copy for an artsy look or use a sepia tone to give the photo an old-fashioned feel. When you trim the photo, you can cut it into any shape that you like. Keep it rectangular, or trim it into a heart or star shape if you prefer.  When you’ve trimmed the photo to the desired shape and size, use a glue stick to attach it to the front of the card. Make sure to leave some room to write “Happy Birthday” or any other message that you might want on the front of the card when you place it.Make a more eye-catching card by decorating around the photo. You can draw a design around it, or use embellishments, such as stickers, stamps, and scrapbook supplies, to dress up the card.  After you’ve placed the photo on the front of the card, you can personalize the card with a message on the inside. You may want to consider adding another photo to the card’s interior. 

prepare your supplies.  find a photo.  fold a piece of paper.  print a copy from your computer and trim.  adhere the photo(s) to the front of the card.  add a message inside. 

 First of all, you need to compare the two choices. You need to think carefully about what you will benefit from buying a PC or a Mac. Are you using it for entertainment purposes (music, movies, games) or for business or education purposes? What you're going to do with your computer should reflect what suits you.; , Macs are generally more expensive, but usually need less maintenance (viruses, hardware malfunctions, etc.) However, PCs are usually less expensive but may have more costs (monitor - see below, hardware repair, virus repair) This is not to say that PCs always have hardware issues and that Macs never do, but it is less likely for a Mac to have the issues that PCs do. Also, if a Mac has hardware issues, you will probably have to have it sent away for repairs, whereas a PC is easier to open up and fix the problem yourself.  There may be other costs to consider when buying a computer, like the cost of a monitor, speakers, microphone, or webcam. Most Macs have these features built in. Also consider space for peripherals. Macs usually have fewer USB/FireWire/Audio jacks than a PC does, warranting the cost for hubs and attachments if extra space is needed. Also, on a Mac, software for video editing, music production, website design, photo management, DVD production, video capturing, etc. is included. On a PC, some of this software is omitted or some of the functionality you would get on a Mac is not available in that program. Some may consider software like this unnecessary, in which case a PC would be right for you.  As a first time Mac user, it will be hard for you to adjust to whole different layout and functions, and Vise versa. Make sure you watch different tutorials and read more into Macs/PCs before buying one.  

compare.  check the price.  consider other possible costs.  macs are also very different from windows. 

 There are many reasons a teacher might have a bad impression of you. If you can identify a specific thing you did or said that gave the teacher a bad impression, let them know you understand it. This can be huge way to show maturity.Apologize if that is appropriate. For example, you could say, “I’m really sorry I was late on the first day of class. I’m sure that didn’t give a very good impression. However, that was definitely an exception and I plan to always be on time from now on.” Don’t overdo it. Generally, a sincere apology followed by meaningful action is enough. Don’t repeat your apology or beg for forgiveness.; , Your teacher may make assumptions about you based on your appearance or behavior. After all, they’ve probably met a lot of students and think they’re able to tell a lot about a student pretty quickly. If you think you’re being misunderstood or judged, help your teacher understand who you really are.There might be things about your appearance that cause a teacher to judge you. Take a minute to consider if there’s anything your teacher might be noticing and judging. For example, if you walk into the first day of class with black eye, they might assume you’re the kind of person who gets into fights. Simply explain away the misunderstanding by telling the truth. You can say something like, “I know this black eye looks pretty scary. I actually got it playing baseball last week when my team went to the state championships.”  , Teachers notice who’s engaged in class and who comes prepared. If your teacher has a bad impression of you, it could be that they’ve noticed that you don’t show up to class prepared or that you aren’t taking responsibility for your own learning.Prepare for class. This doesn’t necessarily mean studying hard or even doing your homework. It means being ready to engage with your teacher and classmates. This includes getting enough sleep and coming to class eager to learn. Always have handy any necessary materials such as books, notebooks, or pencils. This shows that you’re taking responsibility for your role as a student.  Your teacher might have a bad impression of you without you knowing why. This can be very difficult. Sometimes, teachers are just judgemental. Sometimes you remind them of another student they had in the past. Do what you can to show them that you're worthy of more consideration.   Be kind and patient with your teacher. That's probably how you like to be treated, too. If you think the treatment you're getting is really unfair, try asking them why they seem to think badly of you. Letting them know that you notice and are concerned can go a long way.  

address any specific incidents.  explain any potential misunderstandings.  be prepared for class.  work against unjustified bad impressions. 

 Use a colander to drain the water and then run cold water over the potatoes. When they're cooled, peel, and cut them into 2 inch (5.1 cm) sized pieces.; ,, Allow the seeds to splutter. It's a good idea to keep the lid on for this step since the seeds may jump all over if you don't.  Fry the onions until they are golden brown.  Give a quick stir to release the flavors from them.  Turn up the heat to medium and stir fry the potatoes for a few minutes until they are well coated with spices.  Stir gently from time to time, taking care not to break the potatoes. 

boil the potatoes in their skin.  heat oil in a wok or a good sized frying pan.  ,  cook the mustard seeds and bay leaf.  add the ginger and onions to the pan.  turn the heat down and add all of the ground spices.  add the potatoes to the pan.  cook everything for about five minutes on a low to medium heat.  serve hot with a garnish of coriander leaves.  

 This is a digital key which allows you to sign digital documents. There are many other uses for OpenPGP keys in Ubuntu such as uploading packages and using the bug tracker's e-mail interface.   In Ubuntu, open the "System" menu, then go to Preferences->Passwords and Encryption Keys. Click File->New->PGP Key and follow the on-screen instructions to generate your key. If you're unable to use the graphical PGP key generator, you can run "gpg --gen-key" from the terminal. The most important part of the key to remember is the passphrase. If you forget your passphrase, the key is no longer usable.; , Without publishing your key, it will be rendered useless. Ubuntu needs your key to verify that it is you signing the document.   To do this, in Passwords and Encryption Keys, select the My Personal Keys tab, and then your key. Next, open the Remote menu and click Sync and Publish Keys... and then press the Sync button. You may need to select the Ubuntu keyserver using the 'Key Servers' button first. If using the terminal, find the output from the first step and find the bit like "pub 2048R/D8FC66D2". Copy the code after the slash and run the command gpg --send-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com D8FC66D2, replacing the code with your key code.  In Passwords and Encryption Keys, click My Personal Keys then your key and either double click it or press spacebar. Select the Details tab. Copy the code from the "Fingerprint" section.  Create an account if you don't have one already.   Once logged in, click your name in the top-right corner. This is your profile. Next to "Signed Ubuntu Code of Conduct", you may see "No". Click the pencil icon next to it. You can access this directly by visiting the Code of Conduct page at https://launchpad.net/codeofconduct.  Follow the Register an OpenPGP key on the Code of Conduct page. Enter your fingerprint, then hit "Import Key".  Launchpad should have sent a verification e-mail to you with an encrypted message.

 If your goal is invest small amounts of money online, your number one objective should be to find a broker with very low to no minimum required investment. Typically, brokers do require at least $1,000 minimum investment, but there are many that require less.   Currently, online brokers that have no minimum initial investment include TD Ameritrade, Capital One Investing, First Trade, TradeKing, and OptionsHouse."Small Amounts of Money" varies between investors. For investors with slightly higher minimums, E*Trade requires a $500 minimum, and Charles Schwab requires $1,000. Note that investing less than $500 is often not recommended, since there is typically a fee per trade of over $5, which means a $500 investment essentially starts off with a 1% loss due to the fee. You can avoid brokerage fees — and sometimes a broker entirely — by enrolling in a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) directly thorough an underlying company. Instead of receiving your dividends in the form of cash, the dividends will be automatically reinvested in the company for price appreciation and compounding. Some DRIPs are free, while others require a small fee.; , Unfortunately, investing online is not free, and brokers do charge a variety of fees. These fees are typically charged per trade (meaning you are charged once when you buy something, and once when you sell). These are known as commissions   Before opening an account, it is important to look at the fees charged on stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds). These are the three main types of investments that are appropriate for those investing small sums.Typically, commissions on stock transactions for small trades range from $4.95 to $10.00, whereas mutual fund commissions range from $15 to $80. ETFs are often offered commission-free by brokers. Since mutual funds and ETFs are important types of investments for those investing small sums of money, you should select a broker with low mutual fund fees, and commission-free ETF trading. Websites like Stockbrokers.com can be a valuable resource for comparing fees between brokers. You can use this website to look at all the brokers mentioned above to choose the one with the lowest cost.  Once you select a broker that has both low minimums (allowing you to invest small sums), and low fees for stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, you will need to choose an account type to open. While there are many types, the main ones to know are Individual, Traditional IRA, and Roth IRA.    Individual account. These are offered by most brokers, and they are standard accounts with no special tax privileges. This means any profits you make while investing and any income you earn from your investments will be taxed at appropriate rates.  Traditional IRA. A traditional IRA is a type of retirement savings account. Money deposited into a traditional IRA grows tax-deferred (meaning you don't pay any tax until you withdraw it), at which point it is taxed at normal income. With a Traditional IRA, you cannot withdraw money until you are at least 59.5 years of age, or you will receive a penalty. Contributions to a traditional IRA are usually tax-deductible.  Contributions to IRAs, whether traditional or Roth, are limited by income earned.    Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is also a type of retirement savings account. Like a Traditional IRA, earnings grow tax-free, except contributions are not tax deductible. The main benefit is that when you withdraw the money, you do not pay any taxes on your contributions (since they were paid on your income before you contributed). You can also withdraw your initial contributions any time with no penalty or taxes.Which to choose? The answer depends entirely on when you need the money and your goals. If you are starting a retirement account and do not plan on using the money until you are 59.5, the Traditional IRA may be appropriate. If you need the money sooner, a Roth IRA or individual account are likely better options.  

select a broker with low account minimums.  examine fees carefully.  select an account type to open. 

 Ask your honoree and party organizers to reserve the date. The ideal timing might be a week or two after the birthday celebration.; , Distribute the invitations as guests are leaving the birthday celebration.   Send an email reminder about the Picture Revealing Party, too.  Include photos taken at the birthday celebration (as well as the planning party, see link below). Be sure to include great quotes from the party.  You can do this on a television, a wall or a screen; test the setup to be sure that it works. ,   Blindfold your honoree. Display each page of the album for everyone to see (except the blindfolded honoree). As each photo is displayed have all of the guests make humorous comments about it. Ask your honoree to describe what s/he thinks the picture is showing. Take lots of notes. Remove honoree's blindfold. Note: this game might be most fun if the honoree was blindfolded for part of their birthday celebration, such as the activity holding signs (see reference on Birthday Suggestions website below) so they genuinely don't know what is on some of the album pages.  Take some photos as the honoree and guests view pages of the album for the first time. If you played the Previewing the Album game, read back the honorees description of each photo just before you show the page that relates to the description. See how closely the description matches the photo. , Include these along with photos taken at the revealing in an appendix to the album.  If you decide to post the album, be sure that the guest of honor and others included in the pictures agree to the online posting and privacy settings for the album.  

determine a date, time and place for the picture revealing party.  design and print invitations to the picture revealing party.  design and develop a great photo album on your computer.  determine how you will project the photos.  plan and prepare a nice menu (snacks or a meal) for the party.  ,  play a previewing the album game, if desired.  view the album:  show the photo album to all of the guests and record the honorees and guests comments.  present the honoree with a printed copy of the album.  ,  prepare a summary of the comments from the picture revealing party.  distribute the album to the honoree and guests via email. 

 Don't feel shy about sharing information about yourself—it helps the autistic person get to know you, and feel more comfortable around you. Talk about yourself, and ask them about themselves.; , Bonding is a great way to get along with each other! Interacting with other people can be challenging for autistic people, but that doesn't mean that they don't enjoy it. Most often you may need to be the one to make first contact and initiate any discussion, since autistic people may struggle with initiating social interaction.  For example, some autistic people are sensitive to sound, so don't be surprised if your new friend can't handle loud music or crowded places. In many cases you can work around these limitations, such as meeting up in quieter areas and turning the volume down a little on your music. Usually the autistic person knows exactly what (s)he can and can't handle.    Read their body language, and ask how they're doing. "Are the flickering lights bothering you? Would you like to go outside?" Pay attention to their stimming. Stimming can express a range of emotions—joy, excitement, disgust, or overwhelm. If you notice them stimming with an unpleasant expression, that means that something is probably wrong.  While some very young autistic children don't understand why they are different, most autistic people are well aware of their differences, and they take it in their stride so they can live a happy and comfortable life.  Autistic people may suffer from a number of things: comorbid conditions (e.g. anxiety, depression, epilepsy), rude or abusive therapists, or parents who treat them like a project instead of a human being. Offering a supportive ear is an incredible gift to them.   If their therapy is trying to make them normal, or they are scared/unhappy about going, then it's probably harmful.Tell an adult who will take it seriously. Your friend might be in danger. Due to the prevalence of compliance therapies (which emphasize obedience above all else),autistic people are at higher risk for abuse.Get help right away if you suspect that someone is hurting your friend. Gift them a Service dog. It encourages social interaction.  Find little things that they are good at and notice them. They will have more confidence with things that they do, and that will help them stand up for themselves in the future.  Autistic people often have passionate and idiosyncratic interests. While some people may like things such as sports, movies, TV, etc. other people, including some autistic people might be interested in things such as frogs, clocks, writing novels, washing machines, social justice, robots, sarcasm, or pet rocks. Autistic people tend to be especially passionate and knowledgeable about their subjects of interest. Try not to generalize about what any autistic person may like or dislike. Rainman was an entertaining movie, not an educational documentary., The internet is full of autistic bloggers with tips on how to be a good friend to autistic people. Autistic people may feel mistrustful or even afraid of you if you praise Autism Speaks or talk about how terrible it is to be autistic.   Musings of an Aspie, Emma's Hope Book, and Real Social Skills are a few well-known blogs. Check out autism-friendly organizations. Look for groups that include autistic people in their highest levels of leadership, emphasize quality of life over a eugenic cure, and advocate for acceptance.Avoid fear mongering or dangerous anti-vaccination rhetoric.  Many autistic people have been treated like burdens and problems by their family because of their autism. Showing that you love the person for who they are, including their autism, means the world to them. Kind words, respect, gifts, and support will mean a lot to an autistic person.  

introduce yourself the same way you would to anyone else.  hang out with them.  ask them about their needs.  help them with their disabilities.  help them with problems.  compliment them.  recognize the validity of their interests.  research.  show them compassion and acceptance. 

 Most panels come up to 32 feet (9.8 m) in length. Allow for a minimum of 18 inches (45.7 cm) if you need to lap to complete the run.   Cutting tools:Angle grinder: The fastest option. Wear hearing and eye protection. Paint or prime cut edges to prevent rust.Circular saw: Slower than angle grinder, but follow same instructions. Use a metal blade and expect it to wear quickly.Nibbler: Effective if rated for the right metal and gauge.Tin snips: Slow but safe. Wear work gloves and find the longest pair you can.  Use a 3/16-inch (4.76 ml) drill bit.   Spacing for the holes on the ends and sides of the panels should be 6 to 8 inches (15.3 to 20.4 cm).  Place them directly onto purlins that are attached to the roof trusses, beginning on the outside edge.   Close or seal off the ends with a wood or plastic strip under the panel at each end. These will stop the entry of rain, wind and pests.  Pre-drill the holes, and use #10X2-inch (#10X5.2 cm) screws with polycarbonate washers.   Continue across the roof until it is completely covered, lapping over the previous panel by at least 2.5 inches (5.5 cm) minimum. Adjust the lap so that the last panel completes the coverage without making a cut lengthwise.  If your roof is two-sided (and not just a single slope), repeat the installation on the other side of the roof, and install a corrugated ridge cap as you proceed across with the panels.  

cut the panels to the length.  pre-drill holes on the ridges.  install the panels.  screw down the panels.  complete the opposite side. 

 Your skin is your body's largest organ. It only makes sense to try to protect it from harmful elements. For example, you should wear sunscreen every day. Make it part of your daily routine.If you smoke, quit. Avoiding the harmful effects of cigarettes is a great way to prevent damage to your skin. Eat a healthy diet. Make sure to get plenty of vitamin-packed fruits and veggies. You should also drink plenty of water.  Your skin is your body's first line of defense against infections. Breaks in your skin can allow harmful bacteria to get into your skin. Taking care of the skin can have an important impact on your overall health. Make sure to keep your skin hydrated and clean.  Improving the health of your skin is also great for your mental health. Research shows that clear skin leads to greater confidence. When you feel better about yourself, you will naturally be more happy and relaxed. An increase in confidence can help you avoid symptoms of depression and anxiety. 

learn to prevent damage.  know the health benefits.  increase your confidence. 

 To make sugar paste penguins from scratch, you must first make the sugar paste and edible glue. These both need time to set and mature, so it’s important to start one to two days before you want to assemble the penguins.  Once you make the sugar paste dough, it needs to sit for 24 hours before you can use it. After making the edible glue, it requires 12 hours to set before you can use it to assemble the penguin parts.; , To make and assemble the penguins, you'll need your white, black, and orange sugar paste, along with a few tools. Other supplies you'll need include:  Stand mixer or large mixing bowl Paddle attachment or electric beaters Two sealable plastic bags Small mixing bowl Whisk Fondant rolling pin Sharp knife Small decorating brush Small oval cookie cutter, about three-quarter inches (19 mm) long Small round cookie cutter, about one-quarter inch (6 mm) in diameter Black edible marker  , Place the egg whites into a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat the eggs in the stand mixer or with electric beaters on medium speed for about 10 seconds, or long enough to break up the egg whites.If you're using a stand mixer, use the paddle attachment to make the sugar paste. When you're making sugar paste, the dough will have to sit for 24 hours, so start this one to two days before you want to make your sugar paste penguins.  Turn the mixer to low speed and gradually add 6 cups (750 g) of the powdered sugar, beating it in one cup (125 g) at a time. When you’ve added the 6 cups of sugar, continue beating until it takes on the consistency of icing.  Increase the speed of the mixer to medium and beat the mixture for two minutes, until the mixture starts to form soft peaks. The soft peak stage means the mixture will form peaks, but they’ll melt back into the mixture within a couple seconds., Turn the mixer to low speed and slowly sprinkle in the tylose powder. Continue mixing for about 30 seconds, then turn the mixer to high for 30 seconds.  As the tylose is incorporated, it will thicken everything to a dough. Tylose powder is a food additive that’s also called carboxymethycellulose. It’s used to make thick pastes that harden when they dry, which is why it’s great for making sugar paste., Dust a flat surface with powdered sugar and turn the dough out onto it. Knead the dough, gradually adding the remaining ⅔ cup (83 g) of powdered sugar, until you have a soft dough.When the dough is ready, it will be soft and pliable, but not sticky to the touch.  Place the dough into a sealable freezer bag. Press out as much air as you can to prevent the dough from drying out. Seal the bag, and then place that bag into a second sealable bag.  Move the dough to the fridge and let it rest for 24 hours., In a small bowl, combine the tylose powder and warm water. Whisk the two together to remove as many lumps as possible.Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or put a lid on. Transfer the mixture to the fridge and let it set overnight, about 12 hours. As the mixture sets, it will become thick and syrupy. This mixture will form an edible glue that you can use to attach different parts of the penguin to the body.  When the dough has had 24 hours to relax, remove it from the fridge and let it warm up to room temperature.To make the penguins, you'll need black dough for the bodies, white dough for the stomachs and face, and orange dough for the beaks and feet. To divide the dough:  Cut the dough in half and set one half aside for the bodies. With the remaining dough, use your eye to divide the dough into thirds. Use a knife to notch the one-third divisions into the dough. Cut off one-third of the dough, and leave the remaining two-thirds intact. This larger section will remain white, so you don’t have to add any food coloring to it.  Drizzle a flat work surface with some of the vegetable oil. Take the large half of dough and turn it out onto the oiled surface. Add about 10 drops of black food coloring, and gently knead the color into the dough.  Knead in more food coloring in 10-drop increments until you achieve the desired intensity of black for the bodies.  Clean off your work surface so there's no leftover sugar, oil, or coloring. Drizzle fresh oil on the surface. Turn out the small one-third section of dough, and knead five drops of orange food coloring into the dough.  Knead in more color until you achieve the desired intensity for the beaks and feet.  Remove enough sugar paste from the black dough to form a sphere with a one-inch (2.5-cm) diameter. Roll the dough into a ball, and then roll it into an oval to create the body of the penguin. Press the top and bottom of the oval to flatten them out.Flattening the top and bottom of the oval will give you a platform for the head and allow the penguin to stand. To make a larger penguin, increase the amount of dough you use to create the body, and use proportionally more dough to create the other body parts as well.  Roll out the white sugar paste into a circle that’s one-sixteenth inch (1.6 mm) thick. Use the cookie cutter to cut out an oval.Dip the decorating brush into the edible glue and coat one side of the oval with a thin layer of glue. Press the white oval onto the center of the black body and apply delicate pressure to secure the belly.   If you don’t have small cookie cutters, use a knife to cut out the oval.  Remove some sugar paste from the black dough and roll it into a sphere with a half-inch (1.3-cm) diameter. To make the face, use the round cookie cutter and punch out a white circle from the white sugar paste.  Use the brush to apply some edible glue to the face, and gently press the face onto the head. To make the eyes, apply two dots of edible marker to the penguin’s head.If you don’t have an edible marker, you can use two black sprinkles, sesame seeds, or tiny balls of black sugar paste instead.  Break off a pea-sized piece of orange dough. With your fingers, roll it into a teardrop shape. Gently flatten the teardrop between your fingers. At the wider end, flatten the curve a little so it will conform to the shape of the penguin’s head.  Dip the brush in the glue and apply a thin layer to the beak before pressing the beak gently onto the head. Center the beak below and between the two eyes. With your knife, cut a slit on either side of the beak to make it look like and upper and lower half., Apply a layer of glue to the bottom of the penguin’s head. Gently press the head into the body, being careful not to squish the beak or alter the shape of the head or body., For the first wing, break off a piece of dough that’s about the size of two peas. Roll the dough between your fingers to form it into a teardrop shape. Flatten the teardrop between your fingers. The rounded half will be the top of the wing.Apply some glue to the rounded half of the teardrop. Attach this end to the left side of the penguin’s body where the head and body meet. Repeat for the right wing.  Break off a piece of orange sugar paste that’s about the size of two peas. Roll the ball into a teardrop shape, then flatten it with your finger.Apply some glue to the pointed end of the teardrop, and attach it to the body.  Attach the foot to the front of the body, slightly left of center. Repeat with the right foot.  

start a day early.  gather your supplies.  beat the egg whites.  beat in the sugar.  mix in the tylose.  knead the dough.  let the dough rest.  make the edible glue.  warm and divide the dough.  color the black dough.  color the orange dough.  make the body.  add the belly.  shape the head and face.  make and attach the beak.  attach the head.  shape and attach the wings.  mold the feet and attach them to the body. 

 To begin your hydroponic gardening project you will only need a few things to get you off to a great start. Many of the items you need for hydroponics can already be found around your house so you can save money before you go full tilt into this hobby or found all together in a hydroponic garden.; , Most newbie gardeners can either purchase an easy to install grow room or build a greenhouse outside of their home. Small grow rooms for the beginning hydroponic gardener are usually slightly larger than a closet and can be completely installed in under an hour. The cost ranges from several hundred dollars to over $500, depending on the add-ons that you think you will need.  A small greenhouse can cost considerably more because you will need to either include a cement floor and drainage system or lay other types of flooring such as gravel before you build the greenhouse itself. Many small greenhouses cost anywhere from $500 to over several thousand dollars, depending on the add-ons you choose.   The basic items you need after you decide on either a grow room or greenhouse include a temperature control unit, exhaust fan, heating mats, light fixtures for your blue and red spectrum lights, an aeration system (an aquarium system works well for small gardens), pearlite, marble and Styrofoam work well as a beginning medium and rockwool, oasis or Rapid Rooters. Typical beginning tables for your plants include plastic tubs, a child’s swimming pool or fish tank. A gardener can also buy any of the items they need for their grow room from stores specializing in hydroponic supplies.  Make sure that it can be grown where you live (don't choose a citrus plant if you're living in Alaska, for instance) and that it isn't a plant that is grown underground.  Fold it over, and place it gently in a clear, sealable bag.  Germination is triggered when a seed is wet, so keep the paper towels moist. Don't forget that some seeds take longer than others.  What you do next depends on the type of plant.   If the seed has a frailer stem, keep it in the original paper towel but cut small holes for the leaves to emerge through. If the seed has a stronger stem, feel free to cover only the roots in wet paper towels and let the stem straighten out and grow leaves.  This is a very fragile time in their life, so be extremely gentle. , You can choose between having one plant per container, or doing a larger container with many plants. If you choose the second option, make sure that all the plants have good support.  If you are growing a plant that gets much taller, you should probably tape a support to the side of the container.  Also, plants need nutrients to grow, so buy a pack of liquid fertilizer to add to the water every week. Follow the package instructions, and don't overfeed the plants.  They will open and dry up, leaving behind the start of a fruit or vegetable.   If the plant needs cross-pollination in order to be fertilized, place the plant outside or near an open window for a few days so that insects can do the job. A good plant for hydroponic gardening is one that self pollinates.  Normally, plants can anchor themselves into the dirt for extra support. Check your plant's stem daily for any cracks or bending points.  Enjoy your hydroponic garden!  

do not go overboard buying hydroponics supplies that they may need in the future but will not need in the beginning stages of hydroponic gardening.  create a dedicated area for their gardening.  get the right hydroponic supplies.  choose the seed you want to grow.  take wet paper towels and place the seed(s) inside them.  put the bag in a warm, dark place and give the seeds some time to germinate.  keep in mind that, when the seeds have germinated and is showing at least one inch of stem, it is a seedling.  watch the seedling(s) carefully so that they grow straight.  move your plant into its permanent container when the seedling is stronger and bigger.  ,  fill the container with water.  place your grown seedling into the water, so that only the roots are submerged.  change the water every few days, especially if it seems to get murky or translucent.  if you chose a plant that bears fruit, watch for flower buds growing near the leaves.  make sure that the flowers don't weigh the stem down, if you chose a flowering plant.  harvest the fruit/vegetables like any other plant. 

 People may notice that you two aren’t friends anymore and ask you what went down. It’s okay to say something non-specific, like “we just kind of drifted apart,” but don’t get into the details. Talking trash about your former friend is mean and immature, no matter what happened to cause the friendship to fall apart.If your friend gets nasty, spreading rumors or gossiping about you on social media, try not to engage. There’s no point in dragging things out or defending yourself to someone you don’t even want to be friends with anymore.If anything, it shows that you made the right decision.  Things might be awkward for a while, and your friend may be angry or hurt, but treat her with kindness and respect. Remember that this is someone who was once your friend—maybe even your best friend—so honor what you had.Don’t do the look-of-death thing or straight-up ignore her. Just give her a small smile or nod of acknowledgment and move along.  Ending one friendship may cause ripples if you’re part of the same group. Mutual friends may take sides, ask you to reconcile with her, or even get angry.Try not to get upset if some of your mutual friends feel they need to take sides. This may happen, and it’s going to hurt, but those people are petty and looking for drama, and you don’t need them in your life. 

don't gossip if people ask you what happened.  be polite when you see her.  don’t get drawn into any drama if your mutual friends get upset. 

 If you are faced with a bully, one of the best strategies to use is removing yourself from the situation. Take a different route to class. Walk in a group where you are less likely to be singled out. If it is not possible to avoid the bully all together, make sure you are never alone with him or her. The bully may not want witnesses to the bad behavior so even taking the step to have another person with you may help to end the problem.  Be careful to not make it an obvious reaction out of fear that you are avoiding the bully. Bullies often target those they can scare or get a reaction out of. Be stealthy about your avoidance. Do not give him or her satisfaction of having that power over you. If the bully is finding you on social media, block the profile. Remove any connections you share with the bully on the internet.This works best for the bully you may only know online. If this is the case, he or she will generally move onto another target. If you do block the profile, be aware that the bully may create a new and different profile so be careful about adding new people.; , A bully may call names or try to embarrass you, but ignoring the taunts may send the message that he or she will not be getting a reaction out of you. The bully will likely move on.This is going to be very hard to do in some cases, but think of it as a game and it may get easierDo not feel like you need to explain or acknowledge you are ignoring the bully. He or she is usually very purposeful of the action and are well aware of what is being done. Telling a bully you are ignoring them only lets him or her know it is bothering you.  Making a joke at someone else’s expense is often the go-to behavior for a bully. You can take the sting out of this by simply laughing along.This approach also works if the bully uses sarcastic compliments to be mean. Instead of getting upset when he or she tells you that you look nice but in a tone you know is not sincere, say “Why, thanks, Bethany!” as nicely as you can and walk away. Using humor may seem odd in the case of the bully using you are a joke punchline, but remember your hurt feelings are a huge reward for the negative behavior. If the bully sees you either do not care or do not “get” you are being made fun of, the jokes will stop.  If you are being bullied by a coworker or a family member whom you interact with frequently, you need to speak with this person privately about his or her behavior.   Be careful about being alone with this person though, talk to them in private but not in isolation if that makes sense. This could mean talking in the break room at work after lunch so others are close by. Enlist the help of another co-worker, if you are at work, who can be close by if needed to get help.Make your comments specific to the behavior without giving the bully feedback about it making you feel bad. For example, say “The taunting is disruptive to my day. I’d appreciate it if you stopped.” Also, if you say anything about going to HR if this is at work, be ready to do just that.  Bullies often target people they know they can get a rise out of. Do not give the bully what he or she wants. Take a deep breath and continue on with what you were doing, or walk away.  It might help to repeat a mantra in your head to maintain your calm in the face of a bully. Repeat something like “Don’t give him/her a reaction” or “Keep it cool.”  , Studies show that people are less likely to get teased or bullied if they exhibit an assertive attitude. You can stop being a victim to bullying by changing your reaction. Beware of your body language. Lift your chin, keep your back straight, and pull your shoulders back.Showing strong, positive signals like this probably doesn’t come naturally to you. Therefore, it may be helpful to practice your assertive attitude at home while you’re away from the bully.  Keeping a record of the bully’s taunts will help you to keep dates straight and establish a pattern. You will need to establish a pattern if this goes further and you report the behavior to a boss at work or the police if this is a domestic situation that you need help for.  Saving any emails and taking screenshots of comments left on social media can document cyber activities. Do not expect the bully to leave comments posted on social media up. Take a screen shot right away.  Make sure this conversation includes a clear picture of the pattern and any documentation. If you are at school, you can tell an instructor or a school administrator.If this is at work, you may come to the meeting with suggestions as to how this can be fixed. This might include moving the bully to a different department or working with HR. Be prepared to be asked what you want to have happen. If you meet with the person at work face-to-face, follow up with an email documenting when the meeting took place and follow ups so you have it in writing what occurred. This will be included in the documentation if the behavior continues.  The behavior, not matter how personal of an attack that is used, is never about you. It’s about the need of the bully to get attention or to perseverate behaviors picked up elsewhere.  Understanding the motive of a bully helps you to realize that his or her behavior is not personally-directed at you. Such behavior may stem from jealousy, feeling threatened, or not getting the attention he or she feels is deserved. You’re not doing anything wrong—it’s not about you., This probably is not the first time the bully has acted like this so he or she is probably pretty good at it. You do not want to open yourself up to a situation where the only behavior anyone sees is your reaction and you get into trouble.It may be tempting to react online if this is a case of cyber-bullying, but keep in mind it is very easy to bait you into saying really horrible things online and then the bully can simply erase what started the exchange. Now you are left looking like the bad guy.  Becoming physical with a bully should be avoided at all costs. Whether you are at school, work, or in another environment, getting into an altercation can mean being arrested and charged with assault.   Physical self-defense should only be used as a last resort when required to protect yourself from the other person. Try to avoid this if you can., The bully may choose to intimidate you to the point that you feel like there’s no one you can turn to. Share the experience with others. See a counselor. Deny this person the opportunity to steal away your voice. 

avoid the bully whenever possible.  ignore any inappropriate behavior.  use humor.  confront someone with whom you spend time with regularly.  remain calm.  be mindful of your physical and emotional reaction.  document any offenses.  speak to a superior or someone who can help.  refuse to take bullying behavior personally.  don’t reciprocate bullying behavior.  refrain from getting into a physical altercation.  choose not to allow yourself to become isolated by a bully. 

 Purchase a day planner that allows you to write down your assignments. Write down assignments as soon as they are mentioned in class. Write down all details, including the due date, page numbers, and requirements for the assignment. Review your planner every day before you sit down for your daily homework time., Don’t wait until the last second to finish big assignments. Set goals in your planner, like when you want to complete research, an outline, and a draft of your paper. Try to arrange your schedule so that you complete drafts for papers several days before they are due. That way, you can go back and edit them with fresh eyes. The stress of completing a paper at the last second can also be debilitating.   Sometimes we procrastinate because we are afraid of failure. You need to conquer these fears. Even great writers have terrible first drafts. The process of editing is how bad writing becomes good. If you are too afraid of failure to start early, failure is precisely what you will get. If procrastination is a problem, consider creating a designated work space, free of distractions. Leave your books and other work material around. If your environment is telling you to work, your brain might just get the message., So that you don’t lose your assignments, keep a separate homework binder for all of your completed assignments. Keep notes and other course materials in their own binders for their respective subjects. 

create a planner.  break up large assignments.  create a homework folder. 

 Drumsticks are usually made of either maple, hickory, or a Japanese white oak. Laminated birch has also recently regained popularity. Each has a slightly different feel. The feel has to do with how the stick transmits or absorbs vibration and how much it flexes.Hickory is a common, well rounded wood for drumsticks. Hickory is favored for its flexibility and impact resistance. Maple is much lighter than hickory, allowing for a larger diameter feel without the weight. Maple is softer and stiffer than maple, which negative impacts the sticks durability. Maple sounds sweeter and brighter on drums and cymbals. Oak is dense and heavy, but transmits vibrations more. It tends to be more durable, but will split with little warning. The increased weight gives drums a bigger, darker sound and yields a very big, but brash cymbal sound. Laminated Birch is made from a high quality birch plywood. These sticks are very heavy and durable. They generate very deep sounds from drums and cymbals. There are smaller companies specializing in exotic woods and Vic Firth is currently making a carbon fiber stick. Also, companies like Ahead make sticks out of nylon.; , Tips come in wood, nylon, or delrin. Nylon tips sound brighter on cymbals and hold up longer without chipping or developing soft spots. They don't typically change the sound of the drums, though the lighter tip weight can create a fast rebound, allowing the drum to speak easier. Delrin is used by some companies in place or nylon since it is supposedly more durable.   Wooden tips have a darker contact sound and a less articulate sound on cymbals.  Tips come in a wide variety of shapes, each with its on sound. Common tip shapes are barrel, acorn, ball, and oval. Each shape has a particular sound. Each shape also comes in multiple sizes. Smaller creates a more articulate sound while larger tips create bigger and deeper sounds. Some companies shape their nylon tips like wood tips; others do not.   Barrel tips have a wide, flat contact surface. This creates a dark, but strong contact sound. Acorn tips have the largest contact surface. This dampens the contact sound significantly, creating a full, but dark cymbal sound. Ball tips have a very small contact surface, creating a very bright contact sound. Oval tips are between barrel and ball tips.  The thickness also changes the sound. There are two ways to know the thickness of a stick. The first is by model number. A's are thinner than B's, which are thinner than S's. Higher numbers represent thinner sticks. So, a 7A is thinner than a 5A, which is in turn smaller than a 5B. This system has become unreliable with the wide range of manufacturers each with a large catalog of sticks.   The other way to know the thickness of a stick is to find its diameter. This is usually measured in inches and displayed as a three digit decimal. .500 is a half inch thick, for example. 7As are thinner and lighter. These will sound sweeter on drums and cymbals and are best for lower volume playing. 5As are slightly thicker than the 7A. These are generally considered to be the most generic and versatile stick. 5Bs are thicker, more intense drumsticks and are often used by rock and metal drummers due to their weight. There are many other models and each company has its own idiosyncrasies. For example, Promark has a thinner 5A than most. Vic Firth's 7A is shorter than most while their 8D is more like everyone's 7A.    Hold the stick as you would while playing. Let it slide through your fingers. Different manufacturers use different coatings that affect grip. Vic Firth favors a thin lacquer while Regal Tip favors a heavy lacquer, making their sticks a bit slicker and more resistant to skin oils and moisture. Promark favors a special finish that becomes tacky as your hands heat it up. Promark also offers many sticks finished only by sanding. Zildjian and Vic Firth also offer many sticks with a rubber coating offer the butt end of the stick. The only way to know what you like is to play with the sticks.  There are many brands of good drumsticks to compare, maybe you could think about your favorite artist's preference in sticks when choosing your own. Here are the top brands with some of their endorsers.   Ahead (Lars Ulrich, Rick Allen) - Ahead is favored by metal drummers due to the durability and weight of their sticks. However, many complain that the sticks hurt their hands.       ProMark (Joey Jordison, Mike Portnoy, Glenn Kotche, Benny Greb) - Promark lacks diversity in tip shapes, but offers some great finish options.       Vater (Chad Smith, David Silvera) - Vater is creates a product much like Vic Firths, but with different shapes.       Vic Firth (John Dolmayan, Vinnie Paul, Mark Guiliana) - Vic Firth offers probably the widest selection of sticks. They favor a light lacquer finish and many of their sticks are painted. ] Zildjian (Dave Grohl, Travis Barker)        , Especially if you're choosing a new kind of drumstick or a brand or size you haven't used before, ask if you can try them. Try them gently on a practice pad so that if you choose something else, the store can still sell them, but try them enough to get a feel for their weight, springiness, and balance.  

choose the right wood.  pick the right material.  choose the shape.  choose the thickness.  check the varnish or lacquer coating on the drumsticks.  choose your preferred brand.  try out the drumsticks. 

 Many medications can cause dry mouth, including drugs for pain management, depression or physical disorders in general, allergies, urinary incontinence, and high blood pressure.If you are on the medication long-term, ask a doctor about alternatives or a lower dosage.   Your label may use the medical term for dry mouth: xerostomia.  Try to go without these substances for a day or two and see if your symptoms improve.If you only have these occasionally, there is probably another cause for your symptoms. Still, lowering your intake may make your condition less severe.   Follow these links to get advice on how to quit smoking, stop drinking, or stay away from caffeine.  If you think you might be dehydrated, start drinking plenty of water or any other liquid even when you are not thirsty. Drink sports drinks as well to ensure you have enough electrolytes, which are vital for healthy fluid levels.If your dehydration is caused by vomiting, diarrhea, blood loss, severe burns, or excessive sweating, visit a doctor.  If your dry mouth is worse when you wake up, it could be caused by snoring. A humidifier may help by keeping the air moist at night, but consider talking to a doctor to find the cause of the snoring. Keep in mind that only an otolaryngologist will be able to examine in detail any potential cause, so you may want to ask your doctor for a referral to a specialist.   If you wake up feeling irritable or tired after a full night's rest, you may have sleep apnea. This is characterized by a long pause in your breathing, followed by a gasp or snore.  If none of the lifestyle changes above improve your condition, visit a doctor. Dry mouth can be a symptom of a serious medical condition.   If you have dry eyes as well, you may have Sjögren's Syndrome, a serious condition. Ask for medical tests to confirm this or find a different diagnosis.Let your doctor know if you are at risk for high blood pressure, diabetes, anemia, cystic fibrosis, arthritis, any head injury that might have caused nerve damage, or HIV/AIDS., Sjögren's Syndrome or radiation therapy for cancer in your head or neck can damage the cellular structure and functioning of the salivary glands. Scientists have managed to insert new genes into these glands, improving their function.This treatment needs more study and may not be widely available. Ask your doctor whether there are any clinical trials you can join, or other options that may improve the flow of saliva, such as medication.  

check the side effects of your medication.  avoid tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine.  treat dehydration.  prevent snoring.  visit a doctor if you can't find the cause.  ask about gene therapy for serious conditions. 

 Check your remote for a "PIP" button or read the instructions; most PIP TVs have a section devoted to its operation.; , PIP works only when more than one source is connected to the TV (i.e. cable & satellite, cable & "over the air" -- free, using set-top antenna -- channels, etc.).  With most TVs, pressing the "Input" or "Source" button on the remote will select from the various items you have plugged into the TV (again, satellite, cable, VCR). 

make sure your tv has it!,  find the source(s)!,  engage the pip by pressing the "pip" button; a small box should appear in one corner of the screen.  when you're dizzy from watching two things at once, press pip once again and the smaller box should go away.

 Whenever possible, try to have in-person meetings with current or potential business associates. Face-to-face interaction is crucial for building and maintaining relationships of any kind, business included.Meeting in-person allows you to notice body language and other non-verbal cues that would be harder to interpret over the phone or via email.; , Writing an old-fashioned note is a simple way to maintain business-to-business relationships. Unlike sending an e-mail, a card is an obvious, visible reminder of your thoughtfulness.Be sure to follow up on collaborative projects. Send a thank you note about your partnership and let the other party know you are always willing to collaborate again.  Whenever possible, interact via phone conversation rather than just through email. Taking the time to make a simple phone call can make all the difference in the world to a person you are in business with, especially in today’s fast-paced, email-oriented, technology-driven environment.When a business sends clients your way, acknowledge the gesture with a phone call. This is a great way to show your gratitude.  Listening well is part of maintaining any relationship that matters to you, especially business relationships. You want your business associates to feel like you hear what they are saying and that you think their opinion matters. This means giving them the floor to talk and letting them see that you are listening.Practice active listening skills like nodding your head, making eye contact, and giving short verbal responses to indicate that you are engaged in the conversation even when you aren’t speaking.  All relationships take time and effort to build and maintain. Business relationships are no different. You must make time for them, even when it’s inconvenient for you, so that they know you value their business.This means that you can’t just call someone up whenever you need them and ignore them when you don’t. You have to be willing to invest time and energy into your relationship even if it doesn’t seem to benefit you immediately. You will reap the benefits in the long run.  Try to be proactive about predicting the needs of the businesses you interact with on a regular basis. Continuously check in with company leaders to ensure that their needs are being met by your services. Don’t simply wait for them to contact you.Determine how you can best serve business clients and colleagues. Ask direct questions about your company's quality, products, and efficiency. Surveys, phone calls or a casual on-site visit are inexpensive ways to improve business-to-business relationships.  Instead of simply attempting to meet the needs of a client's short-term project, learn what the company might need in the future. Ask what new developments are in the works. Then get a timeline for pending product launches. Finally, determine how your business skills can increase their chances of success with the new projects.  A great way to expand your business relationships is to network through business associates you already have. Ask some existing business clients or associates to make introductions for you so that you can expand your business circle.Just be sure that you are willing to help others network in return. Maintaining business relationships is all about finding the balance of give and take. You have to be willing to give in order for others to be willing to give to you., When you learn of a colleague or business in need of services that someone you know can provide, offer to arrange an introduction between the two entities. If your business associates think of you as someone who helps them solve their problems (even when it might not directly benefit you), they will be more likely to remain in business with you.Before making a business-to-business referral, try to get a general understanding of the capabilities, needs, and budgets of both parties to avoid wasting anyone's time.  Collaboration can be a great way to build business relationships. Find out how to collaborate with competitors on certain projects. If your business owns a piece of machinery that you believe will add value to another company's services, approach the company owner to determine if you can work together.Invite the potential collaborator to lunch to talk about complimentary services and products.  Take the time to build a professional presence on social networking websites to share your background with others who may not be as familiar with your work. This will help get your business name out there and can reassure your existing business relationships.Using social media will help you reach a larger audience of people with your vision for your business and will give you a great starting point for building business relationships. Having an online presence makes it easier for new contacts (and existing ones) to find you and contact you.  

meet face-to-face.  send a handwritten card.  pick up the phone.  listen more than you talk.  nurture your relationships.  pay attention to the needs of your business associates.  see a client's big picture.  try networking.  make referrals.  try to collaborate on projects.  utilize social networking platforms to build larger business circles.

 Loose cubic zirconia stones are generally colorless, but many shades of colors can be added using trace elements during the manufacturing process.; , Clarity, or clearness, of loose cubic zirconia is a quality factor. The manufacturing process can sometimes cloud a stone, making visible imperfections. Just as with genuine diamonds, the clearer the stone is, the greater the value.  Cut is very important in determining the quality for loose cubic zirconia stones. Just as with diamonds, the cut reveals the stone's beauty through every facet. The facets must be even and precise to create just the right appearance. As with diamonds, the skill of the stone cutter makes all the difference because stone cutters do much more than cut. They analyze the stone carefully to determine how much of the stone should be cut off to give proper clarity. Then, they take many steps to perfect their cut without taking away from the stone.   The Brilliant cut is the standard There are other popular cuts such as the Trillion, Princess, and Radiant cuts. There are also a variety of shapes to give each stone its own unique personality.  

look at the color.  check the clarity.  check the cut.

 Solo chess is not a rapid game—it is a slow moving logic battle against yourself. Since the game will be played over the course of a few days or weeks, set up the board in a convenient location that others will not disturb. Place all of the pieces in their respective positions.   The back row of pieces is ordered from left to right as follows: Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King, Bishop, Knight, Rook. The white queen must be placed on a white square; the black queen must be placed on a black square. The front row of pieces contains eight pawns.; , Over the course of your solo game, you may find it difficult to keep track of whose turn it is. A small token, such as a coin or figurine, can help you keep track. Throughout the game, move the token from side to side to signify whose turn it is.   You can also just turn the entire board around so that you look at the board from the other side.  When you play yourself in chess, you are always aware of what your opponent—you—is thinking. It is tempting to use this advantage to skew the game towards one side or the other. Doing so, however, is not beneficial to your development as a player. In order to improve your skills through solo chess, you must remain indifferent about what side wins the game. Master chess players, while aware of their opponent’s strategy, always strive to make the best move possible., Just as in traditional chess, the player with the white pieces always opens the game. Select a white pawn to move forward one to two spaces. Switch sides and select a black pawn to move forward one to two spaces.   Try to avoid mirroring moves. Players generally move one of the pawns in front of the king or queen. This opens up a lane for the queen and bishops., Prior to moving your pieces, always pause for a moment to think.   Ask yourself several questions about your opponent’s strategy. “What is my opponent doing?” “How did my opponent’s last move impact the game?” “Is my opponent trying to set a trap?” After assessing the situation, formulate or adjust your strategy. First, search for moves that will threaten your opponent’s king or lead to the capture of one of their pieces. Second, determine if the move you want to make will leave your pieces vulnerable to capture. Lastly, double check your evaluation., Throughout the opening portion of the game, you want to position your pieces for future attacks. Prior to moving either queen, work to move the knights and bishops towards the center of the board. Doing so will put the knights and bishops in a position to attack your opponent’s pieces. Avoid moving too many of your pawns in an effort to capture the other player’s pawns., Castling is often the last action of your opening game. It is a move that relocates your king to a position of relative safety. In order to castle, all of the spaces between your unmoved king and an unmoved rook must be open. Slide your king two spaces towards the unmoved rook. Place the rook behind the king (between the king’s starting square and his new position).   If your opponent fails to castle, look for an opportunity to capture their king., The middlegame is devoted to strategically attacking your opponent. During this portion of the game, you must remain patient and aware of your opponent’s strategy. If your opponent fails to protect a piece, consider seizing the opportunity to capture it. Before you capture the piece:   Make sure you are not falling into a trap. Examine how the move will impact your pieces and the safety of your king., During the middlegame, you and your opponent will inevitably capture each other’s pieces. Essentially, you will be swapping pieces with your opponent. While some swaps will be necessary and logical, others may be detrimental to the strength of your men and the safety of your king. Before swapping pieces, consider if the piece you are capturing is as valuable as the piece you are sacrificing.   The queen is the most valuable piece, followed by the rooks. The bishops and knights are of equal value. Pawns have the least value to you., Once the manpower of each side has diminished, the endgame begins. Manipulate your pieces so that they threaten the safety of your opponent’s king. The goal of the endgame is to checkmate your opponent before they can checkmate you. When a king can not outrun a threat to its safety and the remaining men can not thwart the threat, the king is in check.  

set up the board.  find a token.  prepare yourself to remain unbiased.  make the first move for each side.  anticipate your opponent’s moves.  move out the knights and bishops.  castle.  attack your opponent.  cede your pieces wisely.  capture the king. 

 Broad beans are available in many different varieties, some more appropriate for your available space. Whether you want to grow broad beans in a small kitchen garden, or a big hoop house, there’s one that's right for the space.Some excellent and hardy varieties:   The Sutton grows only about 12" (30cm) high, making it an excellent choice for smaller gardens, hoop houses, and anywhere space is at a premium.       The Imperial Green Longpod produces huge 15" (40cm) pods, each containing several big beans and are noted for their flavor.       Stero are compact plants that produce heavily if picked regularly. The Stero beans are so sweet they can be eaten without cooking.       Red Epicure produce vibrant red beans that can offer a distinctive and exotic alternative to regular favas or broad beans.       Aquadulce Claudia has been around since the 1850s, winning awards for its flavor and hardiness. This variety is noted for being particularly good to overwinter. Plant Aquadulce Claudia in the winter or late autumn.      ; , Depending on where you live, you may want to plant your broad beans in the late autumn, after you've cleaned up your garden from the summer, which means you'll be harvesting them sometime in the spring when you're ready to start planting other plants. In regions with very cold winters, however, waiting until spring is essential.   Temperate zones: In most regions, you'll want to start broad beans in the early spring to ensure a late summer harvest. Broad beans like to be planted between 60℉ and 65℉ (15-18℃), and struggle in temperatures higher than 80℉ (27℃). Warm Mediterranean climates: Let plants winter-over in areas with mild winters. Fava beans can stay healthy down to temperatures of about 15 °F (−9 °C), making them a good candidate for overwintering in some climates. Because of the long maturation period, planting broad beans in late autumn can ensure that you’re harvesting in early spring. Cold or very hot zones: Start beans indoors in regions with sudden shifts in temperature. If you live in the American Midwest or the Southeast, the transition from winter to summer is often sudden enough that it puts a strain on broad bean varieties, making it a better choice to start your plants indoors, several weeks before putting them in the ground.  Whenever you're planting your beans, plant them in well-tilled soil that's been properly fertilized with the fertilizer of your choice. Since broad beans are nitrogen-producers, you don't necessarily need to fertilize. If you do, use a low-nitrogen fertilizer.   Pick a spot with good sun, away from any plants in the onion family, tilling the ground in the area you're planting several inches deep and working in compost.  Broad beans can grow in any kind of soil, as legumes are self-fertilizers. To help them convert nitrogen, however, it’s a good idea to use Rhizobia bacteria to promote growth and help the roots fix nitrogen. This black powder is available at any gardening store.Wet the seeds lightly and put them in a coffee can or a cup with the inoculant, then shake them gently to coat the seeds evenly before planting. Do this just a few minutes before you're ready to put the seeds in the ground.  Moisten your soil with water gently before planting. You don't want standing water, - just a bit of dampness to get started.   Use your finger to poke a hole about 2" (5 cm) deep in the ground. Place them 8" (20 cm) apart in double rows, with the same distance between the two rows. If you're planting a variety known for growing quite large, you might plant them with a bit more space between. Find the dark spot–the "eye" of the seed–and plant it downward. Some gardeners recommend planting twice as many seeds as you want plants, to allow for non-germinating seeds., If you need to start your beans indoors, a great way to start them is using empty toilet paper tubes, one tube for each plant you hope to grow. Use a seeding tray, available at any gardening store, to line up your tubes and start your broad beans.   Stand the tubes in the tray, fitting snugly. Fill the tubes ⅔ to ¾ full with potting soil. You'll probably spill some in between, but don't worry about the mess. Place one bean on top of the soil in each tube. If you have already germinated the seeds by soaking, place the seed root-down. Water the tubes gently from the top to compact the soil a bit, then fill each tube with a little more soil, covering the beans. Keep the tray at room temperature until the beans sprout, then move the tray to a sunny place. Cool temperatures are fine, just as long as the temperature doesn't dip too much below freezing for long.  The small bushes that the beans will grow on will quickly become laden with heavy pods, and will sag over without the proper support. For this reason, it's important to plant stakes along your broad bean row to use to support them when they start to gain height.   Use small dowels spaced every foot or two along the row, with twine tied between, to give the plants something to lean on. You can use twine, or old strips of bed-sheet to gently tie the plants and keep them upright and keep the pods off the ground. Don't wait until you've got a huge plant and it's flopping over to stake them. It's very easy to damage the roots and promote mildew if the plant spends too much time flopped over on the ground before getting staked up.  Broad beans can withstand dry spells, but keep the plants well-watered, especially if you live in an especially warm climate. Water the soil deeply in the coolest part of the day–first thing in the morning, or in the evening after dinner–and avoid over watering. You shouldn't see a bunch of standing water around your broad beans.   Avoid overhead watering, which is watering the tops of the plants and letting it drip down into the soil. This will promote mildew and other problems. Water the soil.  Broad bean roots are relatively shallow, making it very easy to accidentally uproot them if you're careless with a hoe. Weed around your broad beans by hand, keeping the area competition-free. Once the plant is established, you can lighten up on the weeding some.  The plant will keep growing and will overproduce unless you stunt the growth by pinching off the new sprouts at the top of the plant as soon as you seen pods producing. At this point, you can harvest some of the leaves to eat, which are a surprisingly tender salad green.   Pinch out the growing tips when you see young beans appearing at the base. Remove the tips with two leaves attached from the tops of the plants. If you don't want to eat them, compost them.  If you've got problems with rodents, groundhogs, rabbits, or other pests messing with your garden, broad beans would be a good candidate for row cover, if necessary. Row covers are plastic or cloth sheets that you can stake gently, draped over the plants. This leaves enough room for growth and air circulation, and also warmth.   Row covers can also be a great idea if you're planting in the autumn, because it will help trap the heat near the ground and protect the plants from frost. If you use a row cover, leave the rows uncovered for a while in the middle of the day, maybe while you're weeding to let the air circulate more readily. Watch for fungal disease and wet rot at the base of the plants. If you see any whitish or yellowish patches, water them less and expose the plants to more air.  Aphids love bean plants and will congregate usually at the top of the plants, near new shoots and buds. Some gardeners like to use insecticidal spray to keep aphids off the plants, but an easier method involves cutting the tops off the plants where the aphids congregate as you see them. If you're a diligent gardener, you should be able to pinch them off before they do much damage.  Like other bush beans, broad beans can be tender and edible in the first couple days of their formation, eaten like sugar snap peas, or steamed whole as a side dish. Broad beans are notable for the waxy outer shell on each bean, but harvested young those outer shells will be soft and edible.   Look for a narrow pod that’s bright green. The pods should be thin and narrow, showing none of the bulges that are the sign of mature beans on the inside. If beans are showing, let them mature fully. Don't over-pick your young beans, since the full-grown variety is where the flavor's at. It's ok to pick a few from each plant if you can't wait, but save the majority for full maturation.  Broad beans are ready to be harvested when the pods and plump and the beans are fat and distinct in each pod. The pods will appear to plump some and begin to droop with the weight of the seeds when they're ready to harvest.   Depending on what variety you're growing, pods can be anywhere from 6 to 15 inches long, with several large, fat beans on the inside, with several pods per plant. If you pick them regularly throughout the season, you should open up space for more production as well, if you're had a good growing season, weather-wise.  To get at the broad beans, you've got to shuck them out of their pods. Holding each pod with the pointy tip up, pull the string along the side of each bean to open the pod.   Again, depending on the variety, each bean should have 5-10 large beans in each pod, which have a thick waxy shell that needs removed before eating. It takes some work, but getting organized can help to make the process go fast.The easiest way to do this is to blanch them, dropping the beans in boiling water for a count of five, then removing them immediately with a slotted spoon and putting them right into ice water. This will loosen the shells on each bean.  The best way to eat broad beans is the most simple: steam them and serve them simply dressed with salt and pepper. They're big, meaty, and delicious, ideally paired with red meat. They're also a great base for bean soups, or as an addition to hearty salads.  Because broad bean plants are great nitrogen-providers, it's a good idea to return them back to the soil and let their nutrients enrich the soil. Cut each plant down to the base and dig the roots into the soil. Cover them in soil and rotate your garden so something in need of nitrogen-enrichment is planted there next season.  

select a variety of broad bean to try.  pick a date to sow your beans based on the climate.  prepare the ground with fertilizer.  consider inoculating the seeds to promote growth.  direct sow your seeds or starts in well-tilled, moist soil.  start plants indoors in colder climates.  stake the plants as they start to gain height.  water sparingly and deeply.  weed aggressively, especially if you’re wintering the plants.  when the plant starts producing pods, pinch off new sprouts.  consider using a row cover.  watch out for aphids.  harvest some early to eat them whole.  harvest mature beans when the pods are bright and not over-bulging.  shuck the beans.  enjoy the beans in soups, salads, and other dishes.  return the whole plant to the soil when the beans finish. 

 Keep it short and simple. Yes, this the first rule. When the web user views the URL it should convey the correct details like the page content idea, page hierarchy and more details. So remember to keep it short (so that it easy to remember), and simple (so that it is easy to locate).; , Nowadays most advanced search engines like google considers URL as an essential criteria in search algorithm out of various other factors. For example an URL like www.domainname.com/1738.html will be considered as a less search friendly URL when compared to www.domainname.com/computer-parts/keyboard.html. As you can see the latter conveys the hierarchy of the page – the page talks about computer parts and specifically about keyboard. Also it is easier for the search engine crawling.  Now taking the same example in Step 2, the second URL is rich in keywords. Keyword in URL is more search friendly. As you can see, the URL contains two major keywords, which are, computer parts and keyboard.  While we have multiple words in the URL, for example, web development strategy, we need to use separators such as hyphens or underscores. /web-development-strategy.php. Here it is better to use hyphens than using underscores.  Mostly it is a Myth that Uppercase alphabets attract more attention(pertaining to URL Framing). But it is advisable to use lowercase for all the alphabets in the URL. Keep this pattern uniform in all your URLs.  When you have folders and sub folders, categorize them in an orderly fashion.

Also for the user, he knows which part of the website he is currently located.  While creating blog for a website it is better to have it as a sub-folder (www.domainname.com/blog) rather than sub-domain(www.blog.domainname.com). A sub-folder is more search friendly.

 While many gardeners choose spring for time to move and divide plants, it can have a negative effect on the plants, especially in hotter climates. It's preferable to divide hostas in the late summer and early fall, roughly 4 weeks before first frost. Hostas are fairly tough plants, though, and can be divided at any time during the growing season if you carefully replant, water, and mulch the divided clumps. Tamping down the soil around the root ball so that the plant can't be easily dislodged will insure greater success.; , Often, if the clumps are large (say about 25cm/10 inches across at the base), you will find it easiest to use a fork with flat blades and a spade or shovel. If the soil is very light and humus-y, and the plants are smaller, a long-bladed knife, preferably with a serrated blade, will work well. A hacksaw is very helpful if the clump is very large. Some folks like to have a garden hose handy, or a large bucket of clean water.  Once you have cut a circle around the clump, slide the spade underneath the clump and lift it out of the ground, or pry the clump from the ground with the fork.  Also wash the plant if you are unsure of how the individual plants are growing and you don't want to slice one in half (particularly if the hosta is a slow-growing expensive one). Do not worry about damaging the roots with the water, because hostas' roots are tough.  To remove a stem from the crown, use a back and forth pulling motion and not a side-wise motion (hold the core plant in one hand, and grab the stem in the other, rotate the stem-holding back and forth), work the stem back and forth until the rhizome comes loose or breaks from the crown. The rhizome will break at the appropriate point. Even if you lose some of the plant stems, you'll still have enough of the rhizomes to produce a healthy new clump.  You can cut the clump in various sizes, such as simply in half, into thirds, or quarters.  Try to keep as many roots and leaves as possible, by making cuts through the crown but not into the roots. Start by cutting the crown in half, if you are really careful you can navigate around the stems; if the clump is really large, sometimes it is just easier to cut in half without much concern that you cut a few stems in half, because the clump is such a monster anyway.  In this case, hold each half in one hand, and gently rotate the halves in opposite directions, then rotate back and forth each time applying a bit more pressure and simultaneously exerting pressure to move the halves away from each other. If you can't pull it apart then make the cut deeper. ,,, Do not think that a small piece might not grow. It's amazing how resilient these plants are and you might as well plant the little pieces alongside a larger plant.  If you can not plant them right away, place some moist dirt or peat moss on the roots and put them away from direct sunlight, deep shade is good in hotter climes.  Do not leave the plants in water for more than a day, the roots will begin to rot.  If you have washed the roots or the roots are not holding much soil, make a good size hole and spread the roots out in a fan. Replace the soil, pressing firmly with the heel of your hand around the plant, and water the plants well so no large air pockets in the soil exist.  deeper) and water in well. 

choose the right time of year.  get the right tools for your soil.  cut or dig around the hosta plant, starting 10cm/4 inches from the base of a small plant, to 35cm/18 inches for a very large clump.  if you are new at dividing hostas or other perennials, washing the dirt off the clump can be very helpful to see the individual plants and their rhizomes (from where the roots grow).  if possible, particularly if the hosta is not a large clump, separate the individual plants by hand, by gently forcing your thumbs between plant's stems, and easing the stems apart.  if the clump is very large, it may just be easier to use a serrated kitchen knife, to cut through the clump.  start by spreading the roots so that you determine where you want to cut.  if possible, make the cut about halfway through the crown and then see if you can pull it apart by hand; use the same back and forth pulling motion.  washing between cuts to remove sand and small rocks can also improve your insight into how the plant's stems are growing, and to see where to cut or pull apart.  ,  you can also use the hacksaw to cut through the clump, by turning the clump on its side, but be careful that the saw doesn't get stuck, so prevent that by forcing the plant apart, either with your other hand or perhaps the handle of another garden tool, if the clump is huge and the saw is pretty deep into the clump.  ,  remove some older, larger leaves or cutting the foliage back at the time of dividing will reduce water loss and help to minimize shock.  ,  plant the divided plants.  do not let the roots dry out too much.  if the plants' roots dry some before you get a chance to replant, soak the plant in a bucket of water for two to twelve hours.  for stem divisions resulting from pulling plants apart and which have a nice balanced root distribution, plant these divisions at their original level, so that the white basal portions of the stems are just under the ground and you cannot see them.  if you had to use the knife or hacksaw to cut the clump, plant these smaller now-divided clumps at the same height as they were growing, or just slightly deeper (1/3cm/1 to 1-1/2 in.  keep newly divided hostas wet; keep plants from drying out for the first two weeks.  

; , Note what you can see at each of the corners. Flick your eyes from corner to corner to corner and look carefully, so that when you take the viewfinder down, you can still see the parameter of the image that you will be working on in your mind's eye. , Quarter it vertically and horizontally, so that it is split in half both ways. This breaks down the complexity of the image that is in front of you into four smaller elements that are going to be easier to control.  This is an information gathering exercise; you are making a map from observation of what will be the painting. Think in terms of the design, the pattern and the overall composition. This step gives you thinking time before you set about the process of painting and transferring the image to the painting surface.  

purchase or make a viewfinder.  look through your viewfinder.  roughly draw the same proportions as the aperture of the viewfinder on your sketchbook paper.  ,  divide the space into quarters.  start from the bottom right quarter. 

 When girls are at the mall, they’re engulfed in a world of fashion so they will be more likely to check out what you’re wearing. Make sure you come to the mall dressed in a stylish outfit that accents your best features. Wear something that is your style, but make sure not to wear anything that has lots of stains or looks dirty.Wear a shirt color that matches or complements your eye color. This will help accentuate your eyes and make them pop. Classic pants like dark denim or khaki are a good option to appear stylish.; , Before approaching a girl at the mall you want to make sure you look your best. Head to the bathroom to check out how you look. Make sure you don’t have any food on your mouth or shirt. Use a brush or your fingers to brush your hair and smooth over any stray hairs that might be sticking out.  One way to get a girl to remember you is to wear a hint of scent on your body. Use one spritz of cologne or perfume to give yourself a subtle scent that will stay on the girl’s mind. Make sure you don’t put on too much or she might be turned off. Stick to one to two sprays max.  Using eye contact to flirt with a girl is a great way to get her paying attention to you. Play an eye flirting game.Glance in her direction and wait for her to look over at you. When she does, turn away and look at something else. Do the same thing again, but this time wait a little longer before turning away. Continue until it’s obvious you’re looking at her and then go up to talk to her. Say something like, “Hi, I just had to come talk to you. I could see how beautiful your eyes are from all the way over there.”  , If you see a girl your want to pick up in a store, try going up to her and asking for fashion advice. Grab a shirt off the rack and approach her with it. Hold it up to your face and ask her if she thinks it looks good with your eyes. Saying something like this will make her think you appreciate her knowledge and get her to look you in the eyes. Once she gives her answer you can continue the conversation. Try saying “Thanks. Wow, you have beautiful eyes. I bet everything in this store would look good with your eyes!”, A great way to pick up a girl at the mall is to be upfront and approach her directly. Directly telling a girl that you find her attractive can be intimidating, but it can also be very rewarding.Go up to her and say something like, “I’m sorry to interrupt you, but I just had to come over here to tell you how beautiful you are. You light up this entire room with your beauty!" When you approach her directly, be calm and just act like yourself. If you feel awkward, say that. You could tell her, “Hey, I feel awkward saying this, but I wanted to tell you that I think you are incredibly beautiful.”  , If the girl you want to pick up is with a group of friends, approach the entire group first and then speak directly to her.You could say, “Excuse me ladies, sorry to interrupt your fun, but I just had to come over here to introduce myself to your friend.” Then, say your approach line to the girl you want to pick up. Next say, “Hi, I’m Matt and I just needed to come tell you that you light up this entire mall with your smile. You must have a beautiful soul because you radiate with beauty.”  , When you approach a girl, she may be a little suspicious at first, so don’t immediately ask her for her number or give her yours. Let the approach lead you to a conversation with her. Talk to her for a while so that she’ll feel comfortable and get to know you a bit. She’ll be more likely to want to see you again if she feels like she knows you a bit., One of the best ways to seal the deal and get a girl’s phone number is to be confident and calm the entire time you are talking to her. If you are really anxious or self conscious, the girl will pick up on it, get a negative vibe from you, and most likely not give you her number. If you feel nervous, take a deep breath and try to fake the confidence. Imagine you’re just talking to a friend instead of a girl you like., At the end of your conversation, ask if you can exchange numbers with the girl to possibly see her again. Ask her to enter her number in your phone and you can to the same with hers, or you can call or send a quick text so your number is on her phone.Say something like, “I’m sorry to end this, but I have to be going. I’ve really enjoyed talking to you, and I’d love to do it again sometime. Let’s exchange numbers so we can meet up for coffee sometime.”  , The great thing about picking up a girl at the mall is that you don’t have to go far to have a first mini date. After talking to a girl for a bit, go out on a limb and ask her if she’d like to join you for coffee or lunch at a place in the mall. Tell her you want to hear more about her and would love to buy her a coffee.  

wear a stylish outfit.  look at yourself in the mirror.  wear a signature scent.  flirt with your eyes.  ask her for fashion advice.  approach her directly.  address her friends.  make conversation first.  be confident in yourself.  ask to exchange numbers.  invite her to coffee at the mall. 

 This applies to your clothes, shoes, hair, and (for girls) makeup. Although self-expression is healthy, there is a time and place to wear outlandish clothes. For example, it goes without saying that you are washed and clean - if you have greasy hair or body odor, take a shower. Be mindful of those around you and avoid excessive perfume, cologne, or other aerosol products. Do you think He has more power or right than the President? Would you dress up to meet the President? In that case, dress nicely when you go to church to meet Him as well.   Women, make sure that nothing is revealing. If you are afraid to genuflect because 'something might show', then it is not appropriate. Don't wear shoes that you cannot walk in, don't have a crazy hairdo, too much perfume, or overdone makeup. Men, please don't wear your belt around your knees, keep cologne to a minimum, and stay away from your ragged yet beloved sneakers.Shave, and keep your hair neat.; , It is very important to stay quiet. Make sure that you arrive early: Latecomers disrupt the service and interrupt others' thoughts and/or prayers. During the quiet time before mass, volunteers might recite the Rosary, or it might just be some private prayer time. Either way, be sure to stay quiet.  Unless it is cold/flu season or you have microphobia , please shake hands and greet those around you warmly when appropriate - most places of worship have a time dedicated to this at the beginning of mass.  Once again, this is a sign of respect both to others and to Him. Although it might get boring, keep your thoughts on God. At the very least, act interested and don't distract others. Be mature if the sermon has to do with sexual activity or another uncomfortable topic. If customary and you feel comfortable, sing during the songs to connect in a special way to Jesus and the congregation.  This is common knowledge, but people often unintentionally stand on both sides of the pews, blocking entrance and creating some awkward moments. Be mindful of where you sit.  

dress in a modest and mature way.  arrive at church five to ten minutes early, bless yourself, and genuflect before sitting quietly in a pew.  shake hands with those around you during the greeting.  pay attention and participate during the service.  don't block people coming in and out of the pew. 

 If you don't know much about depression, it's harder to recognize if your family member really is depressed. It's not hard to learn a lot about depression. There are websites, books, magazine and newspaper articles, and of course, many doctors. Look it up and determine what type of depression your family member has or may have. Look over the symptoms, various medications and other treatments. The more you know, the easier it is to help.; , Although you may think that the last thing your relative wants to do is talk to you about depression, you could be wrong. Sometimes a friend just needs someone to talk to. Actively listen without judging or giving advice. Depression is an issue that people sometimes feel they must hide, in order to maintain their usual life. Either that or they are only just coming to terms with it themselves, let alone the idea of letting other people in on it. However, from time to time, your relative may open up, or express the desire to talk to you. When this happens, be understanding and kind. Don't interrupt, don't try to convince them they're wrong, and try not to react in horror. It can be difficult to hear about how terrible your friend feels, but remember that they're trusting you. Value this trust and keep it close.  Tell the person suffering from depression that you've noticed that they seem down or depressed lately.  Did they just have a bad break-up or did their parents get divorced? Ask them if there is anything you can do to help. Ask carefully and gently, don't get upset if they're slow to tell you. Some people take longer than others to talk. If they say they don't have a reason, it's probably true.  Every person's story is different, and so it is impossible to completely understand. However, keeping an open mind and putting yourself in your friend's shoes can help you come closer to them. Once you've done your research, you should know a lot more about depression. Apply the symptoms and emotions to yourself, and contemplate how you would feel if this was happening to you. Call upon things your friend has done or told you, and try to understand why and what they mean. In times of need, having someone understand can be all the relief in the world.  This trivializes their pain and will not help.  Because depression is heavy, slow moving and unpredictable, it can frustrate and even anger those who are trying to help. Remember that depression is a complex disease, and try to understand that the depressed person is not herself or himself right now. If your relative doesn't seem to appreciate your efforts, or is pushing you away, don't walk off in a temper. Give them space or give them comfort if they need it, and be there for them, no matter how much they believe you don't need to be.  Depression is not something that goes away by itself after a while. This is probably the most difficult step. Sometimes, a depressed person is more than happy to talk about it, go to a therapist, have people know, and start the healing process. But other times, they will argue, refuse, deny things, and often get angry and defensive. It is a serious mental illness. However, just because your friend doesn't want you to get involved, it doesn't justify you standing there and letting the problem get worse. Be sensible. If your friend is sounding like they are harming themselves or are thinking of suicide, you need to alert somebody.Encourage the person to start with a family doctor or local mental health associations. Offer to help them find resources or counseling services.  And you MUST know it IS a disease. Chemicals in the brain have become unbalanced for whatever reason and an "outsider" can no more expect a diabetic to cure him/herself than they can expect (or tell) a person with depression to "pick themselves up; you have a great life". And, trying to show them how they DO have a great life or how someone else "is much worse off than they are" is BAD advice. Repeat BAD. While you may think you are doing the rational, correct thing, you are not. Why? Because the person with depression will think "they're right...I do have a good life or that person IS much worse off than I am...BUT...I still can't feel better. LOOK AT ME! I'm a true weakling who has no reason to be depressed. Now I feel even worse because I can't get myself out of this and because I don't have anything to be depressed about". Then, things go from bad to worse. Listening and expressing your concern and sympathy is best. Get them to try to find a good counselor (it may take a few tries)....to try medication (and stick with it for at least 3 weeks...although that long a time is an absolute LIFETIME to the depressed)...give them things to look forward to each day or every other day...prayer...and, sadly, just plain old "time". This disease takes it's own sweet time to get flushed out of one's brain.  That was it. That simple phrase. I had a good cry for a couple minutes and then I started to feel a bit better. For me, it was actually hearing someone NOT try to solve this disease for me with "rational" comments...it was just knowing of his care and concern for me in my illness that helped me more than any professional counseling or medication. Sometimes it happens that way...simple caring is always best.  

research.  listen.  acknowledge.  find out why your relative is depressed.  try to understand.  don't tell your elderly relative that life is still worth living and that this situation will improve and the sadness will get better.  be patient.  advise them to seek professional help.  bottom line (and this is from a depression sufferer): this is an evil disease.  the best thing i heard during one depression period was from a friend who sincerely and simply said "man, i feel so bad for you." 

 Body mass index (BMI) is age and sex specific, so it is often called BMI-for-age. Use a bathroom scale to measure your child’s weight. Then, measure your child’s height with a tape measure. Have your child stand against a wall, mark the top of their head with a pencil, and measure their height with a tape measure. Finally, divide the child’s weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared.If you prefer working in feet and inches, you can divide the child’s weight in pounds by their height in inches squared and then multiply it by 703.You can also use an online BMI calculator, but make sure it is specifically for children and teenagers— such as the one here: https://nccd.cdc.gov/dnpabmi/calculator.aspx — and not for adults. Simply fill in the required information on size, weight, age and all other fields. Then press calculate. Download charts that show BMI-for-age. Go to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, and search BMI-for-age. You will see charts that are available for free to download for both boys and girls. Compare your child’s BMI to what is normal for their age, height, and sex.A child whose BMI is equal to or greater than the 5th percentile and less than the 85th percentile is considered a healthy weight for their age. Most pediatricians also measure and track BMI at regular check-ups and can provide you with the information and/or charts.; , Your doctor will measure the fat around your child’s belly. They will measure the circumference at the natural waist, which is in between the lowest rib and the top of the hip bone. This method is inexpensive and fairly accurate; however, some doctors may not be able to tell you whether your child is overweight from this information alone., Your doctor will measure your child’s abdominal obesity. They will measure the circumference of your child’s waist and then their hips. They will then divide your child’s waist by hip measurements. There are two places where your doctor could possibly measure wrong but they should be able to do it fairly accurately., Your doctor will use a caliper to measure the thickness of a pinch of skin or fat in various parts of the body. They may measure the trunk, thighs, front and back of the upper arm, and then under the shoulder blade. Doctors will then use an equation to predict overall body fat percentage. It is a fast and easy method, which is safe and inexpensive. However, it is not as accurate as other methods., Your doctor will send a safe electrical current through your child’s body. The current encounters more resistance passing through fat than through water and muscle. Your doctor will use an equation to measure body fat percentage. It is convenient, safe, and relatively inexpensive. It relies on relatively normal ratio of body water to fat, but this can change during illness or otherwise. It is not as accurate as some other methods.Your doctor may use one or more methods to measure body fat, alongside the body mass index, to determine whether or not your child is overweight.  looking at the pattern of growth, including weight, is more important than looking at one value. Looking at how the weight has changed over time can be very important when determining if your child is overweight. Certain factors, such as entering puberty, can have a bearing on whether your child is at a healthy weight. Your doctor can look at BMI measurements from previous visits to determine whether your child may be at risk for becoming overweight., You should focus on having an upbeat and informative conversation about healthy eating habits such as relatively small and diverse portions. Throughout the conversation, you should communicate your love and support. Make sure they know it is not their fault and that obesity is a complex issue. Avoid words like greedy, fat, or lazy, which will erode self-esteem.If the child is under nine years of age, make changes to the family diet as a whole. You don’t need to talk to your child. Rather, change what the family eats.If your child is 10 or older, you may want to talk to them directly about food and weight. They will likely already be thinking about these topics so now is the time for open dialogue.You must still make changes as a family, however, even for older children.  If you see your child making good food decisions such as finishing their healthy dinner or skipping a sugary snack, you should offer praise. Encourage them to continue making wise food choices.   For example, if you see your child make a healthy salad for lunch, you might say: “That looks both healthy and delicious. It is great to see you figuring out recipes that work for you. You’ll have to teach me how to make it!”  , If you notice your child gaining weight and want to say something, it is best to avoid saying negative things to your child.   For example, if you pick your child up from school and you notice their weight in comparison to their peers, try to avoid making negative comments. Avoid saying things like, “Wow, you really have put on some pounds these last few months!” These kinds of negative statements harm your child’s self-esteem.  Criticizing or fretting over your child's weight/appearance won't help their mental health, and it may lead to a defeatist "I'm fat and awful" attitude. Instead, talk about good habits. Emphasize that people of all sizes can make good choices and take good care of their health.   Avoid equating looks to health. Some Olympic athletes are very heavy, and some thin people have bad habits. If your child is heavy, let them look at pictures of athletes who are heavy too. This shows them that people who look like them can get fit and make healthy choices.  You can talk to your child about weight and health while making home recipes or visiting the grocery store. Throughout these conversations, try to empower your child to make healthy food choices.Discuss food preparation with your child. For instance, you might bring them to the grocery store and talk about the different options for weekly meals. Talk to your child about healthy recipes. Ask your child, "How do you think we could make this recipe a little bit healthier?" If you raise the issue in this manner, it shifts the focus from their body to a common recipe. , Prioritize family eating in the home. You should aim for eating fewer calories and reducing unhealthy things like salt and saturated fats. You should also aim to increase the number of fruits and vegetables in your family dinners.Feed your children fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains. Children who eat fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes will grow up healthier and live longer. Base your diet on plant foods as opposed to animal products.While you don't want the emphasis to be on animal products, it is still important to include lean proteins in your family's diet. Prepare lean cuts of meat (such as white-meat, skinless poultry) and choose low-fat dairy products. Talk to your doctor or a dietitian if you need help planning a healthy diet for your child and family.  Causes of childhood obesity include inappropriate diets with excessive saturated fats, and simply too much food. For some, there is a genetic or metabolic component behind their obesity as well. Once you have determined a new family meal plan, you will need to involve everyone in the changes.   It will be easier to make the changes when everyone is involved, including you, and when everyone understands the importance of dietary change. It can be hard to change old habits, so stick with it until the new, healthier habits feel normal.Be fair. Don't subject one child to tougher standards than another child, or they will resent you.  Reducing childhood sugar consumption leads to major health benefits, including obesity reduction.Be mindful of juice purchases. Some juices have a lot of added sugar, which isn't a good choice.Look for 100% juice, if any.  Encourage activity to happen as a family, or for smaller groups. For example, maybe you'd like to take your daughter out for walks after lunch every day.   Visit the local park or swimming pool. Dance to music. Take walks around the neighborhood. Go for family bike rides. Play backyard sports.  Different children have different tastes, and your goal is not to force them into whatever exercise plan you created, but to find a type of exercise that is fun and healthy.   Extroverted children may prefer group sports, while introverted children might like one-on-one or individual activities. Don't keep score if it stresses out your child. Some kids find it more fun to play without keeping track of who is winning. Children, especially heavy children, may get bullied in organized sports. If your child has an awful time, they might start hating exercise altogether. Listen to your child, and take them seriously if they say they're being bullied or they want to quit.  Children love to play, so if you can find toys that get them moving, they can have a lot of fun exercising. Consider both outdoor and indoor opportunities. If you have the financial resources, try buying things like these:   Video games like Dance Dance Revolution Indoor trampolines Balls for sports (kickballs, basketballs, baseballs and bats; department stores sell cheap colorful balls that work for different sports) Scooters/skateboards (with the appropriate safety gear) Step counters (challenge them to beat a certain number)  , You are a role model for them in life, so you should take care of your own health., Children who regularly exercise tend to perform better academically and have lower levels of stress.   Sign your children up for sports teams, if they're interested. Sign your children up for swimming lessons.  

figure out your child’s weight-to-height ratio (or body mass index).  have your doctor measure your child’s waist circumference.  ask your doctor to measure your child’s waist-to-hip ratio.  request a skinfold thickness measurement.  ask your doctor to perform a bioelectrical impedance test.  talk to your doctor about emerging patterns.  talk to your child about healthy eating habits.  praise your child for healthy eating and lifestyle choices.  avoid criticizing your child’s appearance.  focus on choices and habits, rather than looks or numbers on a scale.  discuss healthy recipes and food choices with your child.  use articles or news stories to talk about the importance of a healthy diet.if you see a magazine article about a healthy recipe or diet, you can use the article as an opportunity to talk to your child about healthy eating habits.  ,  start a new family meal plan.  involve the whole family in improving the family's meals.  cut down on sugary snacks.sugary snacks are widely available in schools and in many homes.  start new family activities that get the whole family outside.engaging your whole family in a healthy lifestyle will create the conditions for your children to develop into healthy adults.  find types of exercise that your kids actually enjoy.  buy games that involve physical activity.  model a healthy lifestyle for your children.your children will follow your direction.  start a daily exercise program with your children. 

 This recipe for celery salad is relatively simple and can be made in as few as 15 minutes. You can speed the preparation of this dish along by buying pre-chopped ingredients. For this dish, you'll need:  Black pepper Celery hearts (x3) Chives (1 small bunch, chopped) Croutons Cutting board Green romaine (1 head) Italian parsley (1 cup, chopped) Knife Kosher salt Parmesan cheese (½ cup, grated) Radishes (x4) Red leaf lettuce (1 head) Red wine vinegar (3 tbsp) Serving bowl (large) Sugar (2 tsp) Walnut oil (or substitute extra virgin olive oil/a nut oil; 4 tbsp), Bacteria, dirt, or leftover pesticide may remain on your veggies. Rinse all veggies thoroughly under cool water, then pat each dry with either a clean dishcloth or paper towel.  If you're not in a rush and want to save paper towel, you could spread your veggies on a clean surface and allow them to air dry., First, wash and dry your hands to prevent yourself from accidentally contaminating the clean lettuce. Pull its leaves apart by hand, then tear each leaf into bite-sized pieces. Do this for both the red leaf lettuce and romaine.  As you tear up the lettuce, you can add it directly into your large serving bowl., If you did not buy your parsley pre-chopped, lay it out on a clean cutting board and use your knife to chop one cup of this ingredient. Add this to your serving bowl, then do the same for your chives, if necessary. After that:  Slice each of your four radishes thinly. Add these to your serving bowl once they are sliced. Use your knife to shave thin slices from your celery hearts. As soon as you finish, add this ingredient to your serving bowl as well., In a small bowl, whisk your oil and vinegar thoroughly. Then add the sugar and continue to whisk until the sugar dissolves. After that, taste the dressing to check its flavor. You may need to add oil, vinegar, or sugar to adjust its flavor to your preferences., Toss your salad to spread the vegetables evenly throughout the salad. Take your dressing and evenly distribute it on top of the salad. Season the salad with salt and pepper to taste.  To prevent croutons from getting soggy, you should hold off adding these until just before you serve the salad. 

gather your celery salad ingredients.  rinse your veggies.  tear up your lettuce.  cut up the rest of your veggies.  prepare your dressing.  drizzle your dressing on the salad and enjoy. 

 Be conservative and only change the color of your natural hair by a few shades. This will ensure that you stay true to a color that matches your skin tone and that you aren’t shocked by the results.; , Assess your budget and do research online to see what brands are recommended within your price range. A good product can make all the difference when you want your hair to look professionally done.  Find a space with as much natural light as possible, and get all the materials out on the counter so you don’t spill or fumble.  Having an extra set of eyes and hands will ensure that your hair is dyed evenly.  By not shampooing your hair right before you dye, you are allowing the natural oils to protect your scalp.  Every box of hair dye has different instructions, so even if you have dyed your hair before, you should still follow along carefully.  Before you begin, test the dye on a small strand of hair. This will allow you to make sure that you like the color and to figure out how long you need to leave the dye in.  This will keep you from accidentally dyeing your skin. , Clip all but one section back at a time. Using the smaller divisions means its less likely that you will miss a spot. , As soon as your hair has been coated evenly, start the clock. This is usually about 20 minutes for most dyes.  This allows your hair to fully absorb and lock in the color.  Use a deep conditioning treatment at least once a week to keep up the color and shine of your hair.

 On most commercial patterns, the pattern is located in the top left corner. This number is used to identify the pattern design and size. Smaller pattern companies may replace the pattern number with a name., Sewing patterns are not one size fits all. Each pattern comes in multiple size ranges. Before purchasing a pattern, check the size range located to the right of the pattern number to make sure your size falls within the range., Pictures and or drawings of the garment will appear on the front of the pattern envelope. In addition to selling the garment, the images provide inspiration for fabric selection and information on how the garment is intended to fit. The images also depict design variations. The pattern contains the pieces necessary to create all of the variations., The design variations, also called “views,” also appear on the back of the envelope. These line drawings include more design details, such as darts, seam lines, and potential lengths. Each view is identified by a symbol, typically a letter. The symbol is used in charts and the pattern to identify information about that specific view., The back of the pattern envelope contains a list of fabrics suitable for this garment. Read through the list carefully. Select a fabric that is appropriate for the garment and that you are comfortable working with., In addition to fabric, your pattern may require notions and trims. The “Notions” section will list all of the additional pieces you will need to complete the garment. These may include items such as zippers, hook and eye closures, and elastic., Pattern sizing rarely aligns with ready to wear sizes. When cutting the pattern, you will follow lines for a specific size. Therefore, it is essential to accurately determine your size instead of assuming that you are a certain size.Use a measuring tape to measure various points on your body listed on the pattern envelope, such as your chest or bust, waist, and hips. Match your measurements to the measurements provided on the chart to determine your pattern size., The fabric requirements are listed directly below the body measurement and size charts. Locate the row containing the design variation you intend to create. Follow the row over until you reach the column containing your pattern size. The number in this cell is the amount of yardage you will need to complete the garment in your pattern size.   Most patterns will list alternative lengths for different widths of fabrics (45 inches wide v. 60 inches wide)., The last box in the chart contains information on the finished garment measurements. The finished garment will be slightly larger than your body measurements to allow for ease, or the fabric added to a garment so you may wear it comfortably. This information is often printed onto the pattern as well., The first page of the instruction booklet depicts images of the garment and its design variations. The line drawings show the front and the back of the garment. Under each drawing, you will once again find the garment’s corresponding symbol, typically a letter., Manufacturers often include line drawings of all the pattern pieces. Each image will be labeled, typically with a number. The number corresponds to a descriptive list located below the line drawings.   After reading the rest of the instructions, you may wish to mark which pattern pieces you will need., Prior to cutting and constructing your garment, devote time to reading the general sewing instructions thoroughly. This section contains information that may prevent you from making construction errors. It will provide you with details on items such as seam allowance and zipper insertion., Every design variation is accompanied with a corresponding cutting diagram. The layout depicts how all of the pattern pieces fit on the allotted amount of fabric.When viewing the diagram, make note of the following:   The grain line. The grain of the fabric runs parallel to the selvages of the fabric—the selvages are the finished edges of the fabric.. Each pattern piece will contain a line of arrows that corresponds to the grain line. Bent grainline symbols. If a grainline symbol is bent at the top, this means the piece should be placed on a fold. Double layer of fabric. A pattern may call for a specific piece to be cut out of a double layer of fabric., Unfold the pattern and lay it out on a flat surface. Retrieve your instruction book and turn to the cutting layout guide for your pattern. Use the cutting diagram to help you identify the pieces you will need for your garment.   The pattern pieces diagram may also be useful., Set your iron on low. Once the iron is preheated, iron the pattern. This will get rid of any wrinkle and folds in the paper. Carefully cut out each of the pieces at the correct size from the piece of pattern paper., Patterns contain various symbols. After cutting the pieces, familiarize yourself with the symbols printed on the pattern:   Single, heavy line: this is a cutting line. Double parallel lines: these lines are used to lengthen or shorten a garment. Triangles: triangular notches indicate where one piece will join with another piece. Dots: these empty or filled circles indicate where seams start and stop., Prior to cutting the pattern, you must properly prepare the fabric. Wash, dry, and iron the fabric. Fold your fabric as instructed in the pattern. Lay out your washed and ironed fabric on a flat surface—the wrong side of the fabric should face up unless specified otherwise.   Always double check to make sure your fabric is machine washable., Flip the instructions open to the cutting diagram for your garment. Place and pin the pieces onto the fabric as described and shown in the cutting diagram. Before cutting, make sure your pieces are properly aligned with the grainline of the fabric., Retrieve a pair of sewing scissors. Carefully cut out the pattern. Rotate the fabric as needed. 

locate the pattern number.  identify the sizes available in the pattern.  study the pictures and design variations.  view the design drawings.  read the fabric suggestions.  read the notion and trim requirements.  study the body measurement and size chart.  asses the fabric requirements.  note the finished garment measurements.  view the line drawings.  study the pattern pieces.  read the general sewing instructions.  study the cutting layout for your garment.  locate the pattern pieces required for your garment.  iron the pattern and cut out the size you need.  identify the symbols on the pattern pieces.  prep your fabric.  arrange the pieces on your fabric.  cut the pattern. 

 Before you steam your face, clean it thoroughly.   Before washing your face, it's a good idea to wash your hands first. Wet your hands and lather them in soap. Then, scrub for 20 seconds, making sure to wash between your fingers, under your nails, and on the back of your hands. To keep track of time, hum the "Happy birthday" song from beginning to end twice. Rinse thoroughly and dry with a clean towel or a disposable paper towel.Use a mild soap with limited oils and chemicals and lukewarm water. If you wear make-up, make sure to get all your make-up off before you begin the steaming process. Make-up can clog pores, leading to acne. It's a good idea to deep cleanse your face before applying make-up.; , Pour water into a pot and heat it over a stove. Only heat the water until it begins to produce steam. You should not heat the water until it boils, as this can burn your face., Essential oils should be added to the water to help cleanse and nourish your skin.   If you're dealing with pimples or acne, bergamot oils has antiviral and antibacterial properties that can reduce breakouts. Geranium oil is also good as it increases skin elasticity and regulates oil production in the skin. Tea tree oil has been known to eliminate acne causing bacteria. If you're prone to frequent breakouts, lemon oil can reduce pores and decrease the likelihood of breakouts.If you're looking to improve skin appearance, there are several options. Lavender oil can lighten skin and reduce the appearance of scars and blotches. Carrot seed oil also rejuvenates the appearance of skin by encouraging cell regeneration. Myrrh has certain anti-aging properties that can keep skin looking younger and blemish-free.Peppermint or green tea, while not essential oils, can be added to water to increase the steam's moisturizing effect., Once the water is steaming and oil is added, wrap your head in a towel and lean over the pot of steaming water. Allow the steam to touch to touch your face. However, do not lean too far in as you don't want the water to actually touch your face as it will likely be very hot. If the steam feels too hot and you feel like your face is burning, wait a few minutes and let the water cool some before beginning the steaming process., Once 10 minutes has passed, you can wash off your face.   Remove the towel and pour out the bowl of steaming water. Wash your face with cool water. Some dead skin cells, dirt, and debris that have surfaced during the cleanse should wash off.Pat your face dry with a clean towel. Use a facial moisturizer to lightly moisturize your face after the cleanse.  

clean your face thoroughly.  heat a pot of water.  add oils.  lean your head over the water.  rinse and moisturize your face. 

 Wrap your fingers behind your head with your elbows sticking out to either side. Sink into a squat until your legs form a roughly 90- degree angle. Keep your upper body as vertical as possible and your chin up so that you are looking forward, not down. From here:Use the balls of your feet to push yourself up and forward into a jump.Don’t worry about jumping high. Simply aim to land a few feet in front of your starting position. As you land on the balls of your feet, absorb the shock with your legs by sinking back into another squat. Jump again and repeat for a total of five to ten reps per set.  Stand within jumping distance with both feet planted hip-width apart, facing the box. From this starting position:Jump off the ground with both feet, using the balls of your feet to push yourself off the ground.Land on the box with both feet, distributing your weight evenly across them to stay balanced. Starting small so you have as much control over your last jump as your first, work your way up until you can complete three sets of 20 jumps per workout. As you master the height of one box or surface, challenge yourself by working with another that is even higher.  Use two dumbbells weighing between 10 and 25 lbs (4.5 to 11.3 kg). Hold one in each hand, down along your sides. Set your feet directly below your shoulders and straighten your back. From here:Jump directly upward, not forward. Shrug your shoulders upward as you ascend. Relax your shoulders as you descend. Land in your starting position with both feet at the same time. Increase your sets and/or reps until you can do three sets of 25.  

do frog jumps.place your feet slightly more than hip-width apart.  use a “jump box.” use an actual jump box that is specifically designed for jumping exercises (which many gyms provide), or use any raised surface that will support your weight, like a sturdy, steady bench or bleachers.  do jump shrugs. 

 Your Miniature Schnauzer will need a high-quality food meant for small breed dogs to help him thrive. High-quality foods often list meat (not meat by-products) as the first two ingredients on the label, so read the ingredients before you buy.   Miniature Schnauzers do well with a dry food that has about a 10 to 15% fat content, so you should also check the label’s nutritional information to see if the food is within this range.; , Feeding your miniature Schnauzer two meals per day on a regular schedule will help to encourage good eating habits and it may also help with potty training.You can use the recommended feeding amount listed on your Miniature Schnauzer’s dog food packaging to help you determine how much to feed him at each meal. Take this amount and divide it in half to determine how much food to offer your Miniature Schnauzer at each meal. Try feeding your Miniature Schnauzer one meal in the morning and one in the evening. If you have a puppy, then you will need to feed him three or even four times per day. Check with your veterinarian or a breed expert to be sure.  Your miniature Schnauzer must always have access to plenty of clean, fresh water.Make sure that you keep a bowl of water somewhere that is easy for him to access. For example, you might place his water dish in your kitchen or a few feet away from his bed.   Change his water daily and check it often. Make sure that the water is always fresh and clean. Clean your Miniature Schnauzer’s water dish once per day to keep it hygienic. Try using a stainless steel bowl since they are durable and less likely to harbor bacteria.  All dogs are prone to obesity as well as humans, so it is important to limit your Miniature Schnauzer’s treat foods. Instead of giving your pet table scraps that might make him sick, offer a small portion of something healthy as an occasional treat. Some good examples include:   cooked sweet potato cooked green beans cooked peas fresh blueberries broccoli baby carrots watermelon chunks banana, Some foods can make your Miniature Schnauzer ill and may even kill your dog if he eats them. These foods include:alcohol grapes and raisins walnuts, almonds, pecans, and macadamia nuts onions, garlic, and chives foods that contain caffeine and chocolate avocados foods that contain yeast foods that contain xylitol 

choose a high-quality dry dog food for little dogs.  feed your miniature schnauzer two meals per day.  provide lots of clean, fresh water.  give your miniature schnauzer some healthy treats.  steer clear of toxic human foods. 

 You don’t have to look like you’ve stepped off the runway, but you should take pride in your appearance when you’re planning to ask out a confident girl. That’s because she likely makes an effort to look good, and will expect the same from a potential date.Take care of all basic grooming habits, so you appear clean and neat when you talk to her. You don’t have to wear the most expensive, trendy clothes, but your outfit should be clean and fit well.; , A confident girl is usually going to want you to be confident as well, so you can’t wait for her to talk to you. Show her that you have plenty of your own confidence by having the guts to walk up to her and start a conversation.If you’re having trouble working up the confidence to approach a girl, try to do it in a situation where she’s more likely to be receptive, such as at a party or bar. In most cases, she’s more likely to be friendly when she’s in a social setting. Remember to smile and maintain eye contact when you go to talk to her. If you keep your eyes down and fidget, she’s going to know that you’re nervous.  Confident girls are direct themselves, so that’s what they typically want in their partners. That means you shouldn’t come up with some lame excuse for approaching her, such as pretending that you need directions or her advice on what to get your friend’s girlfriend for her birthday. Instead, make it clear from the start that you’re interested in her and want to make a connection.If you haven’t been formally introduced, you might go up to her and say, “I saw you across the room and had to come over and introduce myself.” If you already know each other, you can approach her and say, “I’ve been thinking about you ever since the last time we talked.” You can also try offering up a compliment that makes your interest clear, such as “You know, your smile lights up the room,” or “You’re the most beautiful girl in the room, hands down.”  , A confident girl is going to want to know that you’re genuinely interested in her and who she is, so you shouldn’t necessarily ask her out right after you approach her. Instead, start a conversation to get to know her better. Avoid simple yes or no questions that can slow down a chat. Open-ended questions are a better option because they give her an opportunity to really express herself.If she’s in school, you might ask her what her favorite classes are and why. If she’s a frequent traveler, you might ask her to recommend some can’t-miss destinations. Pay attention to what she says, and use it to build off of to keep the conversation going. For example, if she mentions that she’s a big football fan, you can tell her about the big game that you went to last weekend.  Once you’ve gotten to know each other a little, it’s time to ask for a date. Don’t be vague -- asking “Would you maybe like to go out sometime?” isn’t going to impress a confident girl. Instead, make a concrete offer, such as “Would you like to get together tomorrow night?”It’s best not to make your first date something formal like dinner. Instead, go for something casual, such as grabbing a cup of coffee or a walk through a local park. That will keep things relaxed and low-key.  While trying to make her jealous by mentioning your ex or flirting with other girls on social media may seem like a good way to get her attention, a confident girl isn’t going to feel threatened by other girls. In fact, she’s more likely to be annoyed so the ploy will probably backfire on you anyway.It’s inevitable that past relationships will come up in conversation when you’re dating someone -- and that’s okay. It only becomes a problem if you’re trying to use your ex to get a rise out of your current girlfriend.  Because she doesn’t usually get jealous or irrational, a confident girl isn’t going to understand if you do. Don’t try to go through her phone when she’s not looking or guess her social media passwords so you can go through her accounts. Instead, try to be confident in your relationship and trust your girlfriend.If you’re concerned that there is a problem in your relationship, such as her relationship with an ex, just ask her about it. She’ll appreciate the direct approach, and is more likely to be honest with you.  When it comes to making decisions in the relationship, a confident girl isn’t going to want to do all the work herself. She’s going to expect you to know what you want and be able to express that clearly.Even when it comes to a simple decision, such as where you should go for dinner, don’t say, “I don’t know” or “I don’t care.” Offer up a concrete suggestion, so the two of you can make a decision together.  Just because a girl is confident doesn’t mean that she doesn’t like to hear about her strengths from other people sometimes, so don’t let those things go unsaid. Be supportive and tell her about the things you like best about her on a regular basis.Don’t limit your compliments to her physical appearance. Sure, she’ll appreciate hearing that she’s pretty, but she likely wants to be valued as a complete person. Compliment her intelligence, strength, kindness, and other positive qualities as often as you tell her that she looks beautiful in a certain dress.  If you’re both strong, confident individuals, then you’re going to disagree sometimes. That’s actually part of a healthy relationship because differences of opinion allow you to learn from one another. The key is to focus on the issues that you disagree on and not attack each other. When you’re frustrated, it can be easy to resort to name-calling and low blows. Do your best to avoid sinking to that level because a confident girl probably isn’t going tolerate that kind of behavior. Keep your tone of voice in mind. If you’re yelling to try to get your point across, chances are your girlfriend isn’t going to hear you. However, if you maintain a calm, even tone as you explain your feelings, she’s much more likely to take what you’re saying to heart.  A confident girl is probably going to be able to express herself pretty well, so she’ll have no trouble telling you how she feels or what she thinks about your relationship. For a healthy, balanced relationship, you’ll need to do the same and tell the truth about how you feel. She doesn’t want to have to guess how you feel about her or how committed you are to the relationship.You have to be willing to open up to her even if you aren’t sure how she’ll react. Holding in your feelings may only lead to bigger problems down the road. If you’re feeling like your relationship isn’t a priority for her or she doesn’t value your opinion, tell her. She may not be aware that she’s making you feel that way, so the only way to be certain is to express your feelings. If it turns out that she isn’t as committed to the relationship as you are, you’re better off knowing that, so you can decide whether you should move on.  Being a good listener is part of developing effective communication skills, which means you shouldn’t interrupt or talk over her. She's going to want a partner who takes her feelings and opinions seriously, and you can't do that if you don't hear what she's saying. If you’re having trouble really processing what she’s saying, try rephrasing what she’s just said in your own words to ensure that you’re listening and understanding what she’s telling you., A confident girl doesn’t have a problem owning up to her mistakes, so she’s going to expect the same from you. If you’ve hurt her feelings or forgotten about a date, apologize and try to learn from the mistake., In a relationship between two strong, confident people, give and take is a necessity. If you make small concessions for her in a conflict or disagreement, it’s more likely that she’ll do the same for you, so both of you can feel like you have an equal say in the relationship.Don’t keep score. Not all compromises mean that you’re meeting in the middle. In some cases, you might have to concede more than she does and vice versa. If you compromise a little more than her on what to do on Friday night, that doesn’t mean that she “owes” you the next time you disagree. The goal is to find a solution that makes both of you as happy as possible on a case by case basis.  

make a good first impression.  approach her.  be direct.  be curious.  ask her out.  don’t play games.  control your insecurities.  be decisive.  offer compliments.  don’t be afraid of conflict.  be honest.  listen carefully.  admit when you’re wrong.  try to compromise. 

 These can be found at most hardware or army surplus stores.Make sure that any professional grade mask you buy has removable side filters.; , You could use a half airsoft mask that only covers your mouth, or a full airsoft mask with the goggle portion removed.These can usually be found at sports equipment stores and can be cheaper than professional respirator masks.  If you cannot find a full respirator mask, or if your budget does not permit it, you could buy a simple dust mask, also called a particle respirator, instead. These masks do not have mouthpieces or filters and are usually simple white masks that fit over your mouth   If possible, look for one that comes with a thick strap instead of one that uses elastic string.  Twist or unscrew the filters on the side of your respirator mask. The mouthpiece of the mask can stay if it is fairly flat, but if it bulges out more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so, it should be removed, as well.   If you are using a full airsoft mask, remove the goggle portion and cut away any plastic that sits above the goggle glass. Use a sharp knife or saw to remove this plastic. Sand down any sharp edges with an electric sander to avoid injuring yourself on your mask.  Most professional respirator masks and airsoft masks have a small hole where the mouthpiece is/was located, in which case, you do not need to make a cut. If using a dust mask, however, you will need to cut a hole 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) across, directly above the point where your mouth will be.   To get a better idea of where the mouthpiece needs to be, place the dust mask on your face and use a pencil to mark where your mouth is on the mask. Remove the mask and cut the hole using scissors or a utility knife.  Use hot glue to attach these four pieces at even intervals along the top of the mouthpiece. The opposite should be glued down to the top part of the nose piece on your mask.   If you do not have a mouthpiece on your mask, put the mask on your face and lightly mark with pencil a line where your upper lip is. Arrange the pieces of tubing along this line at even intervals. Thin tubing like this can usually be found in a hardware store. For an easier, cheaper alternative, you could use flexible straws instead of tubing. Cut, bend, and shape the straws before gluing them down. Fabric glue or jeweler's glue can be used in place of hot glue if hot glue is unavailable.  Cut another four 3½ inch (8.89 cm) pieces of ½ inch (1¼ cm) tubing. Use hot glue to attach these evenly along the bottom of the mouthpiece section. The other end of each piece of tubing should be glued down to the chin portion your mask.   If you do not have a mouthpiece on your mask, put the mask on and lightly mark the line where your lower lip is with a pencil. Arrange the pieces of tubing along this line equally. As suggested earlier, you might use bendy straws as an alternative to tubing.  Cut two 4½ inch (11.43 cm) pieces of ½ inch (1¼ cm) tubing and two 7½ inch (19 cm) pieces of ½ inch (1¼ cm) tubing. Starting with the smaller pieces:   Hot glue the smaller pieces directly next to the end pieces of tubing above the mouth. The lower end of these two new pieces of tubing should be hot glued to the sides of the mouthpiece. If your mask does not have a mouthpiece, then glue the other end to the midpoint in between your top and bottom mouth tubing rows. Hot glue the larger pieces next to those you just glued on to the top end. Glue the bottom end of these final pieces of tubing next to the bottom end of the lower mouth tubing row. As previously mentioned, you could use bendy straws as an alternative to tubing. Let everything dry completely so you do not break loose the seal of your glue.  Cut a strip of pleather, or other tough black cloth, so that is twice as wide as the width of your straps and just as long. Use hot glue or fabric glue to cover the side-straps with this material, hiding the seam or ends of the material on the inside of the strap.If you do not have wide straps on your mask and only have thin elastic cord, go out and buy a band of 2 inch (5 cm) thick black elastic. Cut this piece of elastic to match the length of your elastic cord and glue it to the mask over the cord. Keep the edges of this band on the inside of the mask to hide them.  Use a soft tape measure to determine the distance from the tip of your nose to the base of your skull. Also measure the width of the bridge of your nose at both the top and bottom.   For a more accurate fit, place the mouthpiece portion of your mask on before proceeding. Measure from the top of this mouthpiece, over your face and head, and down to the point at which the strap meets in the back of your head.  Look for black soft foam that is no thicker than ½ inch (1¼ cm). Use fabric scissors to cut out a strip of foam that matches the measurement of the top of your head, plus one inch (2½ cm) to allow overlap for gluing., To begin with, the foam should be as thick as the widest part of your nose. Next, you will contour the shape of your strip to fit your nose better.  On one end of the foam, narrow down the part where the upper bridge of your nose will be. If necessary, place the foam over your head temporarily and mark the area you will need to trim with a pencil.  Lay your foam over another piece of black pleather and trace the shape onto the other material. Use fabric scissors to cut the shape out of the pleather.   If you do not have pleather, choose another durable, tough black fabric.  Apply thin lines of hot glue to the back of the pleather and press the foam in place onto the glue. Make sure that the edges line up as evenly as possible.  The narrowed part of your headpiece needs to be hot glued just above the top part of your mask nose piece. The wider, even section of the back of your foam strip should be glued to the pleather-covered strap in the back.   Make sure that the strap goes across the front, top, and back of your head in a straight line. Glue the edges of the foam headpiece to the inside of your mouthpiece, hiding them from sight.  Cut two pieces of ½ inch (1¼ cm) tubing that match the measurement you took of the top of your head. These pieces should be the same length as the strip of fabric that covers the front, top, and back of your head.   Hot glue these pieces of tubing along the edges of the top headpiece, one tube to each edge.  Note: these pieces of tubing are too long to substitute plastic flexible straws. If you cannot find tubing, you could either skip this step or use pipe cleaners covered in pleather in place of the tubing.  Take small bolts and hot glue them in pairs along the top headpiece. Each bolt should be on the inside of the tubing along the edge of your headpiece.   You should have five to eight pairs of bolts, or 10 to 16 individual bolts, in total. Space the pairs apart at even intervals. If you do not have bolts, you can use belt studs or similar metallic objects, instead.  Bane's mouthpiece is a dark, intimidating black. To get a consistent, uniform appearance, use spray paint that is labeled to work on a variety of materials (metal, plastic, fabric) and spray the entire mask black.Depending on where you spray paint, you may want to put a layer of newspaper or a drop cloth down before spray painting. Let your mask dry for several hours in a warm spot with low humidity.  For a slightly more authentic look, you can use silver metallic paint and a paintbrush to paint the tubing of your mask silver. This is not strictly necessary, but can add more realism to the final mask.   Check the label to make sure that the paint is safe for use on plastic. Let the paint dry.  Your Bane mask should now be complete. Try it on and see how it looks. If you notice that the straps are loose or tight, make necessary adjustments by trimming down or gluing extra fabric to lengthen the straps.  

find a respirator mask that fits your mouth.a respirator mask with filters on the side and a mouthpiece over the front is preferred.  convert an airsoft mask for tighter budgets.  use a particle respirator for extreme budgeting.  remove any unnecessary pieces.  cut a hole into the mask, if necessary.  attach thin tubing above the mouth area.cut four 3½ inch (8.89 cm) pieces of ½ inch (1¼ cm) thick tubing.  attach thin tubing below the mouth area.  attach thin tubing over the cheeks.  cover the side straps of your mask with pleather.  measure the top of your head.  cut a piece of flexible foam to match the measurement.  trim the strip to the width of your nose.  fit your strip to the shape of your nose.  cut a matching piece of pleather.  attach the pleather to the foam.  attach the foam to your mouthpiece.  place thin tubing alone the sides of your top headpiece.  glue small bolts near the headpiece tubing.  spray paint your mask black.  paint the mouth tubing silver, if desired.  try the mask on. 

 You'll need:; ,  ,  ,,,,,,,, Go to sleep a little earlier than usual, especially if you are skating in the morning. Set your alarm clock for around an hour to an hour and a half before you'll have to leave the next day.  Shower if you need to, and then do your regular morning routines. Have a small, healthy breakfast, and don't eat too much. Some is better than none, as you don't want to feel faint before skating. It's a good idea to have some water or juice as well. After that, you can do anything you need or want to do until around twenty or thirty minutes before you will have to go.  Do not have anything to eat or drink unless you absolutely need to from here until when you are done skating, as you don't want to ruin the dress. You should also do your hair (wear it up; never leave your hair down, unless it's very short, at skating competitions) and make-up now. It's a good idea to still bring along all of your hair items and make-up along, as you will probably want to touch up there.  Once you are at the rink, register, get your gift bag if they are giving them out, and relax until you have practice ice or your group warm-up. You can talk to other skaters or coaches, watch other programs, explore the rink, or look through the racks of skating items that vendors are usually selling.  Don't spend time talking to fellow skaters, or working on moves that aren't in your program, especially riskier ones. Run through your program as much as you can. Remember to look up and smile, and time yourself using the stopwatch if you will be having a time limit.  Use the restroom, spray on some more hairspray, touch up your make-up, brush your teeth... whatever you need! This is a good time to start stretching.  Hold your stuffed animal or favorite item if you brought one, visualize yourself winning, practice your program on the ground, talk to your coach, jump around to get your jitters out; whatever makes you feel good is fine. Remember to take off your warm-up jacket and gloves and take deep breaths. Believe that you're going to win; a positive attitude helps!  , Look up and smile like you practiced, and don't feel rushed. Do all your elements as best as you can, and be proud of yourself, no matter what place you take. , But if you had placings on the program, get ready for your exhibition program later in the day or even after the awards ceremony, which mean you have to get changed all over again.

 Crate training is not only important to the process of housebreaking. Having your Shih Tzu familiar with her crate can help with vet trips, road trips, and other incidents where your Shih Tzu may need to be temporarily confined.   Pick a small dog crate for your shih tzu. You only need enough room for your Shih Tzu to sit, stand, and turn around.Crates should also have ventilation on all four sides. It's not a bad idea to keep the crate somewhere in your home where you hang out frequently. That way, your Shih Tzu can occasionally go in her crate while still feeling like part of the family.Going in the crate should be thought of as a treat rather than a punishment. Keep a water dish, food, toys, and treats in the crate. Make sure any toys and dog safe and big enough that your Shih Tzu will not swallow them.Keep your Shih Tzu in the crate when you sleep, go out, or when you're occupied with a household chore that prevents you from watching her. Do this until your Shih Tzu is housebroken and you know she will not have accidents indoors.It is important not to treat the crate as a "cage" or "prison" and to keep use to a minimum. If necessary, when you are home keep the dog on a lead so you can keep an eye on him and take him outside to toilet as soon as you spot signs of him wanting to toilet.; , While most owners prefer their pets eliminate outside, as Shih Tzus are smaller pets many apartment dwellers own them. If you don't have easy access to the street or a yard, you may want your Shih Tzu to eliminate inside on newspaper or padding.   Paper training's main pro is convenience. For people who have difficulty taking a dog outside for whatever reason, whether a busy schedule or a physical problems, paper training can be an alternative option. In addition to padding and newspaper, dog litter boxes are sold in many pet stores.Paper training's main drawback is that it creates odor and might not be the best option for your dog. Shih Tzu are high energy and crave the outdoors.Whichever route you go with, it's important to be consistent. Shih Tzus may get confused if they're told they can sometimes use a pad but are sometimes expected to go outside. Shih Tzus need a strict schedule for training, so you'll need to pick one option or the other., When you first begin housebreaking your Shih Tzu, you'll need to stick to a strict walking schedule to make sure your pet doesn't eliminate inside.   Sniffing, circling, or squatting are signs a Shih Tzu is ready to eliminate. If you notice these behaviors, either take your dog outside immediately or direct her to the proper place in the house.When you first begin housebreaking a Shih Tzu, you'll need to take her out every one and a half to two hours or every 20-30 minutes for a puppy. You should take her out when you wake up, before you go to bed, and after she eats or drinks.Praise your Shih Tzu immediately after she eliminates outside or in the proper place in your home. Shih Tzus generally respond better to positive reinforcement than negative reinforcement, so praise for success will go farther than scolding for mistakes., Shih Tzu are notoriously difficult to house break. It may take as long as eight months before a Shih Tzu fully understands where it's appropriate to eliminate. Do not be discouraged. Even if you're still having accidents after a few months, be persistent and strict about your training schedule. Eventually, your Shih Tzu should understand and obey the rules., Shih Tzus are highly social dogs and want to be with their owners as much as possible. Separation anxiety is a problem for Shih Tzus and, as it's not possible to bring your dog everywhere, you need to train your Shih Tzu to adapt to solitude.   A crate can be an excellent way to lessen separation anxiety. Shih Tzus tend to be less nervous about being left alone if they have a place of their own to retreat to. Make your Shih Tzu's crate comfortable, with bedding and toys, and leave the crate door open when you are home. This way, the Shih Tzu will not see the crate as a forced experience but her own special refuge.Some people are wary of leaving their dogs in crates, especially if they're gone for long hours during the day. If this is the case with you, you could try allowing your Shih Tzu access to your bedroom, study, or another closed off area of the house where she feels safe., Shih Tzus might develop nervous tendencies if overly coddled. This can result in timidness and even aggression. Expose your Shih Tzu to a variety of sounds and experiences.   Sounds like whistles, lawn mowers, sirens, vacuum cleaners, washing machines, and other day-to-day noises should be familiar to your Shih Tzu. As separation anxiety is an issue, you don't want to risk her hearing an innocuous noise and panicking while you're gone. Exposing your Shih Tzu to a variety of stimuli simply means taking her with you different places and remaining calm and collected in the face of loud or sudden noises.Dogs pick up on cues from their owners. If you get frightened or anticipate a negative behavior from your dog, it's more likely to occur. Staying calm in the face of sudden noises, other dogs, or other people can help your dog stay calm. Do not treat her any differently so she sees the event is normal and not be feared. If she displays any timid behavior, such as cowering or whimpering, it's okay to say something soothing to her or to provide with a treat to make the moment seem happy and positive. However, do not remove her from the situation, pick her up, or otherwise overreact as this encourages an overreaction in the dog. Oftentimes, owners are overprotective of small dogs, leading to what is known as "small dog syndrome." Owners ignore aggressive behavior, like biting, and try to protect smaller dogs from bigger animals by picking them up or panicking when they interact with larger breeds. The combination of lack of discipline and coddling means smaller dogs end up both fearful and somewhat aggressive. Allow your Shih Tzu to safely interact with bigger animals and scold her if she bites or redirect the nipping towards a toy or treat., Having your dog come when called is an extremely important behavior. Not only can this prevent accidents it also fosters a stronger relationship between you and your Shih Tzu.   Always make coming to you a positive experience. Your Shih Tzu should feel that coming when called is the best thing for her. Reward her with praise, attention, treats, and toys when she obeys.At first, it might be helpful to run away from your Shih Tzu when you call her. Dogs see running as a game and she'll find it hard to resist running after you.Start praising your Shih Tzu as soon as she responds to your commands. If she's getting praise, she'll be eager to reach you and less likely to be distracted by sounds, other animals, or other people.If your Shih Tzu does not come when called, do not repeat her name or "come" over and over again. This simply teaches her it's okay to ignore your commands. If she's not responding, try running or shaking a bag of treats while saying "come" or her name rather than repeating the command fruitlessly., As Shih Tzus are small dogs, leash training is particularly important as you don't want to cause strain on their necks or limbs during walks.   Until your Shih Tzu learns not to pull, take her for short walks only. Find alternative ways to exercise her, as walks will be training sessions until she's mastered good leash manners.Reward not puling with treats and praise. Scolding does not work well with Shih Tzus. They're more likely to respond to positive feedback, so praise her for what she's doing right instead of scolding her for what she's doing wrong.If your Shih Tzu gets worked up before a walk, she's more likely to misbehave on it. When you go to get the leash, ignore your Shih Tzu if she starts jumping around. Simply wait until she sits down and clip the leash on her collar. If she starts bouncing around when you reach to clip the leash, stand up and wait for her to calm down again. Do not clip the leash until she's done bouncing, even if it takes awhile.When your dog pulls, do not pull back. Simply stop. If she learns to associate pulling with a negative, the walk stopping, she'll eventually learn not to pull. This works much better than scolding or pulling back, which only serve to further rile up the dog.If your Shih Tzu has a lot of trouble with leash manners, consider investing in a harness until she calms down. Dog harnesses can be purchased at pet stores and will keep your Shih Tzu from straining her neck if she pulls on the leash.  Sit and lie down are important commands as many other behaviors require your dog to sit or lie down first. They provide the foundation for solid training.   To teach your Shih Tzu to sit, at first you should stand before her and say "sit." Then, use a treat and draw an arc over the puppy' s head so that as his head goes up his bottom goes down. Praise her as soon as she hits the ground.As training progresses, you can swap out physically moving your dog for hand gestures. She should understand, with persistence, what the gestures mean. After awhile, try to phase out hand gestures too and get your Shih Tzu to sit when you say so. Be consistent and practice the command 10 to 15 times a day until she's mastered it.Sit is an important command for maintaining control over your Shih Tzu. You'll need her to sit when people come to the door, before you take her for walks, and in other situations where she needs to remain calm. Ideally, she should sit every time she hears the command regardless of other stimuli.Once your Shih Tzu has mastered sit, you can teach her to lie down. Start the same way you started teaching her to sit. Ask her to sit, and then use a treat to lure him into a lying position. Get him to sit then hold the treat at floor level but slowly move it away from him so that he stretches and lies down to get it. As soon as she lies down, praise her with treats and attention. Transition to hand gestures, and then the command alone.Sit and lie down can be used as foundations for other tricks, such as roll over, shake, and play dead. These tricks can all be taught using the same basic formula. Get your dog to sit or lie down, and then physically show her the needed behavior while praising her for performing. Move onto the hand gestures, and eventually vocal commands alone.  Shih Tzus love their people, but they're not as people pleasing as other breeds. They tend to be stubborn and may not consistently follow your rules.   A Shih Tzu's mood is dynamic. She may be willing to sit and stay one day in order to get a treat, but may show no interest in the treat the next day. You can't always use the same training tactics with a Shih Tzu. You might have to switch up how you reward and punish behavior.If your Shih Tzu is ignoring food one day, try rewarding her with praise, toys, or a walk. Shih Tzus are a highly intelligent breed and expect rewards for good behavior. Have a variety of ideas on hand to reward your dog for being good., Although Shih Tzus can be notoriously difficult to train due to their stubborn streak, being firm with them without resorting to scolding or heavy discipline, is an effective means of training.   If your Shih Tzu is acting out or misbehaving, it's better to simply ignore the behavior. Do not give in to jumping, biting, or other attention grabbing behaviors. Do not make eye contact with your Shih Tzu if she misbehaves and do not speak to her or touch her. If your Shih Tzu realizes certain behaviors do not result in attention, she'll cease using them.Always praise a Shih Tzu for behaving well. Shih Tzus enjoy human interaction and affection and are willing to work for praise. Positive reinforcing good behaviors while ignoring bad ones is a great way to get your Shih Tzu to behave., Shih Tzus are great pets, but tend to be one person dogs and prefer homes with more mature family members. Children under the age of 3 might not do well with a Shih Tzu as they'll fail to understand the breed needs boundaries. If you have young children, consider opting for a different breed or keeping your kids and your dog separate.

 Veterans, retirees, and active service members can wear military medals and awards on their civilian clothes during events and gatherings with a military theme.This can include military-oriented days of celebration, like Veterans Day and Memorial Day in the United States or Remembrance Day in Canada. Other ceremonial events that you can wear medals at include parades, military presentations, general veterans or military meetings, and funerals. You should only wear medals on civilian clothes when those clothes are still formal attire. Do not wear medals on casual civilian clothes, even during a military event.; , You can wear your full size medals, miniature medals, or lapel pins. Each option can be appropriate.Enameled lapel pins represent a single medal or decoration. In the United States, there are lapel pins that represent every medal and many award ribbons. Usually, you only wear one lapel pin, and that pin can represent either your highest award or an award that has special meaning to you. Lapel pins are only worn on the lapel of a blazer. For more formal attire, full size or miniature medals are usually more appropriate. Each full size medal has an equivalent miniature medal. Miniature medals create a less cluttered appearance, but the choice between full size and miniature medals is entirely a personal one. While it is not a rule, miniature medals are usually worn during very formal events, especially those held in the evening and requiring full evening dress or dinner dress. Full size medals are most typically worn on morning dress or formal daytime attire.  Your medals should be worn over the left lapel or the left breast pocket of a formal jacket or coat. Medals are mounted on a metal holding bar or bar brooch, and that bar is attached to the lapel.   The center of the holding bar should be parallel to the ground. The most senior medal should be on the right side of the bar in the position furthest away from the left shoulder. The remaining medals should be worn in order of seniority, with the least senior medal on the left side of the bar, nearest the left shoulder. Commemorative or nonofficial awards, when worn, should be placed on the right side. You can only wear one row of medals. The row should not extend past the center of the body or the seam of the left arm sleeve. Note that you should not wear a pocket handkerchief when wearing your medals.  Regardless of the occasion, you should only wear medals that were awarded to you. Never wear medals or awards that were granted to another person, even if that person was a close relative., There is no strict rule governing the number of medals to be worn, but as a general guideline, you should try to limit the number to an amount that can be placed on the holding bar without overlapping.   Typically, this means wearing no more than five medals side-by-side.If you have more medals than you are permitted to wear based on the guidelines outlined for each specific style of dress, wear the orders and decorations that are the most senior or advanced. On rare occasions, you may need to wear more medals and may need to let them overlap. When overlapping medals, the furthest medal on the left should be at the bottom, with each medal to the right progressively and slightly overlapping the one before it. The right medal, which is also the most senior, should be completely visible.  The length of the ribbons attached to your medals will need to vary for each medal since each medal is of a different height. The overall length when measured from the top of the ribbon to the bottom of the medal should be 4 inches (10 cm), however.   The bottom edge of each medal should be aligned with the other medals. Run the medal ribbon through the ring or clasp on the medal. This clasp should be in the middle of the ribbon. Place the doubled ribbon over the top of the mounting bar, then back down through the slot. Sew the back portion of the ribbon to the bar using the stitch holes provided.  It's the type of formal attire used for most ceremonies and events, and you can wear most of your medals with this type of attire.   Place any medals, badges of orders, or decorations on a metal bar placed over the left lapel of your jacket. You can wear one star on the left breast of the jacket, as well. If you have one, you can wear one neck badge suspended by a miniature ribbon. The badge should fall out just below a bow tie or below the knot of a long tie.  White tie apparel, also known as evening dress, is the most formal of civilian attire. Since this attire is only worn for very special occasions, you can wear more of your medals with it than you can with standard black tie attire.   Wear up to four stars on the left breast of your tailcoat. Wear any miniature medals, decorations, and badges of orders on a metal bar positioned on the left lapel of the coat. If desired, you can wear one neck badge suspended on a miniature ribbon of an order below your bow tie. If you have a broad riband sash or shortened riband, wear it over the appropriate shoulder designated by the type of sash. Keep it in between the waistcoat and tailcoat.  Morning dress is the most casual civilian attire you can wear your medals with. This dress style includes any suit or clothing you would wear to formal daytime events. Medals are rarely worn with morning dress, but there are times when the person organizing a daytime event will specify that you should wear your medals.   As with other styles of dress, wear your medals, decorations, and badges of orders on a metal bar placed over the left lapel of your jacket. You can place up to four stars on the left breast of the jacket, as well. When applicable, you can suspend one neck badge on a full-width ribbon. The ribbon should be worn under the shirt collar.  Most English-speaking countries, including the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, follow the guidelines presented here. Be aware that protocol can vary in different countries or cultures, though.   Always check with an official veterans' affairs resource in your country to verify specific dress procedures, especially if you have any doubt or special concerns. Evening, dinner, and morning attire are formal enough throughout North America and the United Kingdom, but in other parts of Europe, only full evening attire (white tie) offers a formal enough occasion to wear your medals. This is typically true in Italy, France, Germany, and Spain.  

know when to wear your medals.  consider the options.  wear official medals on the left, using a metal bar.  only wear your own medals.  limit the number of medals.  keep the length of ribbons in check, as needed.  wear your medals with standard black tie attire.in this case, black tie attire could also be referred to as dinner attire.  arrange the medals appropriately for white tie attire.  know the proper way to arrange medals on morning dress attire.  understand the differences between cultures. 

; ,, Every now and then, squeeze it and mash it a little to speed up the dissolving process.   You can mash it with a large wooden spoon or with your hands.  Do this about 15 minutes after you've let the tamarind pulp stand. Using the back of a big spoon, push the remaining pulp through the strainer. This should allow the pulp to pass and the seeds, hulls, and any twigs to remain in the strainer.  Dispose of the contents in the strainer.  For any left over, pour into a jar and refrigerate. It will keep for up to one week. 

place the tamarind pulp into a small bowl.  pour the cup of warm water into the bowl.  ,  let it stand to soften.  pour the mash into a strainer over a bowl.  scrape the side of the strainer to get any remaining good pulp to release liquid into the bowl.  use the tamarind liquid as required by the recipe.  finished.  

 Autistic people simply do not interpret the world the same way that non-autistic people do. When they struggle to interpret things, it can be challenging to talk, listen, and understand. However, autistic people bring a unique and important perspective to the world.   For example, some may struggle to understand spoken messages, and prefer to communicate through writing. Their mastery of the written word may later lead to fascinating novels or deeply insightful articles that make the world a happier and better-informed place.  Autistic children tend to focus on their passions, and have less interest in other conversation topics. This is not out of dislike of you, but of lack of engagement with the particular topic. On the extreme end of things, some children may have no interest in the topic whatsoever.   Get used to their listening body language. Some autistic people may stare in a different direction, fidget, or be completely silent while they pay attention. It may be that they are actually interested; they just show it differently.  Autistic people may not understand that they're being rude, realize that you're feeling sad, or even figure out that you want to talk to them. If you believe that they've missed something, tell them directly what it is, and help them act on that information.  Although they may want to participate in an activity, it's not uncommon for an autistic child to lack the social skills necessary to join in. They may need coaching on things like starting conversations.   They are social in their own way, but you may need to find out how to include them more effectively.  This does not mean that they can't learn; in fact, many autistic people are sharp and adaptable learners. It's just a matter of you learning how to speak their language. During this process, you need to remember that their needs are unique and not treat them dismissively.   Children with speech delays can benefit from Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) at as young as 18 months. This can help them communicate more easily, and may bridge the gap while they learn to speak. Some autistic people struggle to find the words they want to say. Be patient and ask questions to help figure out what they truly mean. 

recognize that their view on the world is different.  understand that disinterest is not personal.  be aware of missed social cues.  take into account that autistic children may not know how to get involved.  be patient with limited verbal skills. 

 A water-based polish will not give off fumes. By contrast, solvent-based nail polishes can give off toxic fumes. To reduce your risk of potentially inhaling toxic fumes, choose a water-based polish like those made by Acquarella., If polishing your nails at home, do so near an open window or even outside. This will cut down on the amount of fumes you inhale. Avoid nail salons with inadequate ventilation and make sure you choose a well-ventilated spot when you do visit a salon., You can reduce your exposure to toxic chemicals by polishing your nails less frequently. Try using neutral tones that go with a wide variety of clothing and accessories. This means you won’t feel the need to change your nail polish as frequently. 

consider a water-based nail polish.  polish your nails in a well-ventilated area.  polish less often. 

 Fatigue may come as the result of anemia, or low iron, which is quite common during pregnancy. You can counter anemia and boost your energy levels by consuming plenty of iron-rich foods.Some iron-rich foods include: meat, poultry, spinach (and other leafy greens), broccoli, sweet potatoes, beans, and fortified cereals. Supplementing iron is an option, but it can cause upset stomach, so this may not be a good choice for you.  Taking short, frequent breaks can help keep your energy up while you're at work. Getting up and walking around or resting your eyes in a dark room for a few minutes can do wonders for your mood and help counter fatigue. Do this as often as you are able during your work day.Speak to your employer about working short breaks into your daily schedule.  Fitness may be the furthest thing from your mind during pregnancy (especially if you are not feeling well). However, maintaining a modest fitness routine can help boost energy levels and keep you (and your baby) healthy.Try going for a walk after work each night (or on your lunch break). Look for prenatal fitness classes (such as yoga, Zumba, or water aerobics) in your area. Be careful not to overexert yourself.  The best way to cope with pregnancy fatigue is to sleep as much as possible. Avoid staying up late to tackle tasks. Rest is more important to a healthy, comfortable pregnancy than crossing items off of your to-do list. 

consume iron-rich foods.  take frequent breaks.  maintain a fitness routine.  go to bed early. 

 Creating and implementing a green supply chain involves long-term perspective as well as a cultural change in your organization in order to maintain it.; , Going green should not put you in the red. Instead, choices made should impact your business positively if you plan to implement them.    Invest in vehicles that offer you good fuel economy as well as reduced emissions. Consider fuel-efficient tires, and think about implementing driver training to help reduce idling and other emission-causing practices. Check out information from the Environmental Protection Agency's Smartway program at http://www.epa.gov/smartway/ to help you further work on greening up your businesses transportation methods.  What are they doing to help promote a green supply chain, and are you willing to make the move from them if they do not fulfill your environmental impact expectations?   Are the companies that you work with taking active steps to reduce their electricity use by installing skylights or using efficient light bulbs? Do the companies that you receive supplies from reduce, reuse and recycle their materials? Review what sort of carbon impact your suppliers make.  Is it realistic to hold your suppliers to an elevated standard of green efficiency if you, as a company, do not hold yourself to the same standard?   Review how your company can reduce, reuse and recycle. Create an environment within your company that promotes green initiatives and gets everyone on board with the idea of green from within and throughout. Address both internally and with your suppliers if there is a possibility to reduce the amount of packaging needed for your items. Can you reduce costs by reducing packaging? Can you reduce your waste by reducing your packaging? Solicit employees for suggestions and reward ideas that can help your company implement a greener supply chain. Find out more how companies like Toyota successfully implement a suggestion program and how it rewards employees for ideas used.  

realize that this will have to be a long-term change and not a passing fad.  determine how a green supply chain can help improve your bottom line.  look at what changes can be made to vehicles for your business if you haul any of your own materials.  review the current practices of your suppliers.  take a step and look at what your company is doing. 

 Your facial expressions, body position, as well as the tone of voice can all impact how funny you seem. Use your body language to give others a positive first impression and make you seem more outgoing and approachable.Try some of the following signals to alert others that you are interested in approaching them and having a conversation:   Flash your eyebrows upwards Offer your hand in a handshake Open your arms for a hugSmile Make eye contact Stand in the center or close to the center of the room; , It may be difficult to overcome social anxieties and walk up to someone, but this is one of the best ways not only to be more outgoing, but also more approachable. Although this may seem counterintuitive, if you show your willingness to walk up to someone and introduce yourself, it may help the person relax. In turn, this can spark conversations as well as build your confidence.Glance around the room or space you are in and see if there are any potential conversation mates. Make eye contact with the person and slowly walk up to them. Watch the other person’s body language as you approach her. If she crosses her arms or looks away, this may be a sign she isn’t interested in chatting with you. Simple move on and find another person who looks approachable and interesting to you.  You can help yourself be more outgoing by starting conversations in any situation. It may be difficult at first, but the more often you strike up chats, the easier it will get and the more relaxed you may appear. This also sends the signal to other people that you are open, outgoing, and approachable.   Talk to people in your general vicinity, even if they’re complete strangers.Whether you’re at a work conference or family picnic, look to the people around you as potential conversation partners. Cue them with your body language that you’re interested in chatting. Keep conversation topics commensurate with the situation. For example, don’t talk about your personal life at a work conference and don’t use a wedding to vent about your job.  Whether you’re with new people or old friends, you might be a bit apprehensive to actually join a conversation or activity. Break the ice with a joke or statement to relieve any tension and make people happy.Think of lighthearted or funny things to say in advance. Make sure it’s appropriate for the situation. For example, if you’re with people you don’t know, you could say “No wonder it’s so warm in here, there are a lot of lobbyists blowing hot air.” In situation where you know the people, you could exclaim “The grill master has arrived.” Offer a compliment, which can relax other people and make them happy. This can then make it easier for you to be more outgoing. For example, you could say “You have the most beautiful red hair” or “That’s a handsome watch you’re wearing.”  , Let the person or group know who you are, even if you’re already acquainted. This can cue people that you’re approachable and welcome conversations.Let the person know your name and something about yourself if you don’t know him. For example, try "Hi, I’m Jack and I love to swim. I come to this beach a couple of times a week and haven’t ever seen you here. What’s your name and do you enjoy this beach or swimming, too?"Repeat the person’s name to help you remember it and show your interest. For example, say "Hi Christopher, it’s great to meet you! Are you headed into the water?”Be honest with people you know. You can say something such as “Hey there, this the new Emily. I’m trying to be more outgoing with people and get out of my shell.” You might find that your friends, family, or even acquaintances will take this cue to help you to be more outgoing with invitations or seeking conversations with you.  You can keep a conversation going by giving your thoughts and opinions. However, remember to keep the mood as light as possible so the conversation doesn’t end or you alienate your chat buddy.   Find a common interest you have with the person and talk about that. You can say something like “can you believe what’s going on in the cycling world right now? It’s insanity!” Allow the conversation to flow as naturally as possible between different types of subjects. Make sure that each person is speaking equally, which can build your confidence and help you be more outgoing in conversations.Feel free to express your opinions in a way that includes your conversation partner. For example, you could say “I’ve noticed that prices at our local supermarket have really increased and as much as I like to support small business, I’m not sure I can afford to keep shopping there. Have you had this experience, too?”, Host a small party or evening out or take someone up on her offer to get together, especially if these are not activities that you normally do. Getting out and interacting with other people can help you be more outgoing and relaxed. It also includes an element of risk.   Put together a dinner party or organize a small gathering at a restaurant. Invite a mix of people from your social and/ or professional circles. This will put you at the center of attention as host and force you to talk to every person and start conversations among the group.Invite someone you’d like to know better to coffee or lunch. Follow up on your time together with another meeting and see if a friendship blossoms. Accept the invitations others extend to you. This may give you the chance to meet new people and work on being more outgoing. Remember that not accepting invitations multiple times sends a message that you’re not interested. It may lead to your exclusion from fun activities.  One of the hallmarks of an outgoing individual is that they are not quiet around strangers and talk to a lot of different people in any situation.Take the opportunity at personal or professional events to engage in conversations with different people. It may not be easy at first, but the more often you do this, the easier it will get.   Ease yourself next to a person or into a group. Listen to anything they might be saying and move in by saying, “May I move in a bit? I’m really interested in the conversation.” Introduce yourself to an individual within a group. She may then incorporate you into the group and/or conversation., Every individual has different things at which they excel and that they can offer. Recognizing that you are special and bring something to any conversation or situation can boost your confidence to be more outgoing or take risks.   Figure out what makes you special and make a list of these items. For example, you might be a seasoned world traveler. Since this isn’t necessarily a common trait, your ability to embrace the world around you gives you a unique perspective on the world that may interest many people. Avoid comparing yourself to other people, which can undermine your confidence.  Part of being confident is accepting yourself as you are. You may be a quiet person by nature and shouldn’t force yourself to be an extrovert. You can still be confident, daring and impressive even if you're naturally more introverted. One well-placed comment can be as funny or interesting as a five minutes of chatter.   Recognize that you have many wonderful things to offer the world and those around you. Make a list of these qualities or elements and refer to them whenever you feel doubt. Realize that accepting yourself can also help those around you to be good to you, too. This can instill a lot of confidence in you.  Without believing in yourself and your abilities, it can be difficult to be more outgoing and daring. Remind yourself that you are and can be successful at anything to which you put your mind with positive affirmations and highlighting the positive in your life.   Give yourself daily affirmations. For example, tell yourself “I’ve spent so much time traveling and this has given me a really unique perspective on the world and helped me realize that every person deserves equality.” Surround yourself with people who believe in you and bolster your confidence. Remember that confidence can comes from almost anything, such as knowing that you have a positive relationships, a great work ethic, or even that you look good. This can bolster your confidence and make you more able to approach others or take risks.Remember that failure is an important part of believing in yourself. For example, if you lost your job and pushed through the bad time to find a wonderful new job, this shows your ability to succeed even with hindrances.  It’s not uncommon to sometimes have negative thoughts or feelings. But how you handle this type of thinking has a significant influence on how you interact with others and can either bolster or lower your self-esteem. Identify the following types of thoughts that lower your self esteem and then tell yourself to reassess the feelings and thought patters, which can help boost your confidence:   All or nothing thinking, which means you perceive of things as either only good or only bad. For example, you say “If I don’t get this job, it means I’m a failure.” Instead, say “If I don’t get this job, it means something better is waiting out there for me.” Mental filtering, which means you only see negatives about a person and it distorts you views of him or the situation. For example turn “I let the team down and now they’ll blame me for the loss” into “I made a mistake but so have other people. We can learn from this and move forward.” Converting positives into negatives, which means you take any achievement and find a way to make it not count. For example, you could say “Hey, I won a race and it feels great!” instead of “I only won the race because no one entered.” Mistaking feelings for facts. You might think you’re a failure because you’re having a bad day and feel like one. Remind yourself of all of your achievements to counteract this., It’s important to tell yourself that positive developments are both behind and ahead of you. Praise yourself for making positive changes and hitting your goals.   Remember to focus on the positive in every situation, even if you can’t see it at first. For example, you can say “My dissertation may not be perfect, but it’s finished. I completed an academic marathon, which many people can’t do.”Avoid letting bumps in the road discourage you. Encourage yourself to get up, dust off, and move on by reframing what happened in positive terms., The ability to relax and have fun anywhere shows your confidence. Focus on the positive, which can help you be more outgoing with others and be more daring in your life.   Seek out company that is lighthearted and having a good time. They may be laughing or smiling a lot. This can help you feel relaxed and confident and be more likely to express yourself or take a risk. Allow negativity to roll off of your back. If you experience anything negative, take it in and then move past it. Exposure to negative opinions or behavior can undermine your ability to act with confidence.  If you want to be more daring, this usually means taking some risks. Figure out how you want to be more daring and then set attainable goals for yourself.   Use the SMART method as a guideline for your goals. SMART stands for: specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, timely.For example, maybe you want to try paragliding. Your goal might be “I want to get over my fear of heights so that I can enjoy the view from above. I’ll work on getting used to being in higher buildings and looking out so that I can celebrate my next birthday by paragliding with a partner.”Put your goals on paper to reinforces them. Update your goals whenever you meet them. Consider reevaluating your goals at regular intervals to ensure they’re still attainable.  Make sure that your desire to be more daring is within the realm of the realistic for you. This can keep you from not reaching your goals, which in turn might undermine your confidence and willingness to be daring.   See if your goals are realistic by talking to others or researching them. For example, if you want to be a gymnast but are a bit older, it may be difficult to get to the Olympics. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t enjoy gymnastics classes or competitions.  Any time you try something new, you’re being daring because there’s a chance you may not enjoy it or fail at it. Trying new activities or having different experiences whenever you can not only makes you more daring, but it can also boost your confidence and help you be more outgoing with others.Keep an open mind to anything you haven’t tried yet. For example, if a friend invites you to try a new cuisine, don’t hesitate going. Chances are, you may find something you like and even if you don’t, you can say that you tried it. Participate in new or different activities. Get out of your comfort zone and join a club or try changing up your routine. For example, maybe you run every day but would like to jazz up your workout. You could try out Crossfit or another sport such as yoga, both of which can challenge you in different ways than running. Rise above your fears. Any time you try something new, there may be an element of fear to it. Take a deep breath and reassure yourself that this is good for you., Every individual experiences change in their life at some point. Many times, the change involves having courage or being more daring in your life. Welcome change whenever it comes your way, which can help you more readily take risks in the future.   Remember that you are capable of handling anything life throws your way. This can give you the confidence to persevere.When in doubt, take a step back, relax, and let go. Take small steps to accept the changes in your life. Breaking up change into manageable pieces can make it easier to embrace and may make you more willing to take risks related to it.  Just like change, failure happens to most people. But how you deal with that failure can make you more daring and confident. Keep moving forward because many risk-takers experience setbacks before finding success.   Figure out what caused your failure and apply this for future success. For example, if the design of your Smartphone app didn’t catch on, read comments and make tweaks to a new design based on the feedback. Ask for help whenever and wherever you need it. Not only can this help you be more daring in the future, but simply asking for help can help you be more outgoing, too.  

project positivity with body language.  approach other people.  strike up conversations.  use an icebreaker.  introduce yourself.  express your thoughts.  extend and accept invitations.  circulate among different groups.  realize that every person is special.  accept yourself.  believe in yourself.  counteract negative thoughts.  encourage yourself.  have a good time.  set goals for yourself.  have realistic expectations.  try new experiences.  embrace changes.  accept failure. 

 Structure is a crucial component of ensuring stability in a child's life.   Set a daily schedule for your child, but make sure you are flexible if it doesn't work out perfectly. Explain to the child what the plan is for the day. If you deviate from the plan it gives you the opportunity to discuss flexibility with your child. Make sure your child is supervised, especially when very young, at all times. Never leave him home alone unless he is old enough (teenage years). This does not mean never give your child privacy when he needs it, but always make sure he is safe and someone is there to help him if he gets hurt.  Conflict that is witnessed by the child (especially domestic violence) can lead to issues such as depressed mood, anxiety, and behavioral problems.Cultivate healthy relationships. If you are married, show affection and admiration for your spouse in front of your child. This can promote a sense of security, love, and respect for the whole family. Never take out your anger on your child. Physical aggression can lead to a child displaying aggression., Remember your child copies you; if you treat the child well he will treat you well, if you treat others well the child will treat others well. Similarly, your child will learn responsibility if you display responsible behaviors in front of him.   Don’t drink excessively or use drugs in front of your child (or at all, for that matter). Plan ahead and be prepared. If you are going on a trip, pack enough food and extra supplies.  Pro-social behaviors, such as helping others, being part of a team, and being understanding, increase positive and healthy relationships. You can teach your child these pro-social skills through modeling.   You can model pro-social behaviors with your child through play. Try role-playing different social situations in order to teach your child how to respond.For example, you can pretend to be a child on the playground that took away your child's ball. First, notice how your child responds (he may yell and say, "Give me back my ball!"), then you can switch roles to model the most pro-social way to deal with the situation. You might model something like saying, "I feel sad that you took the ball I was using (instead of saying "my ball"), could you please give it back?" Or, you could say something like, "How about we play with the ball together?"  

provide a structured schedule and ensure adequate supervision.  reduce family conflict.  be responsible.  teach pro-social behaviors. 

 First, use your index finger to cover every string on the 5th fret, save the low E. Then, place your middle finger on the 7th fret of the 4th (D) string; your ring finger on the 7th fret of the 3rd (G) string; and your pinkie finger on the 7th fret of the 2nd (B) string. Make sure that you are holding each string down firmly. Then, strum slowly down from the 5th string to the 1st string.          Make sure to leave the top (low E) string untouched. If you play the 6th string, here, then it won't be a D major chord., First, use your index finger to hold down every string on the 10th fret. Then, place your middle finger on the 11th fret of the 3rd (G) string. Put your ring finger on the 12th fret of the 5th (A) string, and put your pinkie finger on the 12th fret of the 4th (D) string. Strum the chord in a single sweep, from the 6th (low E) string to the 1st (high E).  The barre chords are more technically complex than the open D major, and they require much more finger strength. Work on pressing your index finger against the fretboard. Make sure that you can hold down all of the strings firmly enough that you create a crisp, clear-sounding chord.          If the chord comes out twangy or muted, then you are not holding the strings down firmly enough. Pluck each string individually while you hold the barre chord shape. If a particular note doesn't sound clear, shift your finger around until you can play it crisply. Make sure that your fingers are as centered as possible between the frets, and that none of your fingers are accidentally muting other strings. If you move these barre chord shapes up and down the fretboard, you can play any chord. Two frets higher, for instance, makes a C major chord. Two steps lower makes an E major chord.  

play a barre chord from the 5th fret.  barre the 10th fret.  practice barre chords. 

 Try blending together two cups (475 milliliters) of water with 2 cups (300 grams) of spinach in a standard blender. Then add one banana, 1 cup (150 grams) frozen pineapple, and 1 cup (150 grams) frozen mango. Add a scoop of your favorite protein powder and blend until smooth.   Pour the smoothies into two separate mason jars with lids. You can easily transport the smoothie with you to work, on an outing, or as an after-gym meal. You can keep the smoothies in the refrigerator for up to two days after making them.  Quiche can be a healthy and easy breakfast choice if made ahead of time. You can create individual quiches in ramekins or muffin tins. Once they are baked, you can store them in the refrigerator for an easy grab and go breakfast.Another option is to cook an egg or two in the microwave for 45 seconds. You can add chopped veggies and a bit of cheese, if desired.  Take whole wheat tortilla and spread it with 2 tablespoons of peanut butter, almond butter, or cashew butter. Then place ½ cup (150 grams) of chopped fruit on top of the nut butter. Top with one tablespoon of vanilla yogurt. Roll the tortilla up like a burrito and cut in half.Try blueberries, raspberries, peaches, bananas, and/or strawberries in your wrap. To make your breakfast portable, wrap the individual halves in plastic wrap or foil.  Yogurt is filled with calcium, vitamin D, and protein. Take a pint-sized Mason jar and fill it with one cup of Greek yogurt. Then top your yogurt with fresh fruit. You can also add a sprinkling of low-sugar granola.  Soak oats in milk and fruit, and place in the fridge overnight for an easy oatmeal when you wake up. Between soy and almond milks, and berries and cut fruits, the combinations are endless. A mason jar makes your overnight breakfast easy and portable, too. 

grab a green smoothie.  create crust-less quiche to go.  try a fruit and nut butter wrap.  make a yogurt cup.  try overnight oatmeal. 

 Finding places where exposure could have happened can help with diagnosis, and prevent further contamination.These eggs are frequently passed through accidental ingestion. Fecal contamination is a possibility especially in poor sanitary/hygiene areas. You may not be able to visibly spot the eggs. While the worms can grow up to a couple of inches in length, the eggs will need medical instrumentation to detect., You may have come in contact with the same substances they have.See what they ate, drank, or touched of an organic nature that may have been a carrier for the eggs.  See if another animal or insect have been exposed and carried the infection into local consumables.Sometimes these other animals and insects will eat the eggs and then contaminate the food, water, and/or soil supply indirectly. The infection can spread by one consuming the intermediate host. The intermediate host may not show any obvious signs of infection. Contact an entomologist (expert on insects) either locally or if one can be reached at a nearby university for assistance on identifying infected insects in the area. Consult local environmental reports to see if any infections are reported. Ask your local forestry, or game and wildlife service to see if any animals in the area have been infected with tapeworms.  If you do any yard or farm work, this is especially important.Accidentally ingesting some contaminated soil by putting your fingers to your mouth can lead to infection. Fecal contamination is a risk as the reproducing worm and eggs can pass through the bowels. Ask government agencies for reports on potential contamination. Get independent verification if possible. See if there are any environmental groups that work in the area and have contaminant information. Also independently verify their data if possible.  This is of even greater concern in poor sanitation/hygiene areas.As with the food supply and soil, this is an at risk area for exposure to the eggs and fecal contamination from intermediate hosts. Ask to see if others have been infected from a particular water supply. File requests with the local government to get reports on the environmental health of the water supply. Independently verify the data with other sources if possible. Check with local environmental groups to see if they have been monitoring contamination of water supplies. But independently verify the data.  

identify locations the dwarf tapeworms may have placed eggs.  ask if others have been infected around you.  examine the possibility of secondary hosts.  determine if local soil has been exposed.  examine potentially exposed water supplies. 

 Bib patterns are easy to make yourself. Make sure you draw neck straps about an inch wide to leave room for the snaps on each end. Baby bibs should be about:   10.75 inches from top to bottom. 8.5 inches from side to side. 11 inches around the neck.; , As easy as bib patterns are to make yourself, you may want to use one already tested out. Find a free pattern download at http://www.lifewithmylittles.com/2015/07/best-and-easiest-bibs/., Pick something soft and absorbent, like terrycloth or one called minky fabric. Minky is extra soft for wiping around babies' mouth. Look for cotton fabric, since it won't irritate your babies skin and is hypoallergenic., You will need two pieces of fabric total, one for each side of the bib. Pin your pattern parallel to the perimeter of the fabric with sewing pins that are spaced about four inches apart., It’s best to use scissors designed for and used solely on fabric. Simply cut the fabric around your pinned pattern with sharp scissors, so it doesn’t fray., Use a complementary pattern for the fabric on the back of your bib. You can also use the same fabric you decided to use for the front., Take both pieces of cut fabric and lay them together so the right sides are facing each other. Place your pins parallel to the edges and about an inch from the perimeter. Place as many pins as you think is necessary to keep the fabric pieces securely together., Use a sewing machine to stitch around the pinned pieces of fabric. Place your stitch as close to the edges as possible. Do not sew all the way around the bib. Leave two inches of space open at the bottom.  Grab ahold of the two inches you left open at the bottom, and turn the fabric right side out. This may take a bit of tugging around the neck straps, since they’re not as wide as the body of the bib., To make the next steps easier, it’s best to iron your bib flat. The two pieces of fabric may have a gap between them and look wrinkled, after you turn them right side out. Smooth them down with your hands first. Then use a properly heated iron to flatten out the fabric thoroughly.For cotton fabric use high heat. For polyester-cotton blends use medium heat., Now that your bib is right side out, you can sew all the way around it. Sew a topstitch 1/8th of an inch from the edges with your sewing machine. It will make your bib look professional and put-together. Keep the following things in mind:Use an all-purpose thread. Adjust the tension on your machine so it is not too loose or too tight. Make your stitches 3 mm wide. Don’t backstitch to secure the topstitch. Shorten the stitch length as much as possible towards the end instead., Plastic snaps are great to use on baby bibs, because they don’t weigh as much as metal ones and snap pliers will quickly and easily attach snaps to your baby bib. Make sure you attach snaps on opposite sides of each neck end.Place each snap a half inch from the tip of each neck end and center them. Place the appropriate plastic stud on the fabric and use your pliers to secure it in place. 

trace a bib pattern.  find a bib pattern online.  choose fabric that is good for a baby.  pin the pattern to your first piece of fabric.  cut the fabric around your pattern.  repeat step two and three with your second piece of fabric.  pin both fabric pieces together.  sew around your bib, but leave a gap at the bottom.  turn the bib right side out.  iron the bib flat.  sew a topstitch all around the bib.  attach snaps with snap pliers. 

 You can do this by looking through people's bases who attacked you earlier on in your battle log, do the "Quick Match" method, or finding a player's base on the GRA map. The base should be at a level so that your commanded attacks (A10s, Hellfire Missiles and Orbital Strike) are able to destroy them.; , Your strike force increases the damage and health of about 60% and this is very good for every base. Preferably activate it to your rangers, as they will burn defenses down more quickly and can speed up the process. Use the Strike Force before it runs out - you won't be able to use it on a tarmac for 1 hour after the first use of it is finished.  Don't just dive into a base that looks like a walk in the park and hope for the best. Take the time to work out the areas of possible dangers and possible safety. Tap/Click on a defense or structure of the base, as this will give you information of it's health and level. If the base looks undefeatable, such as, your up-to-date Level 14 HQ base getting put up against a very strong Level 20 HQ base, then it is probably not worth losing some of your medals over. If the base looks easy enough to defeat and you may not lose a sufficient amount of troops, then feel free to turn it to rubble.  Go in and destroy or weaken as many defenses as you can with the radius of the airstrike. Don't just use it to kill commandos at a rally flag, or oil derricks and supply stockpiles holding loads of loot. Use it carefully, especially for when it is more than capable of destroying something.  You can use the Orbital Strike to take down what may not have got fully destroyed in the A10 airstrike and focus it on a rally flag of commandos that are at an inconvenient location.  This has a smaller radius than the A10 and should only be used to destroy a single target rather than multiple. Also use it carefully and see if it can weaken or destroy other structures around it.  When the base is destroyed at a level that you can attack it, leave behind enough command points that will get you enough for a Medpack. These are vital to prevent any sudden ambushes or damage to your troops as soon as they are deployed.  A combination of rangers and Tomahawks are a good combination that is one of the best out there. Deploy your rangers first, and then deploy your Tomahawks at a safe distance so they are not ambushed, as Tomahawks are very weak.  As you keep destroying the base, keep feeding command points to your troops as well as managing them carefully or saving up for another approach with an A10 or Hellfire or Orbital Strike.  Use whatever command points you have to use on defenses or your troops to speed along the process. Be careful though, you will lose medals if you don't achieve any stars!  , Once you place a commanded attack or as soon as you deploy your troops, you have 3 minutes to destroy it completely. Don't be in any rush to get it done. Use the time wisely and the music to the attacking process can even keep you in time!  , If the base is giving away loot, the loot may be increased by 10% or 20% depending on how many stars you achieve. You will also receive medals depending on how much you were able to destroy. Rush back though to call back all your troops before the time of your strike force runs out on your tarmac!  

find a suitable base to destroy.  activate your strike force to your tarmacs.  scout and observe the base.  use your a10 airstrike to start.  use the orbital strike to destroy damaged defenses or just a regular defense.  use a hellfire missile to destroy and/or weaken the strongest of defenses.  leave behind at least 5 command points.  deploy your troops.  manage your command points as you go.  retreat only if you have to.  be aware of the time limit.  celebrate your victory! 

 The top of the scarf should hug your right shoulder. Allow the rest of the scarf to hang behind your shoulder.  Bring the scarf around your back and insert your left arm into the opening. The opposite end of the scarf should now hug your left shoulder.  Adjust the fabric so that it fits comfortably on your shoulders. There should be an even amount of fabric on each shoulder. The portion of the scarf crossing your back should be flat and snug.  

slip your right arm through the scarf.  slip your left arm into the loop.  adjust the shawl. 

 Bend the edges of the flap until it forms a three-dimensional half circle.; , You'll be dipping the paintbrush into this container.  Stick the newspaper strips or bits over the glue and onto the cardboard. It's okay to glue over the edges.  Add newspaper to this side too. Keep the cardboard bent in shape.  Use the flap which has the exact same length as the first flap removed. Again, bend it until it forms a three dimensional semi-circle shape.  Keep the cardboard bent in shape.  Remove these from the box. Then, cover the other two shorter flaps in glue and newspaper on, both sides.  Use the flaps on the other side of the box this time. Cover in newspaper and glue as before. , Pick one side on the front or back of the oval. Bend it wither left or right, but do not break it off. Do this to both sides on each piece of cardboard.  Push together until they dry and stick together. You might want to push the flaps closer to each other to make the fish fatter or wider.  Glue the edges to the body of the fish's edges. Do the same with the other side too.  Glue a rectangular flap to the center of the fish on the outside. Do this with both pieces. (The third remaining flap is yet to be utilized.)  , Fill with candy and sweets, perhaps some confetti or sparkly cut-outs.  Glue the center of this to one side (front or back) of the fish.  The fish can be all one color, multi-colored or two-toned. Use your imagination and whatever paint you have to hand.  Put about half an inch of string on the top of the fish. Tape it in place firmly. Hang the opposite end to the ceiling or from a bungee cord. , Inflate it as large as it will go without popping.  Either make squares or strips, whichever you feel most comfortable working with.  Then smooth onto the balloon, pressing out any wrinkles before they set.  Completely cover the balloon. Let dry for 4 to 5 hours, or overnight.  Allow to dry. Then add another layer, dry and one more layer, dry. This makes for three extra layers in total on top of the original layer.  Draw onto thin colored card (the card should complement the colors to be used in the crepe paper.) These must be large enough to fit the balloon size. You'll need to draw:   A top fin 2 side fins A fulsome tail Fishy lips Two large round eyes (or you can use large googly eyes).  Trim as needed.  Leave to dry.  Push through the papier mâché layer and pop the balloon.  Use papier mâché to attach each feature in it anatomically correct position. Use three layers to be sure the pieces are properly attached, allowing for full drying time between each layer.  Paint it completely white, then let it dry.  You can use one color, although two-toned colored rows (one row one color, the next row another) will ensure the best effect. Bunch up the rows as you glue them down the body space, so that they appear wavy and stand up a little way (not flat against the body).   Do not take the scale rows over any of the fish features or face. Use PVA glue to attach the crepe paper.  Use a different color again for these areas and simply cover them flat with crepe paper, using squares or pieces until fully covered.    Add the eyes. Either glue on large cardboard circles (you can use a marker to fill in pupils) or glue on large googly eyes. Add the lips. Paint them any color you like.  Cut a small slit alongside the top fin. Fill with sweets and candies, and maybe some confetti or sparkly cut-outs too.  Attach a length of string.  Loop the string over something solid, or hang from a bungee cord. It's now ready for play!  

remove one of the long flaps from the cardboard box.  pour the glue into the container.  cover the surface of the cardboard semi-circle with glue.  flip the cardboard semi-circle over.  remove a second flap from the box.  cover it with glue and newspaper as with the first flap.  now fix the the shorter flaps.  make three more cardboard pieces that are covered in newspaper.  cut each covered long piece of cardboard into an oval shape.  ,  take one piece of cardboard.  glue each bent piece to the other bent piece of the other piece of cardboard.  cut the shorter flaps to fit the bottom and top of the body of the fish.  bend over a thin rectangle on one side of each of two of the remaining flaps covered earlier.  open one end of the fish with care.  take the third and final cardboard piece covered in newspaper.  paint as you want.  attach the string to the finished fish piñata.  it's ready for play!  ,  inflate the balloon.  tear or cut the newspaper.  dip the newspaper pieces into the craft glue or flour paste to cover.  continue adding all the pieces.  add another layer in the same way.  draw designs for the fish features.  cut out each piece neatly.  cover each cardboard piece with papier mâché.  stick a pin into the balloon.  add the fish features to the balloon.  paint the dried fish.  glue crepe paper around the fish in stripes that form the scales.  cover the fish features and facial area with flat pieces of crepe paper.  finish the facial details.  fill with candies.  punch or cut a hole through the top fin.  hang the fish piñata. 

 Consider who you're teaching and know their skill levels. For example, are you teaching children? If so, at what point are they on the developmental stages with literacy? Or, perhaps you're teaching adults. In this case, what are their comprehension and language skills like?   If the information is not readily available to you, you can always ask people to let you know what they feel about their letter writing skills or you can do a small and easy test before classes begin, such as by way of a survey or email reply.; 

carefully consider your audience. 

 Find a mushroom in dark places. Get bonemeal by placing one bone on the crafting grid.; , The size for grown red mushroom are: 5x5x6.  Attach the ladders on 3 blocks of the trunk, closest to the ground.  Use any material to cover the inside of the mushroom. Light up the inside with a torch. 

get a red mushroom and bonemeal.  use the bonemeal on a red mushroom on the ground.  get some ladders.  build the floor.  place a bed on the inside, and a crafting bench.  

 Cauliflower has a mild, creamy taste that soaks up other flavors well, just like rice. Any dish that calls for white or brown rice can be made using cauliflower rice, instead. Here’s how to make it:Clean and chop 1 head of cauliflower. Process the chopped cauliflower in a food processor until you have small, rice-sized pieces. Cook the “rice” by placing it in a saucepan with a tablespoon of melted butter; cover and steam for 8 minutes.  The flesh of roasted spaghetti squash really does have the texture of al dente spaghetti. It’s a simple dish that hits the spot in the fall and winter months, when spaghetti squash is in season. You can even dress the squash with marinara sauce, or substitute it for pasta in another favorite dish.  To cook spaghetti squash,  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Slice the squash in half lengthwise. Scrape out the seeds. Rub the flesh with olive oil, salt and pepper. Place the squash halves in a roasting pan cut side down and roast for 40 minutes. When the flesh has cooled, scoop it out; serve plain or dressed with sauce.  This is your summer vegetable season counterpart to spaghetti squash. Spiralized zucchini has a springy texture and mild flavor that makes it a great substitute for carb-laden pasta. It’s easiest to make it with a spiralizer machine; you just peel the zucchini and feed it through. If you don’t have one, follow these steps:   Peel a large zucchini. Use the large holes on a box grater to grate long, thin pieces of zucchini. Alternately, slice the zucchini into thin strips with a knife. Steam the zucchini with olive oil and water for about 10 minutes, until cooked.  Any pasta dish can be made into a low-carb-friendly meal by subbing out the pasta for fresh greens. You can serve the greens simply dressed with olive oil, parmesan and pepper, or go for a heavier pasta sauce to satisfy your craving.   Try arugula, butter lettuce or a spring green mix to serve with lighter sauces. If you want a bed of greens that will hold up to thick sauce, try cooked spinach or swiss chard in place of pasta.  You don’t have to give up your favorite sandwich experience when you go low-carb; simply swap out the bread for a sturdy piece of iceberg or romaine. Start by spreading hummus or mayonnaise on the piece of lettuce, then top with cold cuts, fresh veggies and your other favorite sandwich mix-ins.   If you want a sturdier wrap, try using a collard leaf instead of lettuce. You can use lettuce in place of the crust when you’re craving pizza, too. Brush the piece of lettuce with olive oil, add a sprinkle of cheese and some toppings, and pop it under the broiler for a few minutes to melt the cheese.  

substitute cauliflower for rice.  try spaghetti squash.  spiralize zucchini.  swap out a bed of greens for pasta.  use lettuce wraps instead of bread. 

 The valance is L-shaped so the top surface can be mounted inside the upper frame and the front of the valance will hide the headrail.          Place the valance on a flat surface with the front of the valance in an upright position. Measure 3 inches (7.6 cm) from each end and position each bracket so the top edge is against the upright valance. Use a pencil to mark the 2 screw holes in each bracket. Predrill the four holes, with a smaller bit than the actual screws you will use for the screws (if possible).; , Mark holes for the brackets on the inside of the upper frame of the door or window.          Measure 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the side of the frame and 1 inch (2.5 cm) out from the glass. Hold the first bracket in place, place a screw in the first hole and tap with a hammer to make a mark. Make another mark in the second hold. Repeat on the other side for the second bracket.  Attach the valance and brackets to the inside frame.          Position the valance in the window so the marks you made in the upper frame are visible through the holes you drilled in the valance. Have a helper hold the valance while you attach the screws through the bracket and valance. Repeat. Repeat on the other side for the second bracket.  Snap the blinds head rail into the brackets by hooking the front end into the clip and then lifting the back end until it clicks into place.  If you don't know how, see the section on attaching the vanes later in the article.         

screw holes into the valance.  mark the bracket location on the frame.  attach the components.  snap in the headrail.  attach the vanes. 

 Free patterns for Minecraft character heads are available online, or you can choose to make your own on your computer. Once you have the right pattern, save the pattern files to a thumb drive.   To search for a pattern, go to your favorite search engine and type in adequate search terms like "Minecraft Steve head pattern" or "Creeper head PDF." A few popular—and free—patterns can be found here:  Steve head: http://www.stevelange.net/2011/10/24/making-your-own-minecraft-steve-head-from-pdfs/  Creeper head: http://stlmotherhood.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/CREEPER-Mask-and-sides.pdf  Enderman head: http://pixelpapercraft.com/papercraft/50904699f7e521e71f00003c/life-size-enderman-head    Alternatively, you can use any high-resolution image of the desired character's head and enlarge all five sides to a size of 11-inches by 11-inches (28-cm by 28-cm).; , Take the saved pattern to copy shop and print off all five sides of the head.   If you have a large printer with plenty of ink at home, you might be able print the pattern yourself. For most people, however, your local copy shop is a better option. Print the patterns in poster setting with a tile scale of 100% and an overlap of 0.005 inches (0.0127 mm). The pattern will need to be printed on 11-inch by 17-inch (28-cm by 43-cm) paper., You'll need a cardboard box shaped as an 11-inch (28-cm) cube.   You can either buy an 11-inch (28-cm) cubical box or trim down a larger box so until all three dimensions (length, width, height) are 11 inches (28 cm) long. Tape the bottom of the box closed, if necessary. Fold the flaps on the top side into the box to create an opening. If the flaps threaten to fall back down when the box is inverted, tape them to the inside of the box.  Turn the box upside-down so that the closed bottom is now the top. Coat the new top with spray adhesive or glue from a standard glue stick, then carefully press the hair portion of the pattern onto the box.   Note that you will need to trim off any excess white paper from the pattern image before adhering the image to the box. There will probably be some overlap onto the sides of the box. You can hold this overlap down with additional glue or clear tape.  Work around all four sides of the box, gluing the rest of the head portion on one side at a time.   As with the hair, you will need to trim away any excess white paper before gluing the pattern images to the side of the box. Use spray adhesive or a standard glue stick to adhere the pattern pieces to the box. Make sure that the pattern pieces match up appropriately. In other words, the back image of the head should lie on the opposite side of the box as the face image, the left side image should be to the left of the face, and the right side image should be to the right of the face.  Use a box cutter or utility knife to cut out the two square eyes at the front of the face image. This will create eye holes for the wearer to see through.   At this point, the head portion of the costume should be finished and read to wear.  Minecraft Steve wears an aqua t-shirt and standard blue jeans.A light blue t-shirt could also work if you are unable to find an aqua shirt. Tuck the shirt into the jeans around the right front side. Leave it un-tucked on the left side and in the back.  The game character wears dark gray shoes, so if you have gray or black sneakers, those would be your best choice for this costume.  Use scissors to cut out enough squares to cover the arms, legs, and torso of the costume wearer's body.s   You'll need to use four to five different shades of green. The exact number of felt squares you'll need will vary depending on the size of the wearer. For a small boy's costume, you will need approximately 30 sheets of 8-inch by 11-inch (20-cm by 28-cm) felt. Try to keep the consistently sized. Cut them out so that they are approximately 3 inches (7.6 cm) to 4 inches (10 cm) in length/width.  Glue the squares of green felt onto a green sweatshirt and green sweatpants. Use a hot glue gun for best results.   If you are unable to find a green sweat suit, opt for a gray or black one. Arrange the squares side by side and randomize the pattern as well as possible. Only apply a small dab of glue to all four corners of each square before sticking it to the material.  Green sneakers are hard to come by, but gray or black shoes will work adequately well for this costume.  Endermen are entirely black, so the body of the costume should consist of a long-sleeve black t-shirt, black pants, and black shoes.   Endermen also have notable long arms, so you could mimic this effect by wearing an oversized long-sleeve shirt with arms that extend well below your waist.  Endermen are often seen carrying blocks in the game, so you can enhance the costume by carrying around a small cubical box or block.   Consider painting the block to look like dirt, grass, gravel, sand, or TNT. Alternatively, you can carry around a fake flower. Endermen can carry tulips, orchids, dandelions, poppies, and other flowers in the game, making this another worthwhile accessory for your costume.  You should be able to find free patterns for the player's diamond sword and diamond pickaxe online, but you may also be able to create them on your computer. Save the pattern to a thumb drive once you find the right one.   Go to your favorite search engine and try searching along the lines of "free Minecraft pickaxe pattern" or "diamond sword costume printable." You can find free printable patterns here:  Diamond Pickaxe: http://kerryannmorgan.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Minecraft-pickaxe-template-pdf.pdf  Diamond sword blade: http://kerryannmorgan.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/diamond-sword-template-1-pdf.pdf  Diamond sword handle: http://kerryannmorgan.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/minecraft-diamond-sword-2-pdf.pdf    Another option is to find high-resolution images of the diamond pickaxe and/or diamond sword and enlarge them on your computer until they are roughly 11 inches (28 cm) wide by 17 inches (43 cm) long.  Print the patterns onto 11-inch by 17-inch (28-cm by 43-cm) paper.If your home printer is capable of printing onto paper that large, you can print the patterns out at home. Consider using heavy cardstock or photograph paper to maximize the image quality. Another option would be to take the files to your local copy shop and print them out there. The image quality will be better, and if you're already going there to print out the patterns for the costume head, you can get these patterns printed out during the same trip.  Use scissors to cut around the images in the pattern.   Trim off as much excess blank space as possible. You should cut around the images, but you do not need to worry about cutting around every block during this step. The only place you need to be precise at are the edges where separate pieces (the blade image and the handle image) will join together. Open edges can be roughly cut.  Lightly coat the back of each pattern image with spray adhesive, then firmly press the image onto foam core board. Allow the glue to dry.   A standard glue stick can be used instead of spray adhesive if desired. Use foam core board instead of using craft foam board. Foam core board is stiffer and more durable, making it ideal for use with costume accessories. Arrange the separate pieces of each tool onto the foam board in the proper order. In other words, the handle of each tool must be centered and connected to the blade of the corresponding tool. If necessary, use a metal L-ruler to match the angle of the handle to the angle of the blade.  Use a utility knife to cut round the entire perimeter of each tool. Once the tool is cut, it should be ready to use for your costume.   During this step, you will need to make precise cuts around each block of the perimeter. Place the foam onto a hard garage floor or cutting board before cutting out the pieces. You will need to apply enough pressure for the knife to cut cleanly through both the paper and foam.  

find the right pattern.  print the pattern onto poster paper.  prepare the box.  glue the hair to the top of the box.  adhere the remaining pieces to the sides of the box.  cut eye holes.  wear an aqua t-shirt and jeans.  opt for gray shoes, if possible.  cut squares from green felt.  adhere the felt squares to a green sweat suit.  wear dark shoes.  dress in all black clothing.  consider carrying a box.  find the right patterns.  print the patterns.  cut around the shapes.  adhere the pieces onto foam board.  cut the board.

   How you organize your writing submissions with binders will depend on the type and length of your writing endeavors. Tailor the following system to your situation. Standard binders are approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm). For larger, multi-volume submissions, you may need larger binders. For durability, choose vinyl or non-paper binders.; ,,, Depending on your specific kind of writing, these subsections can include agents, magazines, online publications, current clients, potential clients, and/or publishing houses.  The dossier should include the most current contact information and detailed guidelines for submissions, queries, or completed projects. Technical writers should also include any stylistic guidelines specific to their clients.    Keep the queries, submissions, writing samples, or completed projects in this binder ordered chronologically. Anything with an upcoming deadline should appear first in the binder.  On the first of every month, rearrange so the current month is the first month seen when the binder is opened.    The contents of this folder should be clearly marked with the date of submission as well as the anticipated waiting period for a response. If the client said responses would be issued in 6 to 8 weeks, wait 8 weeks until sending a follow-up. Refer to your binder of publishing house dossiers to remind yourself of specific waiting periods. If a publisher, magazine, agent, or client has rejected your submission, query, or project, keep the rejection slip. If you submit a new piece at a later date, refer to any suggestions or hints they offered for future success. Keeping rejection slips serves as a reminder not to send multiple submissions to the same company. ,   Organize writing submissions that have been accepted into 2 subsections. The first subsection should include writing submissions that require additional changes or work before final approval. The second subsection should include writing submissions that have been accepted as is.  

determine how many binders you will need by examining your submissions and organizing according to your intentions for each writing.  purchase the appropriate amount of binders, each in a different color.  ,  designate 1 binder for all the potential places where you want to submit your work.  ,  divide the binder into relevant subsections using colored tabs.  make a dossier for every place you want to submit your work.  designate 1 binder for submissions to be mailed or emailed.  divide this binder into 12 subsections, each subsection being a month.  designate 1 binder for submissions for which you are waiting on a response or client approval.  designate 1 binder for submissions which have been rejected.  ,  designate 1 binder for submissions which have been accepted. 

 Think of doing a crunching motion, bringing your ribs down toward your hips.   Note that although the Ab Lounge 2 directions instruct you to do an abdominal crunch, the resulting jackknife motion--as your hips drop and your legs and upper body come up--happens at your hip joint, not the lumbar spine. Your rectus abdominis muscle doesn't perform hip flexion; your hip flexors do.  Although your rectus abdominis muscle doesn't perform the primary motion during this exercise, it does work to stabilize your lumbar spine against the pull from your hip flexors.  

squeeze your rectus abdominis muscle that runs down the front of your abdomen from ribs to pelvis.  relax back to the starting position and repeat. 

 This is a big piece of news you are about to share and it's okay and perfectly normal to feel nervous. Depression is considered a mental illness, and because there are a lot of misconceptions about individuals struggling with mental disorders like depression, people can sometimes feel stigmatized with their new diagnosis. However, realize that opening up about your illness is one of the steps to effective coping and recovery., Many people don't just have one best friend but instead have a bunch of really close or even "best" friends. You need to think about who you are sharing the information with and whether this is a good for you.If you are already in counseling, explore this topic of sharing your depression with a friend with your counselor, therapist, or psychiatrist. If your friend is a great listener, discreet, trustworthy, reliable, non-judgmental, supportive and mentally healthy, then this friend sounds like the ideal person to share your concerns with. Your friend can be a sounding board for you and help you maintain a healthy perspective as you work through your recovery.  If you're questioning whether or not you should tell your friend about your depression, consider how you'd respond to the following questions:   Does your friend make disparaging remarks about “crazy people”? Can your friend be condescending or judgmental at times with other people? Is your friend going through his or her own depression issues? Can your friend be insensitive to you at times? Does your friend handle emotions well? Does your friend gossip or spread rumors? If you answered yes to any of these or recall any instances where your friend exhibited disconcerting attitudes and behaviors, it might be best that you just simply let your friend know that you are going through some major issues, but that you’re working on them, getting help and will be in touch. That said, sometimes friends can surprise us. If your friend is able to drop her usual behaviors or attitudes out of concern for you, and if you feel comfortable sharing this information, you can start with small pieces of information to share and see how well your friend receives it. Back off whenever you feel uncomfortable or upset.  How much are you going to share? Sharing your condition is up to you, irrespective of whether or not you have received an official diagnosis.Start with what you think your friend will need to know both about depression in general and about your specific experience of it. What about depression is important for your friend to know? What misconceptions or myths might be important to correct? What about your personal experience is important for your friend to know?   Keep in mind that your friend may have someone in her family who is depressed and may know a lot about the illness. On the other hand, your friend may know very little about depression. It is important to read up on depression and educate yourself about your illness so that you can help your friend better understand depression, how it affects you, and how they can help and support you going forward. In addition, educating yourself about depression has its own benefits for your recovery process!Remember that you do not have to explain why you're depressed. You don't need to provide a justifiable reason to be depressed or to feel sad. All you need to do to share your feelings with your best friend is to tell honestly them how you’re feeling, and ask for what you need from them, be it support, patience, understanding, or space.  While you may not be able to predict how they're going to respond, weighing different possibilities might help you prepare. Be sure as well to think about how different reactions might make you feel and how you might respond. Planning in advance for this helps make sure you're not caught off-guard and that you keep your goals for the conversation in sight.Keep in mind that your friend may not understand you. People who have never suffered from depression may not be familiar with the symptoms. This means that sometimes they have a hard time understanding why you can’t “just stop feeling sad” or “just get out of bed.”This isn’t necessarily a lack of empathy or compassion on the part of your friend. Instead, it could be the case that this person cares about you and wants you to feel better, but doesn’t understand how the disorder makes people feel. Another possibility is that your friend may feel like it’s her responsibility to “fix” you. Your friend might think that they can help "lift" you out of your depression. This is not their job, as it puts pressure on both her and you. Another possible reaction is to abruptly change the subject or turn the focus of the conversation around onto herself. This possible outcome can feel hurtful, like your friend is being selfish or doesn’t care about you, but it is more likely the case that they simply don’t know how to respond to what you’ve said, or that they are trying to show you that they’ve been in a similar situation and can relate to what you’re feeling. In each of these scenarios, prepare what you will do and say. For example, if your friend seems to be reacting to your disclosure by using language that implies they want to "fix" you, point out that it's not your friend’s job to fix you (since you're not "broken") and that what you would like instead is support. If she has a hard time accepting this, plan to say something like "I have to be able to sort this out on my own. Your support means the world to me, but you can’t do this for me, even though I know you wish you could. It’s like wanting to help me for a test, but then doing all the studying for me. If I don’t have the knowledge to take the test, I can’t pass it myself. This is very similar.”  , To have a conversation that both speakers can feel good about at the end, they have to be working towards building the “common ground,” or the common knowledge between them.Think about what you want out of the conversation and how you want your friend to respond. In all likelihood, your friend will want to help you, so plan ways to let your friend know how to do so in the best way possible.   For example, do you need your friend to “just” listen and be someone you can talk to? Do you need to ask for help with getting to and from treatment? Do you need someone to help you manage everyday tasks, like cooking, cleaning, and laundry? Know that your friend might only be able to help you out in small ways, so it’s best to go into the conversation a clear sense of what you want from a friend. You could also wait for your friend to ask if and how she could help you, and then discuss whether or not your friend could contribute in the way you need her to. For instance, you could ask your friend to speak with you for a few minutes every night to help you with your insomnia (a symptom of depression), check in with you to see how your day went, or to check to see if you took your medication that day.  Taking notes can help you gather your thoughts and organize them.   Once you've written it down, practice saying it out loud in front of a mirror.  Ask a someone you trust who is already informed about your situation, such as a parent or therapist, to practice the conversation with you. Role-playing the conversation can help you prepare. In the role-play, you'll act out potential scenarios; you will be yourself in the role-play, and your partner will play the role of your friend.React to whatever the other person says, even if you think it is ridiculous or unlikely to happen. Just practicing responding to absurd or surprising statements from a friend can give you the confidence to approach a difficult conversation like this one. To get the most out of the role-play, be as realistic as possible in your responses. Incorporate non-verbal communication into your role-play. Remember that gestures, posture, and tone of voice are a major factor in your conversation. After the role-play, ask your partner for feedback, telling you what worked well and some areas where you might think more about what you will say or otherwise improve your response.  You can take her to lunch, or go for a walk somewhere you both enjoy. Research has shown that mildly depressed people’s moods improve when a task diverts attention to something external such as an activity.Being in a better mood can make it easier for you to be able to open up and talk about your feelings. If you don’t feel up to an activity, don’t feel pressure to plan one. A conversation over a cup of tea at the kitchen table or on the couch can suffice.  The best way to start is to tell her that you have something important you want to share, so she knows not to take your conversation lightly.   If you don't know how to bring it up or feel uncomfortable, try saying something like, "Hey, I’ve been feeling kind of weird/down/upset lately. Do you think we could talk about it?" Make it clear from the beginning of the conversation whether you want her to listen and hear what you have to say, or want her opinion or suggestions.  Be sure to let your friend know whether what you're telling them is private or if they are permitted to communicate your difficulties to other people on your behalf.  Be as specific and direct as possible. Don't dance around what you need or what you're requesting. It's okay if you get a little tongue-tied and shaky as you talk. Just talking is the hardest part!   If you’re having a hard time dealing with your emotions during the actual conversation, it’s okay to admit this to your friend. Letting them know how hard the conversation is for you might even be helpful to your friend to understand your state of mind and how serious the situation is. If you begin to feel overwhelmed at any point during the conversation, it’s okay to take a break, take a deep breath and gather your thoughts.  If your friend seems uneasy, break the tension by thanking her for being there and listening, or apologizing for taking up her time or having a hard time talking about it (if that is true).   Individuals with depression are sometimes prone to feeling guilty. Guilt can be persistent, but it can also be managed and minimized. If you feel guilty during your conversation, one useful way to manage this perceived guilt is to remember that guilty thoughts are not facts. You are not burdening your friend by sharing your feelings.Your friend is more likely to feel grateful that you trusted her with this information and eager to help your recovery than she is to feel the "burden" you envision.  For your conversation to work, your friend needs to be listening to you completely. There are many ways to hold her attention, including making eye contact, using gesturing and body language (e.g., facing the person, not having your arms or legs crossed), speaking clearly, and avoiding outside distractions (e.g., background noise, people passing, cell phones ringing).   Look for signs of active listening.When a person is listening closely, they are deeply focused, trying to understand what you're saying. Check for cues like eye contact, nodding, or meaningful responses to what you're saying (even "uh-huh" can be meaningful!). People also show that they understand a conversation with their contributions to that conversation. They might repeat or paraphrase what was said, ask follow-up questions, and otherwise be working to keep the conversation going. When people stop understanding or are at a loss for words, they may use filler words. Filler words are “go to” words and can vary from person to person. They may use the same phrases over and over again (e.g., “that is interesting”). They may also trail off (i.e., not finish sentences) or not be working to keep the conversation going. Be aware, however, that these responses can vary from person to person. For example, some people think better when they aren't making eye contact and may deliberately avoid it in order to concentrate on what you are saying. Think about how your friend talks and how she acts when she's paying attention.  When a person (like your friend) wants to help, she wants to know what actions she can take. This is part of human psychology: we feel good when we do something for others. Helpful actions can also alleviate some of the guilt your friend might feel when she sees you in distress. You should talk about your feelings as much as you need to, but it helps to end the conversation with something concrete or specific your friend can help you with. Recall what you had decided to request or hope for when you were preparing for this conversation and tell your friend about that.  Pay attention to your friend and how the conversation is going. When you feel it's time to move on, suggest a different topic or move to end the conversation by saying something like, “We should be getting home,” or, “I’ll let you go, I don’t want to take up too much of your time.”   This move is mostly likely up to you, as your friend may feel uncomfortable ending the conversation.  Although this conversation should be about you, don’t forget your friend will have feelings and they may not always be as you expect (you may want to address this in role-playing as described above).  Your friend may cry or get angry. This is a common response when one is the recipient of another person's upsetting or difficult news.Remember this is a natural response and does not mean you've done anything wrong! This might be a good time to assure your friend that you don't expect them to have all the answers, and that you just need them to listen and be there for you.Don't take anger or crying as a sign of rejection. You can try talking to your friend again another time. Meanwhile, find someone else close to you that you can talk with.  If you're having trouble communicating with your friend or she has an extreme reaction, try the following 4 steps, which are helpful in mediating difficult conversations.Inquiry: Ask and make an observation. You could say, “Have I upset you with this topic? I would like to listen to how you feel.”  Acknowledgment: Summarize what your friend stated. You can really further the conversation along if you can help your friend calm down. Summarizing what your friend said will help your friend feel like someone is listening.  Advocacy: Once you comprehend your friend’s point of view, you are getting close to coming to a mutual understanding. You can take this opportunity to clarify what you’ve learned about depression, or to share with your friend what is appropriate for your friend to do or not do, such as, “Don’t worry. My depression doesn’t have anything to do with how good of a friend you are. You are my best friend, and one of the few reasons I smile these days.”  Problem-solving: By this time, your friend hopefully would have calmed down so you can fulfill your objective. Finish stating what you wanted to state. Have your friend help you find a therapist, help you make therapy appointments, or just to be there to listen to you. If these 4 steps don't work, it may be best to draw the conversation to a close. Your friend may need time to take in the information.  Describing a similar personal experience is their way of showing they understand or can relate to your experience.Depending on the magnitude of this information, this could take your conversation in a whole new direction. If that happens, attend to your friend, but also make sure to bring resolution to your own situation at some point.  Normalizing is when a person attempts to help by trying to make you feel “normal” (e.g., saying, “Everyone I know is depressed”).   Don't take this as a rejection of your problem. Self-disclosure and normalizing are actually good signs, because they mean your friend is trying to connect with you and/or show that you are being accepted.However, don't let your friend's "normalization" tactic prevent you from saying what you need to say! At the moment, it isn't important how many depressed people your friend knows. What is important is that you tell your friend about your OWN feelings and experience. Follow the conversation through to the end.  No matter how well (or badly) things go, once you've finally talked to your best friend, it can be helpful to talk about the conversation with someone, like your therapist or counselor, another close friend, or your parents. They can provide an objective opinion about the conversation and help you process your friend’s responses.  

accept that you are ready and willing to talk about it.  consider who to tell.  pause and think if you're unsure about telling your best friend.  think about what information you want to give your friend.  imagine your friend's possible reactions.  decide what information or response you want in return.  write down what you want to say.  practice the conversation.  plan a casual activity with your friend.  ease into talking about your depression whenever it feels right.  communicate to your friend whether the information is confidential.  say what you have practiced.  help your friend feel comfortable.  keep your friend engaged.  bring resolution to the conversation by deciding on a "next step.",  transition out of the conversation.  don’t forget about your best friend’s feelings.  be ready for potential negative reactions.  change tactics if you feel like the conversation is going in a bad direction.  expect that your friend might disclose information about herself in turn.  know that your friend may “normalize” your situation.  debrief with someone else. 

 The harder your schedule, the better your chances of getting into college. Don't take a class just to try it and if it's too hard you'll drop it; instead do your research beforehand. Talk to students currently taking the class and ask if you can see an assignment. You might even want to try doing the assignment if you have time to see what the class will be like.  If you must drop a class, try to do it before school starts. Most schools have faculty members working year round, so if you call or email your guidance office, someone will probably be available to help you. If you drop during the summer, chances are it won't show up on your transcript.  Once you know what type of school you want to go to, you can schedule accordingly. Check out a couple schools and see what courses you might want to take. College Board has a great search engine where you can compare what you are planning to take with colleges you are considering. You can also line up colleges side by side and compare them (This service is free, but if you want to save your searches, you need to make an account).  If you don't need a study hall, don't take it. Take another class instead. Study halls won't give you credit, and you'll probably be bored a lot of the time. If you decide to take a study hall and you can choose the order of your classes, request a last period study hall. That way you'll have all of your homework assigned. If you have a morning study hall, you'll be more likely to put off homework until the morning, which has its risks. If you are only taking a study hall to get ahead in class rank, realize that colleges don't put as much stock in your class rank as they do your schedule. They'll be far more impressed if you have an extra AP class, but have a .001 lower GPA than you would have had you taken the study hall.  Your advisors job is to keep you on track. He/she will be able to help you choose a schedule that's right for you. Even if you think your schedule is bullet-proof, take it to your advisor to look over and discuss. Your counselor probably knows more about the college admissions process than you do, and will have a different perspective to offer you.  Nobody, your teachers included, wants to sit do AP Chemistry at two in the afternoon after already having dealt with the rest of the day.  You might not end up in the same class as your friends anyway. Especially if the class is taught by multiple teachers at several different times. Undoubtedly you'll meet new people in your classes and if you don't, you'll have plenty of time to talk to your friends between classes.  If you are able to choose which class period you have a class, try to give yourself an easy class between hard ones. You'll appreciate the break and be refreshed for the next class.  Online classes can help you get ahead, but they can also put a strain on an already difficult schedule. If they are available to you, talk to your counselor to see if they might be right for you.  

take the hardest schedule you can.  drop classes in the summer.  research colleges.  avoid study halls.  maintain communication with your guidance counselor.  schedule your humanities classes for the afternoon.  avoid taking classes just because your friends are taking them.  alternate difficult classes with easier ones.  consider taking an online class. 

 Be sure to add estimated measurements into each side's total to account for the overhangs. Mark these measurements on your diagram.  Add up the square feet you determined for each section. The sum of these numbers if your total square feet of the house, not the roof.  To calculate the square of a roof, take the number of square feet and divide it by 100.  The pitch is how steep the roof is. Pitch is calculated by the roof's rise over its run. Measure from the edge of the roof over 12 inches (12 is the run) and see how many inches up the roof line is (this is the rise). Get a slope multiplier from the chart below. Roof Pitch Slope Multiplier Chart: 2 in 12 = 1.102, 3 in 12 = 1.134, 4 in 12 = 1.159, 5 in 12 = 1.191, 6 in 12 = 1.230, 7 in 12 = 1.274, 8 in 12 = 1.322, 9 in 12 = 1.375, 10 in 12 = 1.432, 11 in 12 = 1.493, 12 in 12 = 1.554.  Take the ground level square figure you came up with and multiply it by the appropriate slope multiplier. This will give you your roof square.  

measure the four sides of the house from the ground using a measuring tape.  get the total square feet.  calculate the number of squares the house is.  determine the pitch of the roof.  get the final roof calculation. 

 Insert all your ingredients into a blender or food processor. Pulse the ingredients until the mixture is smooth and consistent throughout. Add more garlic for a sharper flavor. Make your soup more refreshing by adding a few mint sprigs., This recipe makes a relatively thick soup. If you prefer thinner soup, add water to it a little bit at a time while the mixture is still in the blender. Seal the blender and pulse it to mix in the water. Continue adding water until your preferred consistency is reached.You can make your soup richer and creamier by adding yogurt to it. Do so a little at a time and pulse the sealed blender to mix in the yogurt.  When the consistency of the soup is right, it’s time for a taste test. Use a spoon to sample the flavor of your purslane cucumber soup. Add salt, sugar, and other ingredients as necessary to achieve your desired flavor., Transfer the soup to a serving bowl or storage container. Chill the soup in your refrigerator and serve it as soon as it is cold. When kept in a sealed container, this soup should stay good for three to four days. 

blend your ingredients.  thin the mixture, if necessary.  season the soup to taste.  serve the soup chilled. 

 Most middle schools have a track team, but you can look into teams at YMCA's and local community centers if yours does not.   Talk to previous athletes on the team and make sure that they've had generally positive experiences.; , Track is a big commitment during the season, and most also do individual training during the off season. On average, expect to have 5 days a week practice for about 1.5 to 2 hours. It's also best to have the time to train on your own for at least a month before (see Training).   Track is hard work. Know that practices will be difficult, and competitions nerve wrecking. Be willing to push yourself.  A good pair of running shoes is essential. If you've actively used your running shoes for more than 3 months, replace them. Many shoe stores have assistants who can help you choose a proper pair. At the junior high level, most schools don't allow spikes but check to make sure. Invest in a good pair––they may be a bit pricey but it's worth it in the end.  A watch is crucial to training and the competitive season. You will often do timed interval workouts or go on long runs that need to be precisely timed. Most Walmart and Target stores sell them for roughly $20. They don't need to be really fancy-just make sure they have a stopwatch and timer.  Create a schedule that you can stick to for pre-season training. Tack this up somewhere where you'll be reminded to train. In order to create this schedule look to the following steps.  If you're a beginner at running start out with 30-minute intervals of walking and running. Work hard, and slowly increase the amount of running time to a non-stop 30 minutes. Once you've achieved this incorporate increasing intensity workouts and tougher terrain.   To start, try 4 to 5 minutes run/jog, 1 to 2 minutes walk for 25 to 30 minutes. For beginning workouts, try run fast for 1 minute regular pace for 3 minutes for 30 minutes. Then gradually increase the running fast time. Start by running 2 days a week.  If you've previously participated in XC or Track or already run Congrats!, you have a bit of a head start.   Alternate long runs 40 to 60 minutes and workout days. Finish long runs with hill sprints or accelerators. Run 6 days a week.  

choose a team and make sure you're interested and committed to track.  make sure you have the time.  get running shoes.  get a watch.  make a training calendar.  train as a beginner.  train for medium to advanced. 

 You can be practically anything such as wild, shy, sweet, rebellious, funny, punky, unique, etc. Pick one or two that fit you as you are now. You can even go with a unique form of scene.; , Get into the scene vibe before it takes over your look. You can be very random if you'd like. Make sure everyone hears every word you say. Scene chicks are very confident with themselves, so embrace your flaws and know that you're pretty! Don't care what others think about you, just be you and be outgoing. Be original--that's what scene's all about.  Start finding some clothes that look scene-ish. For the top, cartoon tees are really popular among scenes. Band Tees are also a big hit. Shirts that say random sayings are really popular too. At this age, you have an advantage because you can most likely fit into both girls' sizes and juniors'/women' sizes. Hot Topic is the main place you'd find sweet clothes, but if you still fit into kids' sizes, try Justice. Don't go to any preppy stores like Abercrombie, Hollister, or Gap.You can also check out thrift stores where you can get amazing bargains. Grab a few hoodies--some plain ones and/or patterned ones look cool. You could also try Four Leaf Clothing, Darkside Clothing, Blue Banana, and more.  Skinny jeans are a must! Black and denim are usually the ones available in kids' sizes, but if you're really tall, Hot Topic, Vans, and some more places have awesome colored and patterned skinny jeans that are so scene. You can also wear skirts and colorful tutus. Make sure the skirts don't go below your knees and wear leggings. It's never a bad time. Wear your tutu to the grocery store.  Some really scene-like shoes are Converse, Vans, and ballet flats in "happy" colors. These include hot pink, neon green, orange, yellow, turquoise, and deep purple. To make your Converse look neat, use some awesome laces. Steer clear of flip-flops, unless you're at the beach or pool. You can grab a white pair of converse and paint a totally random pattern on it yourself for a more unique look.  Remember those colorful necklaces you wore when you played dress-up as a kid? Remember the corny bracelets with the random colors and chunky beads? Rather than throw them away, you could recycle them. Wear them with your new scene attitude. Wear bracelets galore, this means bracelets up and down your arms, and try some cool belts over your shirts. Earrings aren't a big issue, so you can get by with some cool studs.  Most people say scene hair must be long. That's an over statement. You may want the look everyone else has, but short hair is always cute and funky too. Just get really choppy layers, and bangs. Usually, your parents don't mind if you have short or long hair. Stand out.   For hair accessories, try clip-in extensions (they aren't permanent). Most parents, at this age, will probably not let you dye your hair. Some days, you can put little plastic bows in your hair or tie some ribbons in it. Think silly, cute, and colorful. If your parents won't let you dye your hair, talk to them about Kool-aiding it. Kool-aid lasts for 4-7 days, depending on how long or how many times you shower, and it does not damage your hair at all.  Your parents or school may not like the popular, wild scene makeup most scenes wear. Tone down some of it and it should do. That means dust on some eyeshadow in bold colors like purple, green, yellow, pink, or blue. Try a little bit of eyeliner, but only on the top lid. Make it winged a bit going toward your forehead. Just a bit of light pink or clear lip gloss will look nice too.  To be Scene, you have to love the music! Some big music examples are: Blood On The Dance Floor, Brokencyde, Millionaires, I Set My Friends on Fire, Owl City, and Breathe Carolina are just some good examples of scene music. Try looking up bands like the ones listed. If your parents look for the "explicit" label, try buying the clean versions of those songs.  

decide what form of scene you want to be.  personality.  clothes.  bottom.  shoes.  accessories.  hair.  makeup.  music. 

 Just as with someone who is circumcised, you should always wait until the penis is fully erect and ready for sexual activity before attempting to put on the condom. If you try to put a condom on a non-erect penis, it can result in the condom sliding up, down, or off the penis., Place a small drop of water-based lube on the inside of the condom in the reservoir tip before you unroll it. Water-based lubricant can make it easier for you or your partner to roll the condom onto the penis. It can also increase the sensations he feels during sex.Make sure you put just a small amount of lube in the reservoir tip. Using more lube could take up too much space in the reservoir tip, and leave little to no room for semen. Use water-based lube only. An oil-based lube can damage the latex condom, and increase the risk for pregnancy and the transmission of STDs., Before you put the condom on, gently pull back the foreskin. Pull it back until the head of the penis is fully exposed. Remember this is a very sensitive area, so be extra gentle.Pulling back the foreskin will make it easier for you to get the condom on properly.   Generally the foreskin will remain securely retracted one you have rolled it down off the head of the penis. If it rolls back up again before you get the condom, just roll it down and try again.  When you have rolled the foreskin right down the head of the penis it will, in most instances, remain retracted without you having hold it. Once the foreskin is secure below the head you will have both hands free and are ready to put the condom on.   Before you roll the condom down the penis, use one hand to pinch the reservoir tip of the condom. This will help remove air from the condom, and prevent air from getting trapped as you roll on the condom., For some men the foreskin is too tight on the head of the penis to be able to roll all the way down the head. Men who are unable to roll the foreskin down may have a condition known as Phimosis. This in itself is nothing to worry about, and if you cannot roll down the foreskin, then you should just roll the condom down your penis and not worry about rolling down the foreskin.   Whether or not you are able to pull the foreskin back should not increase the likelihood of the condom breaking or slipping. Slipping is normally only an issue when the man has troubling maintaining an erection. If your Phimosis is causing you difficulty, such as pain during sex, infection or impeding urination, there are some treatments available that you can discuss with your doctor., As you pinch the tip of the condom with one hand, use the other hand to roll the condom down to the base of the penis. Your foreskin should remain retracted while you are unrolling the condom.You will be able to release the end of the condom you are pinching as you roll it down the penis.  Once you have rolled the condom down to the base of the penis you can ease the foreskin back over the head. Hold onto the base of the condom with one hand, to prevent the condom from sliding off, and gently push the foreskin back up towards the head of the penis.   This will allow for more free movement of the foreskin during sexual activity, and could even help enhance your partner’s pleasure. 

wait until the penis has become fully erect.  add a drop of lube.  pull back the foreskin.  pinch the reservoir tip of the condom.  know what to do if the foreskin doesn't roll down.  roll the condom down his penis.  push the foreskin gently back toward the tip of the penis. 

 Do not clutter the room with too many unnecessary things. Do not have teddy bears, craft supplies etc. in the room. Store the extra stuff somewhere else until you move into a bigger house.; , No point having multiple dressers which eat up floor space when you can share just one. Separate the closet space for each person.   If you are living out of suitcases, put them under your beds.  If you will be living in one room for a longer period of time, use should use bunk beds. Try to get ones with shelving to reduce use of floor space even further.  It takes less than five minutes to mess up a room. People throw their clothes on the floor, somebody pitches their stuff in without looking because they're in a hurry but you must keep the room clean to reclaim floor space.   Instead of throwing clothes on the floor, put them right back in your dresser or suitcase. Place things on your bed if you need to rush off. Always put things back where they belong.  If someone gets up a lot at night, try to work out a solution. Ask them if they can put a glass of water beside them so they don't have to get up so frequently.  Declare the bedroom a quiet zone, so if you want to make noise, do it outside! This will help anyone who wants to relax and unwind.  No, this is not just for toddlers. Send in one person at a time (or two of the same gender) to get ready for bed. Then have them take their turn in the bathroom while the others use the bedroom. This process can be reversed in the morning.  Everyone has his or her faults, so try to do your best to be patient and tolerant.  

do not have excess possessions.  share a dresser.  use bunk beds.  keep the room clean.  wear earplugs at night if somebody snores.  learn to share space during the day.  set a bedtime routine.  be patient. 

 There are many online ordination programs available. Each has its own philosophy and ideals. Look for a program that speaks to you and go forward with the ordination process.   The Temple of Earth (http://www.templeofearth.com/) emphasizes rationality, beauty, poetry, and humor as part of its manifesto.The Open Ministry (http://www.open-ministry.org/index.php) is non-denominational. The Universal Life Church (http://www.ulc.org/become-a-minister/) upholds diversity and freedom in religion., The ordination forms vary from organization to organization, but they will all require certain pieces of basic information like your name, date of birth, address, email address and phone number, and gender. They might also ask for information about how you first heard about the program.Never provide your Social Security Number to an online ordination program.  To receive your ordination certificate, you’ll usually need to pay a small fee with your credit card or PayPal account. Prices vary widely depending on the organization. While you might pay $75 for ordination within the Church of Spiritual Humanism, programs like the Open Ministry and Universal Life Church offer free ordinations. Compare prices of the various online ordination programs before settling on one.After paying required fee and filling out the necessary forms, wait two to three weeks to receive your ordination certificate in the mail.  Being ordained online could be seen as questionable if you later decide you want to get ordained through a more official body, like a church or Buddhist temple.Some states, furthermore, forbid marriages officiated by individuals who were ordained through online ordination programs.Think carefully about whether online ordination is right for you before going through with it.   You might actually face a legal penalty or fine if you officiate a wedding after being ordained online.

 It's perfectly normal to feel, for a while, like if you don't say that this person is dead, it won't be true. It will always be true and, until you can truly understand through your entire soul that that person is dead, but that death is not the end and that, someday, you will see them again.  

recognize and understand denial is normal. 

 Sinus and post-traumatic headaches are often characterized by inflammation, which occurs when a part of the body becomes reddened, swollen, and painful due to infection or injury. Certain foods can slow down the body’s healing process, increase inflammation and trigger headaches. Some inflammatory foods may also cause digestive problems such as bloating, stomach acid reflux, and constipation. Try to lessen or avoid the following foods:   Refined carbohydrates such as white bread, pastries, and donuts. Fried foods Sugar-sweetened beverages such as soda or energy drinks. Red meat such as veal, ham or steak and processed meats such as hot dogs. Margarine, shortening and lard., While some foods can cause inflammation, certain foods can also help reduce inflammation that may potentially lead to headaches. A Mediterranean diet mostly consists of foods that help reduce inflammation, such as:   Fruits such as strawberries, cherries, and oranges. Nuts like almonds and walnuts. Green leafy vegetables such as spinach or kale which are high in antioxidants. Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, tuna and sardines. Whole grains such as brown rice, quinoa, millet, oatmeal and flax seed. Olive or canola oil, Aim to drink at least eight ounces of water every two hours. Dehydration can often lead to headaches, dizziness, muscle cramps, low blood pressure, changes in body temperature, and seizures. 2 liters of water is the daily recommendation for the average adult. If you drink caffeinated beverages, take 1 liter of water for every cup of caffeine. Non-caffeinated, glucose-free sports drinks with electrolytes can help alleviate dehydration as well., Studies have shown magnesium to be very effective in alleviating head pain. Besides its anti-stress properties, magnesium can also help reduce anxiety, chronic fatigue, chest pain, and maintain healthy blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels.   Natural food sources of magnesium are salmon, mackerel, halibut, tuna, dark chocolate, dark leafy greens, nuts, seeds, brown rice, lentils, soybeans, black beans, chickpeas, avocado, and bananas.Calcium can inhibit the absorption of magnesium supplements, so it is better to use more readily absorbed forms such as magnesium gluconate or a magnesium amino acid chelate. 100mg of magnesium supplements is recommended to be taken 2–3 times daily. Adults should get at least 280–350 mg of magnesium daily.  Vitamin C can be taken as a dietary supplement with a recommended dose of 500 mg split into two or three times daily. Since smoking depletes vitamin C, smokers may need an additional 35 mg per day. You can also add vitamin C-rich foods to your daily diet. Good natural sources of vitamin C are:   Sweet red or green peppers Citrus fruit such as oranges, pomelo, grapefruit, limes or non-concentrated citrus juices. Spinach, broccoli and brussel sprouts Strawberries and raspberries Tomatoes Mango, papaya and cantaloupe, European elder is an immunity-boosting herb also known for its anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. It can also help reduce sinus headaches. Elderberry extract can be found as a syrup, lozenge or dietary capsule supplement at most nutrition or drug stores.You can also steep 3-5 grams of dried elder flower in a cup of boiling water for 10–15 minutes to drink as an herbal tea, up to three times per day.

 We all have egos, and sometimes they get over-inflated. It’s part of human nature to believe others perceive us the same way that we do and that they want to be like us. This may not be the case. Ask your other friends to see if they’ve noticed copying. If they haven’t noticed anything, drop it. If it becomes a more serious situation, they’ll bring it up.; , Reframe the situation: instead of thinking of your friend as copying you, you could take it as your friend admiring your good judgment and taste. Maybe they simply need someone to look up to—especially if they’ve just lost one—and they’ve chosen you. While it might be annoying, it may be a temporary thing. Don’t be too quick to react on this situation because it may result in the loss of a friend., While copying can feel a bit like identity theft, there might be something else bothering you. If this other problem is being projected onto the copying problem, the copying problem seems worse than it truly is. If something else is bothering you, don’t take it out on your friend. Let them have their moment and focus on yourself. Just because they wore the same color shirt as you did to school, or said they had the same favorite meal, doesn’t make them a copier.  Discuss it with them. They might not even realize that they’re copying you. Sit down with them and make sure they’re aware of it and divulge into potential reasons for it. Don’t attack them, make it a discussion.   ”Did you notice that we’ve been matching a lot lately?”  If they say no, give them examples.   ”Do you think it’s funny that we always end up doing the same thing?” ”Why do you think these things happen?”  , Ask them how they describe their style or personality. If they have trouble doing so, it’ll help them see that they’ve been copying you. Remember, it’s likely there will be similarities between you—that’s why you’re friends—but they should also have some original ideas.   ”The whole point of clothes is to highlight your own unique style, how do you think you’d describe your style.” ”How do you see yourself?”  , Give them examples of things they’ve thought of on their own that you liked. Show them that they also have good, original ideas. Be vague when you do this, so that you don’t give away all of your preferences., This is going to be the turning point to make them stop copying you. Once you make them aware of the situation, you need to let them carry the conversation. This will show them that they have the ability to form their own ideas and that will carry over into whatever aspect of life they’ve been copying from you.  If they’ve been copying your outfits, go through their closet with them. Have them create outfits without your help and point out good things about them. If they’ve been copying the way you act, leave it to them to make the first move and agree with whatever they choose. Give them confidence in their decision-making, and they’ll be less likely to copy you., If they truly seem to have difficulty understanding that they’re copying you, don’t tell them your plans. Secrets are never good for a friendship, but you may have to keep some so that they make choices for themselves. Make them decide on upcoming plans and purchases. Don’t give them an answer about where you want to go or what you want to do. Let them do it.  Continue to point out what you like about their style or ideas. Keep in mind that people that copy chronically typical suffer from extreme insecurity. They have low self-esteem. Get your mutual friends in on it to help build their confidence. Support them in every choice they make, even if it seems over the top. This will help them become a confident, independent person., This is an easy way to build self-esteem. When you do something you enjoy doing, it’s something that gives you comfort and confidence. Help your friend do something they like to do every single day. 

figure out if they’re actually copying you.  think about how big of a problem it is.  consider if something else is bothering you.  ask them about it.  talk about their originality.  point out what you like about them.  let them talk.  help them discover their uniqueness.  force them to do their own thing.  build their confidence.  make sure they do things they like to do. 

 It may help you to feel more confident and beautiful with a face full of freckles if you look up celebrities who are known for their freckles.

 Look for a licensed agent or broker who has experience with Nevada real estate.   Make sure you have a "buyers agent" who will protect your interests only. Some agents represent both the seller and the buyer in a transaction, but most real estate experts agree that each part should have their own agent. Sign a brokerage or listing agreement. This will put your expectations and the agent's fee or commission schedule in writing. Find an agent or broker by asking for referrals, performing an Internet search or responding to real estate ads that you find in print or online.; , You can work with a lender to apply for a traditional mortgage or take advantage of Nevada's home lending programs that help certain populations such as teachers and people with disabilities get home loans.   Talk to a reputable lender who can help you apply for the right loan. Start with your local bank or credit union. Apply for a traditional mortgage if you have a solid credit history, verifiable income and a down payment. Discuss your eligibility for federal loan assistance from the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Veteran's Administration (VA) or United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Ask your lender about your eligibility for state assistance. If you are a teacher or educational professional, you may qualify for Nevada's Extra Credit Teacher Home Purchase Program. There are also programs for people with disabilities, or those who care for people with disabilities. Check with the Nevada Housing Finance Agency about requirements for a Nevada's Interest Only PLUS loan. This mortgage is a 35-year loan which requires the home-buyer to pay only interest for the first 5 years of the loan.  Your real estate agent can help you look for homes in the area of Nevada that you would like to buy.   Check listings in your local newspaper if you are not using an agent. Go online to search for homes for sale in the area of Nevada you want to buy. Sites such as Realtor.com provide listings according to zip code, and anyone can search so you do not need an agent. Narrow your search to homes you can afford. Ask your agent to show you houses based on the size, location and other requirements you need or want.  Your agent must present this document to you before you make an offer on a house. It lists the property that the seller will include with the house, such as appliances or furniture. The form must also disclose the condition of the home and any hazards.    Submit a contract of sale. Your agent will help you write and sign a purchase agreement. Your contract will need to include a deposit, usually around $2,000, to indicate that your offer is serious.  The seller or selling agent will either accept your offer or give you a counter offer. Continue to negotiate until you both settle on a price.  You and the seller will decide on a date to close on the sale of the house. Most house sales in Nevada close from 30 to 60 days after the contract is signed by both parties.   Include language about how soon you would like to close in the contract when you make your written offer. The closing is usually contingent upon a successful house inspection and mortgage approval.  A licensed home inspector will look at the house and give you a list of any problems that need to be addressed. The seller can either fix them or offer you a credit towards fixing them after you move in.  Before closing, inspect the property yourself to make sure it is ready for you to move in.  Make sure all of your paperwork is in place and that your mortgage has been approved by the lender.  In Nevada, most insurers will require you to have enough insurance to cover at least 80 percent of the replacement cost of your home.  Attend closing with your real estate agent, an attorney provided by your lender, and the seller or the seller's agent.   Pay your down payment, if you are making one, and your closing costs. Lenders often require a certified check rather than a personal check. Get your keys from the seller. You have successfully purchased a home in Nevada.  

find a real estate agent.  get a mortgage.  look for a house.  review the real estate transfer disclosure statement.  make an offer on the house you want to buy.  negotiate with the seller.  set a closing date.  schedule an inspection.  do a final walk through.  finalize your mortgage.  purchase homeowners insurance.  close on the house. 

 You need to take a risk and just- put yourself out there. If you aren't that confident, just try put a smile on your face and be optimistic. Think that you can do anything- and that would show. Putting a smile on your face is an instant cure for depression and lack of self-confidence - after all, it is almost impossible to see a person smiling happily and feeling un-confident at the same time. Being optimistic improves your life all round, just think positively and try to always find a way to enjoy what you are doing. People like people who are confident and happy.; , What's not to like about someone who likes you? Try making people happy - but stand up for yourself if you need to. Pretend you are a kind of story detective and that everyone you see has some kind of tragic and dramatic story. Start asking subtle questions and get interested in them. Saying a simple 'hi!' immediately gives people an impression of you being friendly.  Just ask a random group of people (that you want to know better) whether you can hang out with them. You don't need to fear rejection, because if you think about it, even the meanest people can't reject you. You can do this anywhere and chances are, the people in that group will start to like you a lot. If you decide that you don't really like them after all, just select another group and do the same.  If you can't open your mouth and talk, just force yourself. It will become easier after a while and shyness gets you nowhere. People can't read your mind; only talking with them gives them understanding of what you think.  Be the best 'you' that you can be. Improve constantly whether in work, writing, good habits...Your friends are there to support you and make you even better and happier, not to change you.  You don't have to be pretty, thin or the next Kate Moss, but you must be approachable. People will never want to be your friend if you shuffle around with a face like you've just eaten a lemon, with snot dripping down your nose, bags under your eyes, obscenely long fingernails that are black with dirt.   If you do have long fingernails and you refuse to cut them, wash them morning and night with soap and a nail brush. File them into a smooth shape, or they will look ugly and misshapen - and if there are rough edges, they will catch and either scratch someone (which stings like a paper cut), or catch on something solid and break. If you're particularly unlucky, both might happen.       Obviously, wash your face every day with warm water and a little facial wash. Especially for girls, wash your hair at the very least twice a week. Washing it every day can remove it's natural oils though, so unless you splash out for special nourishing treatments, every other day should be sufficient.  No-one wants to hang around you if you grumble and moan every minute of the day, muttering about doom and gloom, and how the whole world is ganging up on you. Even if the world is all after you, no-one will be interested. Everyone's favourite subject is themselves. Remember that: ask about things they know about, inquire as to their favourite books/films/colours, but don't talk about yourself all the time.  You're probably in school if you're reading this article, so in class don't wave your hand for every question. People will call you a show off. If you get an A+, don't tell people unless they you ask, and don't go on about it. Just give them a modest smile, tell them your result and ask about theirs. Let them talk as much as they want, and nod. If they got a low grade, or seem disappointed, change the subject. If they need homework help and ask you, help them, but don't do it for them. That is another "taking advantage of you" sort of thing. Being intelligent will give you plenty to talk about.  Most people are drawn to people who are pleasant because those people make them feel happy and good. Try not to criticize or judge anyone, be reassuring and most people would want to tell you things. Complement people if you think they do something well, because - if you have something nice to say, why not say it? This may seem obvious, but it really works. A smile, helping someone with homework, or letting them borrow something really puts you in their good books. Don't take rubbish though - if they take advantage of you, they are not a good choice for a friend. Don't be mean though, just turn your efforts to other, friendlier people.  If you disagree with something, if it's something important - just voice it. Say it in a normal, cheerful way and don't make it personal. Don't attempt to argue, because that just ends two ways. The person feeling right and triumphant and the person feeling hurt and even more convinced that they're right. You lose in both ways, so just say your opinion and leave it. If the person argues, just say 'oh, okay' and move on to another subject.   Don't be very opinionated. If someone likes dogs, and you've just said something like: "Dogs are so disgusting! I hate them - they're gross, lolloping pests that poo everywhere. People who like dogs are idiots!" Especially if the person is popular, often their friends will side with them and ignore you. If you do make this mistake, apologise and explain if you've maybe had a bad memory with a dog attack (but DON'T lie!!!) or tell them you don't know much about dogs, and that's why you don't like them much. Change the subject ASAP.  Ask to sit with someone nice at lunch. Be friendly and smile! Whatever you do, get out there and show the world that you're a nice person to be friends with!  , Don't make friends with popular people because they wear cool clothes and are popular. Do it because you like their character, and how they act toward everyone. Do they act mean towards others, but not towards you? People who are being picked on by these girls or boys could turn out to be really nice friends, so you may want to consider dropping out if they really aren't nice to anyone except for people in their club.  

get some confidence.  talk to someone and be friendly.  hang out with a random group of people.  just do it.  you are you and don't let that change.  look the part.  be positive.  be clever, but not obviously.  be nice.  be neutral.  share a cookie or a loan and extra pencil.  be true to yourself. 

 Vitamins and minerals can also be added to your dog's diet to help boost their immune system. For instance, vitamin C and vitamin E include antioxidants that may help to increase immunity to age related illnesses. There are a number of products available that include vitamins and minerals that help immune system functioning in dogs. While many vitamin and mineral supplements are safe, it is possible to overdose your pet and make them sick. Check with your vet about proper dosages before giving your dog additional vitamin and mineral supplements. Ask your vet which vitamin and mineral supplements they use and recommend. Read directions and administer supplements as directed by your vet.  Probiotics help maintain your dog's "good" bacteria in their gut, which helps protect them against infections from "bad" bacteria. They also improve the overall functioning of the digestive system.Give your dog probiotic tablets, which can be purchased at a local pet store or veterinary clinic. You can also give your dog yogurt or kefir, which include probiotics that help to support the immune system.Always talk with your vet before giving your dog probiotics.  

provide additional vitamins and minerals.  give your senior dog probiotics. 

 You should be able to ask these questions, either to someone you know or to a stranger, and accept "no" for an answer. Write requests that you are likely to be turned down for, so that you can win more quickly. Here are some examples:   A good discount on purchases of services or products Sell something to them for a rather high price Play a sports game in a stranger's yard Take a picture with a person (for no reason) Piece of chewing gum Ride in their car Get a date Phone number; , Ask for something that you expect to be turned down for, because if the answer is "yes," it doesn't count. In order to win the 30-Day Challenge, you must experience at least 1 rejection per day for 30 days.If someone says yes, it means you haven't won yet! Grab another card or find a different person to ask. If someone says no, you won! Nod graciously, accept the answer, and walk away in triumph.  Be conscious of the other person's boundaries, and make it clear that this is a casual request (with no pressure).   Keep all your requests and comments respectful of the other person's body. Don't say anything sexual or rude about their appearance. Take no for an answer. If the person says no, say "okay," shrug your shoulders, and walk away. Recognize that some people have a very strong sense of stranger danger (particularly more vulnerable groups, such as women and disabled people). If the person seems too uncomfortable, apologize and leave.  Try holding a practice session by explaining the game to a family member, and having them reject a request. Then move on to the request that feels least stressful to you (for example, maybe you want to ask your dad to let you sit shotgun today).  This may be difficult if you are usually afraid of rejection. Give yourself a little extra pampering and remind yourself that it's okay. It will get easier with practice. As you improve, you will begin to get used to strange looks, rude comments from grumpy people, and outright dismissal of everything you’re "trying" to achieve.  Rejection therapy can help you become braver and more emotionally resilient, because you will become better able to handle a "no." The official website defines the "Five Objectives of The Rejection Therapy Game" as:Be more aware of how irrational social fears control and restrict our lives Smash the tyranny of fear and reap the treasures (treasures include wealth, relationships and self-confidence) Learn from, and even enjoy each and every new rejection Do not be attached to outcomes, especially when it involves the free agency of other people Permit yourself to fail  , Use and reuse your questions, on different people, one by one. Watch yourself become a stronger, braver person. By hearing enough "nos," you'll learn to make more requests about things that actually matter to you, which will sooner or later lead to hearing "yes."  

write requests on index cards.  grab a card and try to get rejected.  be considerate and polite with your requests.  start small.  cope with the no.  recognize what you have to gain.  keep practicing. 

 This type of corkscrew will have two long levers (the “wings”) positioned on the sides of a center ring. Inside the ring there will be a long metal spiral (the “worm”), controlled by a tab at the top that can be twisted. Start by lowering the wings toward the center ring. The worm should lower as well., The center ring will be just a little wider than the opening of a standard wine bottle, so it should fit easily. The wings should stay down.If the opening of your wine bottle is covered in foil, remove this first.  The sharp tip of the worm will pierce the cork. As you turn the tab, the worm will continue to wind its way into the cork. Keep turning gently until the wings are raised all the way up toward the tab., Grasp the levers with one or both hands and gently lower them back towards the sides of the corkscrew and the bottle. As you push them down, the cork will start to come out like magic! If the cork doesn’t come quite all the way out, gently twist and rock it side to side until it is fully removed. Enjoy your wine!Use your free hand to hold the bottle in place if you have to pull the cork out at all. Don’t forget to to unscrew the cork from the worm before putting your corkscrew away.  

lower the corkscrew’s levers.  place the center ring over the cork.  turn the center tab clockwise.  fold the levers back down. 

 It has to be unique, bold, and all your own! Think Taylor Swift's sweet, country girl style with those curly blond locks. Or Justin Bieber's famous hair flip. Or Lady Gaga's wild, totally unique fashion style. When it comes to your own, play to your strengths! Do you have curly hair? Set it free! Blond hair? Go platinum! Don't be afraid to be bold and creative.; , Put your heart and soul into it; if it's cheerleading, find a way to make yourself captain. If it's singing, join the choir/glee club and rock the stage! Whatever it is, own it!  , What's the point in being the center of attention if it's for all the rumors you spread? When you meet someone, smile and try to act interested in what the other person has to say. Make friends with everyone, not just the popular people.  Don't post sloppy messages with tons of slang and horrible grammar. Not saying you have to be the grammar police, but make sure your posts and comments are readable, and look at least somewhat professional. Don't overload on the emoticons, and don't be one of those people who posts what their doing every five minutes. Two or three posts a week should do it, but make sure you actually have something to say, not just "I'm bored".  A celebrity is constantly in the spotlight! Even though it may be hard sometimes, maintaining a cool head and pleasant disposition will increase people's respect of you. Try to give good advice. (Just don't become an Agony Aunt.)  , Though it may seem cool on people like Ke$ha, that sort of thing can ruin your whole life. Plus, if you really want to make it big someday, it's going to be kind of hard from inside a jail cell!  

develop a signature look.  if you have a talent, go for it!,  always be nice and considerate to everyone.  get in touch with all of the big social networking sites; facebook, instagram, twitter, etc.  keep your attitude in check at all times.  don't do stupid things like drinking and driving, or any other drugs. 

 If the leather is naked or aniline, it has no protective treatment, and will need to be cleaned by a professional. Wet a paper towel, and let one drop of water fall onto the leather. If it soaks into the leather instantly, do not attempt to clean it yourself. If it remains in a bead on the surface, however, the leather can withstand home treatment., If it is a fresh, still-wet stain, you stand a good chance of being able to nip this problem in the bud. If the stain is old and well set, however, the leather will likely need to be professionally re-dyed.  Many leather objects come with instructions or a tag that offer instructions for cleaning. This may give you an idea of what will and will not work in removing a stain.  Apply whatever cleaning agent you plan on using to an inconspicuous part of the leather object. It should be an area rarely, if ever, visible. Let it dry, and see how the leather holds up.   Because time is of the essence with leather stains, if the stain is still wet, you may not want to wait for the spot test to fully dry before moving on to the actual stain. This is a bit of a gamble, so you need to weigh your concerns about doing further damage by cleaning against your concerns about allowing the stain to set. There is no single right answer, as the right course of action varies from leather to leather.  

see if the leather is finished or unfinished.  evaluate how old the stain is.  consult the instructions.  do a spot test. 

 Open a word processing document and set the font to a readable size and style. Play around to find something that most people could read comfortably. Times New Roman 12 point works for many people.   Because you will probably use the lease agreement form more than once, set it up as a template. Insert blank lines for information that will change from lease to lease, such as the lessee’s name or the amount of the lease payment.; , At the top of the page type “Equipment Lease” and center it between the left- and right-hand margins.You can make the title larger than the rest of the text or put it in bold so that it stands out from the rest of the document.  In the first paragraph, you want to identify yourself as the “lessor” and the person leasing from you as the “lessee.” Also include the date of the agreement.   Sample language could read: “This Lease Agreement (‘Agreement’), entered on , between (‘Lessor’) and (‘Lessee’), referred to collectively as the ‘Parties.’”, Your recitals summarize why you have entered into the agreement. These are typically your “whereas” clauses and can be sentence fragments.   A basic recital could read: “Whereas Lessor desires to lease personal property to Lessee, and Lessee desires to lease personal property from Lessor. Now, in consideration of their mutual promises, the Parties agree to the following.”, Start out by giving the lessee an explicit grant of a lease. Also describe the equipment being leased in sufficient detail so you can identify it. For example, if you are leasing a vehicle, include the year, make, ID or serial number, license plate number, and odometer reading.You want to be able to identify the equipment leased by reading the lease agreement.   Sample language could read: “Lessor leases to Lessee the following equipment: (‘Equipment’).”, You should provide a start date and an end date. You can also state whether or not the lease will renew automatically., If the lessee has to make payment monthly, then you should also state when the lease amount is due. Also state where the payments should be sent.   Sample language could read: “Lessee agrees to pay to Lessor as rent the amount of (‘Rent’) each month in advance on the first day of the month. Rent payments should be delivered to .”, You might want the lessee to deposit a certain amount of money before taking possession of the equipment. This is called a “security deposit.” The security deposit could be used to repair the equipment if it is returned damaged. You can request a security deposit, although you don’t have to.   A sample provision could read: “A deposit of is required before Lessee takes possession. Lessor will refund the deposit following Lessee’s fulfillment of all obligations.”, You want the lessee to agree to use the equipment safely and to comply with all laws and rules. By including this promise, you can limit the damage to your equipment.   You could write, “Lessee shall use the Equipment carefully and safely. Lessee promises to comply with all ordinances, rules, laws, and statutes regarding the use of the Equipment, as well as its storage.”, If someone leases the equipment for a long time, then you will want them to know that they have to fix any problems if the equipment breaks. You should include a provision where the lessee agrees to maintain the equipment.   For example, you could write: “At Lessee’s sole expense, Lessee agrees to maintain the Equipment so that it is in good working order and to make repairs during the Lease Term.”, Make sure to state that the lessee should return the equipment in good repair and it good working order. Also make sure to give yourself the authority to state where the equipment should be returned.   A surrender provision could state: “Lessee agrees to return the Equipment to Lesser in good condition, repair, and working order, by the Agreement’s expiration date or an earlier termination. Lessee shall deliver the Equipment at its own expense and cost to a location specified by Lessor.”, You don’t want there to be any confusion that you remain the owner of the equipment even though it is being leased. You can include a provision reminding the lessee that you remain the owner:   “The Equipment is and shall remain the exclusive property of Lessor.”, A warranty is a promise you make about the equipment at the time of forming the agreement. For example, you might warrant that the equipment is fit for the particular use you have advertised it for. In other words, a lawn mower you lease is fit to actually cut the grass. You can limit your exposure to a lawsuit by denying all warranties.   For example, you could write, “Lessor disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.”, The equipment might be destroyed or otherwise damaged when in the possession of the lessee. You should assign the risk of loss to the lessee. By doing so, you protect yourself from the lessee suing you for compensation.   A sample risk of loss provision could read: “Lessee assumes and shall bear the entire risk of loss and damage to the Equipment from all causes. No loss or damage to the Equipment shall impair any obligation of Lessee under this Lease.”, You can also protect yourself by requiring the lessee to get insurance for the equipment. For example, a driver should have automobile insurance to cover a leased car. Include a provision requiring insurance.   For example, you could write: “Lessee shall be responsible for maintaining insurance on the Equipment with losses payable to Lessor against theft, collision, fire, and other such risks that are appropriate. Upon request, Lessee will send to Lessor proof of an insurance policy covering the Equipment.”, The lessee might be sued. For example, the lessee might lease a vehicle from you and get in a crash. The lessee can be sued, but you might be sued also since you own the vehicle. With an indemnification provision, the lessee agrees to defend you from any legal claims made against you.   A sample provision could read: “Lessee shall indemnify Lessor against, and hold Lessor harmless, from any and all suits, claims, actions, proceedings, expenses, costs, liabilities and damages, including reasonable costs and attorney’s fees, that arise out of Lessee’s use of Equipment.”, You should define default in your agreement. For example, failure to pay the monthly fee would certainly qualify as default. You should also state what actions you can take if the lessee defaults.   For example, you could write: “Lessee defaults when Lessee fails to make a rent payment within fifteen (15) days after the payment is due, or if Lessee fails to fulfill any other obligation of this Agreement. Upon default, Lessor has the right to any of the following remedies: (1) to demand the entire rent amount due immediately; (2) to sue for all rents and any other payments; (3) to terminate the Agreement; (4) to, without notice, repossess the Equipment, and Lessee waives all damages occasioned by Lessor taking possession; (5) to pursue any other legal remedy.”, Either side might need to contact the other. You can include a notice provision in your agreement. In this provision, you should state how you want to be contacted and give an address where notice can be sent.  An assignment occurs when the lessee makes an agreement with a third party and transfers the lease to that person. For example, the lessee might sell the lease to a third party. You can prevent the lessee from making any assignment.   For example, you should write, “Lessee agrees not to assign this Agreement or its interest in the Equipment without Lessor’s prior written consent.”, If you end up in a lawsuit, then the judge will need to interpret the agreement. You can state what law will govern the lease agreement. Typically, you will choose the state where you are located.   A sample governing law provision could read: “This Lease shall be enforced and construed according to the laws of the State of Michigan.”, If you go to court, then the judge might invalidate a provision of the lease agreement. As a result, the judge could then find the entire agreement invalid. You can prevent this from happening by including a severability clause.   A typical severability clause reads: “If any part of this Agreement is held unenforceable, then the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.”, You can prevent the lessee from claiming to have a prior or side agreement that trumps your written lease agreement. Include a provision stating that the written lease contains your entire agreement.   You can write, “This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the Parties. All prior agreements are merged in, and superseded by, this Agreement. There are no other conditions, understandings, promises, or agreements, whether oral or written, related to this subject matter. This Agreement may be modified only in a writing signed by both Parties.”, Include lines for both your signature and the lessee’s signature. Just above the signature lines, include the following language:   “The parties execute this Agreement as of the day and year written above.”, This article describes a basic equipment lease agreement. Your needs might differ. After completing a draft, you should show it to a business lawyer. The lawyer can look over your draft and advise you if anything is missing or whether some provisions should be changed.   You can find a lawyer by contacting your local or state bar association and asking for a referral. Once you have a referral, call the lawyer and ask to schedule a meeting. Ask how much the lawyer charges.  

format your document.  insert a title.  identify the parties and the date.  include your recitals.  grant a lease.  identify the duration of the lease.  explain the amount for lease payments.  require a security deposit.  put limits on the use of your equipment.  require the lessee to repair the equipment.  include a provision requiring the lessee to surrender the equipment.  clarify that you are the owner.  disclaim all warranties.  assign risk of loss to the lessee.  require insurance.  add an indemnification provision.  define “default.” you can end the lease agreement early if the lessee defaults.  include a notice provision.  prevent assignments of the lease.  state the governing law.  add a severability clause.  state that the lease contains the entire agreement.  insert signature blocks.  show the lease to an attorney. 

   If you can't fit the container in the refrigerator, place ice cubes in the brine as needed to keep the water cold. Put the ice in a sealable plastic bag and place the bag in the brine if you are brining a thick piece of meat or a turkey in a large amount of brine liquid. Keep the piece of meat submerged, if possible. If not, turn the meat occasionally and lengthen the time you brine.  It takes more time to thoroughly brine a thicker piece of meat.   Brine a 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) thick piece of meat in the refrigerator for a half hour; 1 inch (25.4 mm) for 1 hour; 2 inch (50.8 mm) for 3 hours; and 3 inch (76.2 mm) for 8 hours.  

submerge the meat in the brine and refrigerate.  brining time depends on the thickness of the meat and the intensity of the brine. 

 Write on the grey lines in the endorsement area on the back of the check. On the first line, write the name of your business.   For example, write "Jim's Hardware Store" on the first line of the check. Use this method when a check is made out to your business rather than just to you.  If you want to add any restrictions, then you can do this before signing the check. Just like personal checks, you can add a restrictive endorsement to your business check, indicating you only want it deposited at the business' bank in a specific account, or you can transfer the rights to the check from the business to another individual or business.   For example, writing "For Deposit Only" with your bank and account number ensures the check can only be deposited in one of your business' accounts. If you want to transfer the check, you can write "Pay to the Order of" and the name of another person or business. Once you have written the transfer endorsement, the transferee must endorse the check in order to cash or deposit it.  If you have not added a restriction, such as "For Deposit Only," this creates an unrestricted endorsement on your business check, meaning that anyone who has access to the check can cash or deposit the check.   For example, you can write "James Smith, Owner" beneath your business name. For your endorsement of a business check to be valid, you must be authorized by the business to do so. Your business account will include the names of the authorized agents, who can make payments and deposits on behalf of the business. Remember not to add the endorsement until you are ready to cash the check, to protect your check from theft. Once you have signed the check with your title and business name, anyone who has access to the check can cash it as the holder.  

endorse the check with your business information.  add any restrictive endorsements.  write your name and title.

 The Irish Water Spaniel is the tallest breed in the spaniel family. Measure the dog’s height- males are generally 22-24 inches tall, as measured at the shoulder, while females are 21-23 inches tall.In less typical cases, an Irish Water Spaniel can grow to 26 inches tall., Weigh the dog to see if its mass is in keeping with the breed’s official standards. Irish Water Spaniels are well-built, robust dogs that are considered medium sized. Males weigh between 55-68 pounds, while females generally weigh between 45-58 pounds., You can visually identify an Irish Water Spaniel quite easily by its unique coat. Look for long, loose, liver-colored curls and an overall dense coat of hair. The breed has a topknot- i.e. cascading curls that cover the skull and fall over the top of the head, and ears.Despite its thick coat, the Irish Water Spaniel is known for shedding very little.  The Irish Water Spaniel has long, lobular ears. Note whether the dog’s ears hang close to its head, and if they’re set low. Ears should be covered with thick, long, loose curls of deep brown hair., To identify an Irish Water Spaniel, look for the breed’s distinctive “rat tail”. The tail is low set and tapers to a fine point, reaching just above the point of the hock. The tail is also thick at the root, and the top 2 or 3 inches are covered by the breed’s trademark curls, which stop abruptly and fade into smooth, fine hair., To check for webbed feet, a very distinctive characteristic of the Irish Water Spaniel, observe the dog’s paws closely. The feet should be covered with hair and webbed between the toes, a characteristic that makes the breed excellent at swimming. Feet should also be round spreading.The breed also has tough pads under its feet, which allow it to avoid injury when passing over sharp surfaces like river rocks. 

look at height.  weigh the dog.  check for a curly coat.  look for long, lobular ears.  note its "rat tail".  check for webbed feet. 

 When you begin to worry about something, rather than simply trying to put it away from your mind, set a time limit on how long you will think about it. Actively trying to forget something often makes you think of that thing even more intensely, so don’t try to ignore your feelings. Allow yourself five or ten minutes to think, and then move on to more productive tasks., Another way to place a limit or parameter on your worrying is to find ways to delay it. Perhaps you are in the middle of a very important project but then you start worrying about your children or husband. Commit to finishing at least a portion more of the work that you have to do before you check in or give in to fear.Perhaps you have a presentation to create by tomorrow. Commit to at least creating an outline and some introductory slides before you check in with your family.  When you are on the job or at school, you will need to be as focused as possible so that you can complete the task at hand. You might have some legitimate worries that you will need to attend to later, but if it can wait, consider making a list instead. Once you are finished with all of your work for the day, you can take a look at this list and address anything that is necessary.You might find that your worries have subsided by the end of the day and you may not even need to check this list.  Though some of your worries may be solvable, the bulk of them may not be. When you are feeling particularly stressed about things you cannot control, focus on doing things that you can control. Exercise and yoga are both great opportunities to destress and improve your health. You will often feel less worried after completing these life enriching activities., Work to incorporate more opportunities for spontaneity into your life. If your friends ask to go out tonight, go with them rather than saying you need more time to prepare. Try to be okay with plans or experiences that happen on the fly.Try a new hobby or food. Pick out one fear that you have and then try to conquer it. For instance, perhaps you are afraid of heights. Try going to an indoor skydiving area.  When a worry comes to your mind, consider what evidence you have that would lead you to believe that this worry is real. This will help you assess whether or not your worry is even worth spending time thinking about.For instance, if you call your husband and he doesn’t answer the phone, you might worry that he is cheating. Consider factors like his character, past history with cheating, where he is supposed to be at the moment, and any other information that could negate this notion.  After gathering evidence, consider the likelihood of this action occurring. Often times, the fears that you have may be a bit far fetched or unrealistic. Think about how often this has happened in the past, especially to you.Perhaps your children are currently on a plane to go visit your parents. You might be concerned about a plane crash. However, statistically speaking, planes are highly unlikely to crash and are one of the safest forms of travel.  Take some time to consider what worries you are having and then deem them either as constructive or an unconstructive. This will allow you to know whether or not you should problem solve or let it go.For instance, you might be nervous about a presentation you have coming up. This is good stress because you can use this as an incentive to prepare more. However, you might be worried that you will be a victim of a terrorist attack. Though this concern is real, there is little that you can do in the realm of preventing it. Worrying about it only adds bad stress and fear to your life.  When you are worrying about a particular issue, take a moment to think about whether or not you will care about this issue in a week, month or year. If you will not, try your best to let it go. If it is something that will persist, try to find a way to solve or move past your worry., Rather than catastrophizing ordinary situations, consider all the of the alternatives to your worry. Perhaps your significant other did not answer your phone call and you have not heard from them in an hour or two. Rather than assuming that they have been hurt, consider whether they might be working, napping, or busy at the moment.Call back in a few hours to check in if you are still worried.  After you have taken some time to deescalate the worry in your mind, determine if your worry is at all solvable. You cannot control every situation, but you can control some things, including yourself.For instance, you might be worried that you will be fired soon. Though you cannot prevent this, you can ensure that you are a good employee, that you arrive to work on time, and that you complete all of your assignments with diligence and thoroughness. An example of something you cannot necessarily control is your children’s driving habits. Though you can tell them not to speed, you cannot be with them at all times. Trust them and continue to impart lessons of wisdom to them. Prepare for your worries as much as possible.  Your stress and worry about things you cannot control might be triggered by other people. Maybe you have a friend who is a worrywart about her children and she has pushed some of her negative thinking off on you. Though you can still be friends with people like this, try to spend less alone time with them.If you normally go to lunch once a week, cut it back to once every two weeks.  Another way to combat your worry is talk to people who you trust and who you know have your best interests at heart. Talk about your worries to others and try not to keep this stress locked inside you. Other people can often serve as the voice of reason when you have worries that are unsubstantiated or uncontrollable., Rather than spending so much time in your head, fretting over the future or worrying about what could happen, take some time each day to be present in the moment. When you feel yourself becoming worried, take some time to reflect on how you’re feeling. Notice your surroundings and how you feel in your body. Actively engage in conversations with others rather than drifting away. Focus on living in the now.You might also try sitting quietly and breathing in and out slowly. You might also want to reflect on a single word or idea like “peace.”  

set a time limit on worry.  delay your worrying.  make a list of your worries.  find a way to relax.  learn to accept uncertainty.  gather the evidence.  consider probability.  determine how helpful this worry is.  consider whether the issue will matter in the long-term.  find a more positive way of thinking of the situation.  consider any possible solutions.  spend less time with people who cause you stress.  confide in those you trust.  practice mindfulness. 

 Signs of a seizure can differ in patients and in the way the episodes unfold. The most common types of seizures include convulsions and loss of consciousness. Other symptoms might include arms and legs jerking, mouth trembling or a blank gaze.   Seizures are generally categorized as either partial or primary generalized. Identification is based on cause and point of origination.Partial seizures or simple focal seizures begin in one section rather than the entire brain. Often, the person is aware of what is happening to them. Complex focal seizures affect a larger part of the brain. The person might be confused and have difficulty understanding what's happening to them. Secondary generalized seizures begin as focal and spread to both sides of the brain. The person loses consciousness and convulses. Generalized seizures can come on quickly. Both sides of the brain are affected. Seizures are accompanied by unconsciousness, convulsions, rigidity of muscle and jerky movements.; , Carry the plan with you at all times. You can print out the form and fill it in.You can also use a small notebook for the plan if you like. A Seizure First Aid app for your smartphone is available.Include the names and numbers of your doctors, pharmacies and two emergency contacts. Describe the types of seizures and how they’re manifested. Include their length and how often they occur. Note triggers for the seizure. Provide a first aid plan for treatment. Include how long someone should stay with you, keeping the mouth clear and other details specific to you. List medications, including amounts, when they’re taken and how they’re administered. Refer to other treatments you receive such as VNS. Stipulate when emergency services should be called. Be specific in describing the circumstances such as a seizure that lasts more than five minutes., The primary focus of epilepsy treatment during a seizure is to make sure the person doesn't get injured. In most cases all that’s required is making the person safe and offering comfort. Reassure the person and stay with them until you’re absolutely certain that the seizure has stopped. Stay calm. It will help the person having the seizure to stay calm. It will also help others on the scene not to panic. Help the person to be comfortable. Help them to sit or lie down. Provide a pillow to protect their head., A person suffering a seizure is unable, to some degree, to control their body. Falling or thrashing movements are fairly common. The setting in which they’re having a seizure should be quickly appraised for potential dangers. Minimize the harm a seizure victim can do to themselves.   Move dangerous objects away from the person having the seizure. Steer the person away from potential dangers such as a street or a hot stove. Lead them as gently as possible to a safe area. Don’t forcibly restrain a person having a seizure. It could lead to injury. Don’t place anything in the person's mouth while the seizure is in progress. It may lead to broken teeth. They may choke on the object. Help the person to breath properly. You may need to turn them on their side with the mouth pointed downward to prevent choking.  Although in most cases the help you offer is to protect the person suffering a seizure from hurting themselves, there are some situations that will require you to call for medical help.   If you’re in a public place, have someone else call while you stay with the person who is having the seizure. Call for help if it’s the first time the victim has had a seizure or if the cause of the seizure isn’t known.Call emergency services if the seizures are repeating rather than stopping. If the seizure continues for 5 minutes or more, call emergency services. If the seizure victim is unconscious for 10 minutes or more, call emergency services. Call for emergency help if the person undergoing the seizure requests that you do., Usually, medication will be tried first to lower the occurrences of seizures. Selecting the most effective anti-seizure medication might take time and experimentation. In many cases, once the right medication is found it can be quite effective. Some patients are able to stop taking the medication eventually with no further epileptic episodes.There are many types of epilepsy (over 40) and seizures. There are numerous drugs designed to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures. Your doctor will diagnose your type of epilepsy and treatment options will follow. Antiepileptic drugs are quite successful in preventing seizures as long as they’re taken as prescribed. About fifty percent of patients are able to control their epilepsy over long periods of time. Take your medication regularly. Make it a routine that’s so consistent the chances of forgetting to take medication are nil. Speak to your doctor about identifying triggers, like fatigue, that signal an oncoming seizure.  VNS sends continuous short electrical impulses to the brain through the vagus nerve in the neck. This method can be an alternative if other treatments aren’t working.   A battery is implanted under the skin and is the source of the charge. The doctor will program the battery to deliver an electric impulse every few minutes. The patient will wear a magnet on a wrist band or on the belt and has the ability to produce extra electric stimulation if needed by waving the magnet over the implant. Patients self-administer the electric stimulation when they feel a seizure coming on. In some cases VNS is effective in eliminating or reducing seizures. In others, it’s ineffective., A ketogenic diet can help to reduce the occurrence of seizures.Ketogenic diets are sometimes recommended for children when medications aren't successful.Ketogenic diets are low in carbohydrates and high in fat content. The body breaks down fat for energy (instead of carbohydrates). Ketogenic diets require the dieter receive close supervision to ensure they receive proper nutrition. Side effects from the diet also have to be monitored.  In some cases an underlying condition of the brain is responsible for seizures. Under the right circumstances, surgery can successfully remove areas of the brain responsible for producing seizures.   If seizures begin in the same area of the brain, surgery might be a successful option. If the area of the brain can be removed without doing harm to key functions, such as speech or eyesight, then surgery is an option. Surgery is specialized and complicated and requires tests that may take weeks to be completed. Electrodes may have to be implanted in the brain prior to the surgery to find the source of the seizures since the source will be removed. If no further seizures occur after surgery, the patient has a good chance to live seizure free. In some cases, surgery is not effective., A seizure could come anywhere in the house and at any time. Your seizures may be controlled by medication. It’s still important to prepare for the unexpected by taking a few precautions that will make your home safe.   Place fire alarms on all levels of the house. Use fire retardant materials for your furniture. These precautions help to address the possibility of a seizure while cooking or smoking. Install soft floors. Use cushioned flooring, non-slip linoleum or carpets rather than hard surfaces such as ceramic. Choose non-coarse rug material to avoid rug burns in the event of a prolonged seizure. Cover all hard edges of furniture, or purchase furniture with rounded edges. Use safety glass to avoid injury by shattering glass during a fall. Cover radiators and pipes that could cause burns. Be sure that your heaters are fixed to the wall and not free-standing. Use a low-level bed in your bedroom to cut down on injuries from falls. If you sleep face down purchase a safety pillow which has air holes to prevent suffocation., The kitchen poses a particular threat because of appliances such as stoves which are sources of high heat. Care must be taken to avoid burns incurred during a seizure in the kitchen.   Pans and pots on burners should have handles pointed inward so that you can’t knock them over. Use a wheeled cart to transfer hot plates, platters and pots to the dinner table, rather than carrying them. Install heat-resistant work surfaces so that you can slide hot pots and pans, rather than lift them. Consider using a microwave for your cooking to prevent fires from food cooking too long, and to avoid hot surfaces that could be the source of an injury., The bathroom, like the kitchen poses a special set of risks for someone who falls during a seizure. Make changes to your bathroom with an eye to eliminate the risk of drowning.   Use doors that open either way so that someone can reach you if necessary. You can use an “Occupied” sign on the outside of the door to allow for privacy. Consider flooring made of rubber, or a non-slipping surface rather than a hard surface. A shower is safer than a bath because water drains away. Use toiletries made of plastic rather than glass or ceramic. If you do choose a bath over a shower, it’s best to have someone in the house in case you have a seizure while in the tub. A monitor which allows someone to listen while you’re in the tub is a good precaution. Run a shallow tub and begin with cold water to prevent injury if falling into the tub while the water is running., Protect yourself from Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP), a phenomenon in which a person with epilepsy dies suddenly, usually in her sleep.Though it is not clear why this happens, research shows that in 73% of SUDEP cases, the person was sleeping on her stomach. As a precaution, sleep on your back.Consider a wristwatch, bed alarm, or even a service dog to detect seizures that may occur while you are sleeping., If you live alone, you will need to make some additional adjustments to ensure your safety.   If you wander during seizures, make sure you lock your doors so that you don't go outside.Consider signing up with a medical alert hotline, such as Lifeline. You will be provided with a pendant that can detect if you fall and alert emergency services.Make sure your floor is always clear of any obstacles.Place a chair or some other barrier in front of appliances that could burn you if you fell onto them during a seizure, such as the stove or radiator., The American with Disabilities Act prevents discrimination against people with disabilities including epilepsy. You should be able to live a normal productive life and not be hindered from seeking or maintaining employment.Potential employers can’t ask you if you're epileptic. Your employer should provide a safe environment to accommodate your disability as long as those accommodations are reasonable. Speak to another employee about your disability so that you’ll have someone who can care for you if you have a seizure. Provide your colleague with appropriate guidance literature and instructions about how to care for you. Don’t work to the point of fatigue as that could bring on a seizure. If your shifts are too long, ask your supervisor to cut them back. Avoid high places and machinery with moving parts at work.  Driving can be an essential part of every day life, depending on location. In most states, people who have not had a seizure in three to five years are allowed a license without the obligation to provide a medical report.Keep in mind that your decision affects everyone you encounter on the road.   Stop driving if seizures reoccur. You’ll need to speak to your doctor and your ability to drive will have to be evaluated. If you’ve had a seizure due to an unusual occurrence and have lost your license because of it, you could appeal the decision. You’ll probably have to provide evidence from your doctor that you’re taking medication that he prescribed., Whether you travel by car, plane or train, you and traveling companions should understand the type and frequency of your seizures. Research your path and destination to know the availability of medical help, accommodations to meet your needs, and flexibility in altering travel plans if a seizure occurs.   If you’re seizure free and able to drive safely, confirm there are no problems with the legality of driving. Take frequent breaks if you’re driving. You’ll want to avoid fatigue. Don’t drive at night if you’re photosensitive. If you’re flying, the Aerospace Medical Association recommends you travel with a companion who can care for you in the event of a seizure. Bring a Seizure Plan with you. Also carry a letter from your doctor confirming you’re cleared to fly. Carry your medicines and label them with specific directions in case someone who isn’t familiar with your condition must care for you. Request a seat in the front of the plane where you’re more visible to flight attendants so that you’ll receive immediate attention if needed. 

learn to recognize seizure symptoms.  make a seizure response plan.  apply first aid to the person undergoing a seizure.  protect the person suffering from seizure from accident.  call emergency services if necessary.  talk to your doctor about how you'll treat your epilepsy.  consider vagus nerve stimulation.  change your diet.  talk to your doctor about surgical options.  make your home safe.  take special precautions in the kitchen.  make your bathroom safe.  sleep on your back.  take extra steps if you live alone.  know your rights when it comes to work.  decide whether or not you should drive.  learn to travel safely with epilepsy. 

 Although this might seem like something that would add stress to your life, it can actually be quite comforting for you to know that everything is planned out for when you will not be able to take care of things.Finalizing the plans for getting to the hospital and having everything packed and ready to go makes it much easier to relax and enjoy the last few weeks of pregnancy. After all of the plans are in place, you will have less to worry about and will hopefully be able to relax a bit more.; , This plan should cover your preferences regarding the details of your child’s birth, such as what medication you will be administered, and whether or not your baby will be circumcised, if he is a boy. Many women find it helpful to put their birth plan in writing so that everyone involved in the birthing process is aware of her preferences since she may not be capable of expressing them clearly while giving birth.It is important to also add some clauses about what you prefer if something changes, such as the need for an emergency caesarean if the baby is having difficulties during the birth.  If there are other children in the family or pets in the home, plans should be made for someone to care for them while you are giving birth. This person or persons should be reliable and readily available at any time of day or night.   In addition, unless they volunteer, it is usually best to choose someone besides the immediate family, since they may want to be at the hospital when the baby is born.  Since few babies are actually born when they are expected, it is a good idea for you to clear your calendar for several weeks toward the end of your pregnancy. This means that you should take care of all of your routine appointments, even if it is a little ahead of schedule.   Some appointments to consider are the dentist, hair salon, pediatric appointments for other children in the family, and veterinarian appointments for household pets. Once all of the appointments are finished and out of the way, you will not have to worry about forgetting to call to cancel them when the baby comes.  Another appointment that should be made is a tune up for your vehicle. It is important to be sure that it in good working condition before the baby is born. This includes such things as checking the condition of the wiper blades, which many people don’t consider until there is a problem.  Put in everything that you need for you and your baby. These things include diapers, hygiene products, clothes for you and baby, and towels.Select the clothing that you will wear on your way out of the hospital. Keep in mind that you will most likely have a bunch of pictures taken of you and your baby at that time. Select clothing for your baby. If you want your baby to wear something special for his or her first day in the world, remember to pack it.  

understand that having a plan will help to alleviate stress and worry.  make a birthing plan.  organize for someone to take care of other children or pets.  clear your calendar.  get your car checked out.  pack your bag for the hospital. 

 Some American insurance companies consider genetic screening part of prenatal care, but others consider it optional. Call your health insurance company and find out whether or not they cover carrier genetic screening. If so, it may be free for you. If not, the out of pocket cost may be several hundred dollars.The cost and availability of screenings may vary by country. Ask your doctor or insurance company for details about cost and payment options.  Most likely, your doctor or OB/GYN can perform the test in their office.If not, they will probably be familiar with local professionals who can perform the screening. Ask for suggestions; they may even provide a referral.  Medical Genetics programs also offer carrier screenings. Some companies offer mail-order services. Because of the risk of user error, it’s better to get the test done by a professional. The results should always be read by a trained medical professional.  The test itself is relatively simple, easy, and painless. You will be asked to give a sample of blood or saliva. Your genes will be evaluated from this sample.You will get results in about 2 weeks.  

ask your insurance company if the procedure is covered.  locate a testing center.  give a blood or saliva sample. 

 Everyone has an imagination, but not everyone is good at accessing it. One of the easiest ways to have fun by yourself while tapping into your imagination is to sit down at a table with pens, pencils, markers, or crayons and start drawing. Be sure to set out plenty of scrap paper, and don't hold back: just keep drawing and drawing until you hit on something you like. Expand it, add details (and color, if you have colored items), and keep building on it until you're satisfied.   You don't have to show your doodles to anyone else if you don't want to. Just recycle them when you're finished, if you don't want to keep them.; , Playing with dolls, action figures, and other such figurines is a time-honored children's tradition the world over, and for good reason: It's a great way to pass time when there's nothing else to do. If you don't own toys, you can buy some, make some, or use decorative figurines. Assign each of them a name and title, and move them around to act out stories. Give them distinct voices and personality quirks.   Try using a crumpled blanket or stacked books to create “scenery” for your characters. Perhaps one figure is a lone U.S. Marshal riding down a box canyon made of books, about to be ambushed by a desperado; maybe it's a witch on a broomstick, about to rescue someone from jumping off a bridge. The possibilities are endless.  You're at home alone, so why not? Pick some music, crank the volume, and start shaking to it. You might be surprised how much fun it actually is. Mix things up by putting on music you don't think you could dance to (such as a slow piece of classical music) and try to dance to it anyway. Let your body express the sounds and emotions of the songs. This is a great way to improve your mood and get some exercise, too.   Be sure the front door is locked before you go wild, unless you want someone who lives with you to walk in and see you dancing around crazily. The time it takes them to unlock the door is all the time you need to stop dancing and try to make your face look serious.  Trying to look serious after dancing usually just makes you laugh even harder, but isn't having a good time the whole point?   Clear plenty of space before you dance. Once you begin to get into it, it's easy to lose track of where your body is moving.  This includes one-player variants of social games. The best known one-player game is probably Klondike solitaire, a simple matching game played with cards. Other solitaire card games include Pyramid and Spider. Aside from card games, marbles can be played by yourself, as can checkers and even chess. Obviously, the challenge of such a game is limited, but the chances to learn and practice strategy are plentiful. You can also shoot hoops, throw darts, or practice trick shots in pool by yourself, provided you have the necessary equipment.   Solo marbles is as easy as setting an X of marbles inside a circle, and then taking shots from outside with a larger marble (the taw) and trying to knock out all the small marbles. It can be played indoors, provided you have tape for a square ring and enough smooth flooring to take shots. There is a massive list of solitaire card games available on Wikipedia. Note that not every variant version of these games is actually explained. Proprietary games, such as Magic: the Gathering and other collectible card games, can be played in solo matches in much the same way as chess or checkers. Playing decks against each other is a useful way to test strategies and deck balance. Putting on music in the background is a great way to help time pass quickly while playing a solo game, as well as keep track of how much time has passed. Just make a note of the length of your playlist or album, and you'll know what time it is when it ends.  Today more than ever, video games are everywhere. Even if you don't own a console (such as a Wii or PS3) for playing games, there are many thousands available for your computer and phone. Most of these are designed for one player. Some pit you against other online players; a few are best in the company of friends (especially go-kart racing games and fighting games). Avoid these if you truly want to play by yourself, and look into action-adventure games and role playing games instead.   There are many free games available to play online. Try Yahoo! Games for a large selection of recent and classic titles, or http://www.onemorelevel.com/ for a smaller, curated list that's easy to navigate and includes some lesser-known (but still fun) titles.  Some free games allow you to pay money to unlock extra features or get an edge. Don't pay for anything unless you're 100% sure you want to. Remember, it's just a free Internet game.   Don't discount older game consoles. Many fun games were made for consoles like the NES, Sega Genesis, and original PlayStation. These games, and the systems that play them, can often be bought for a tiny fraction of their original cost from garage sales and thrift shops.  If you have free time and no one to spend it with, why not build or make something for fun? Try gluing and painting a model plane or car, or building a model rocket from a kit and then launching it behind a nearby school over the weekend. Some craft stores even sell kits that allow you to make working robots, grow neon-colored crystals in water, and do a whole range of other fun and offbeat things. Most of these kits cost less than $30, and are a great way to while away an afternoon.   Other kits include sand art, jewelry, and dreamcatcher kits. Shop around and see what's out there! You can also make your own “kit” by purchasing basic parts and keeping them in a box or bag together. Try making your own scented soaps or bath salts, beeswax candles, T-shirt designs (with decals and fabric paint), or even wine (if you're old enough).  

draw something.  play with figurines.  dance.  play one-player games.  play video games.  use a hobby kit.

 Expectorants are herbs that can increase and thin out secretions which makes it easier to cough up the phlegm. Some of these (like camphor, eucalyptus, and menthol) can also be used to suppress coughs. Easy to find herbal expectorants include:EucalyptusElecampane (Inula) Slippery Elm Fennel seed CamphorGarlic Hyssop Lobelia Mullein Thyme Spearmint and peppermint Ginger Cayenne pepper and black pepper Mustard seed  , Steep one teaspoon of dried expectorant herb (or one tablespoon if fresh) in one cup of boiled water for five to 10 minutes. Sip four to six cups of the warm herbal tea throughout the day. If you dislike the taste, you can add honey and lemon. However, do not give honey to children under one year old.   Cayenne pepper, black pepper, garlic, and mustard seed may be strong and irritate your throat so drink them slowly. If you are giving these teas to a child, cut the amount of herb by ½ or steep it in two cups of water. You should also consider talking to your doctor before using herbal remedies in children.  Create an herbal steam using herbs or essential oils to bring the expectorant's antifungal, antibacterial, or antiseptic properties directly to your lungs. Use one drop of essential oil or one to two teaspoons of dried herb for every quart of water. Boil the mixture for one minute and remove it from heat. Use one of these herbs or essential oils:   Eucalyptus Fennel seed Camphor Hyssop Lobelia Mullein Thyme Spearmint or peppermint (which contain menthol) Ginger Coltsfoot Marshmallow Slippery elm  , Drape a large clean towel over the back of your head while you lean over the pot of steaming herbal water. Keep your face at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) away from the water so you don't burn yourself and close your eyes. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth for five counts. Repeat this for 10 minutes or as long as the water is still steaming. Cough during the treatment and blow your nose when you're finished.   Reheat the water till it steams and do a facial every two hours or as often as you can.  Use natural suppressants like camphor, eucalyptus, and honey. Remember, do not give honey to children under one year old. Try taking one tablespoon of honey three times a day to soothe your throat. Or, add one to three drops of camphor, eucalyptus, or menthol into a steam facial, breathing in the fumes. You can also rub a topical ointment that contains camphor and menthol onto your chest and around your nose to suppress your cough.   In general, a cough is a normal way for your body to get rid of mucus and irritants, so you shouldn't always treat it. But, if you're coughing so much that you can't sleep or concentrate, or your body is sore, you can try a natural cough suppressant.  

choose a natural expectorant.  make an herbal expectorant tea.  create a steam facial.  do a steam facial.  suppress your cough.

 It might seem odd to eat before a workout to feel energized after, but it can work. You know your body best, but some people who eat before a morning workout discover they have more energy during and after the workout.A small shake with some whey protein or a piece of fruit is a great option for a small, pre-workout meal.  On the nights before you plan to work out in the morning, go to bed earlier than usual. How early you go to bed should correspond to how early you're waking up for your workout. If you stick to this schedule for the days you want to work out in the morning, your body will get used to it and it can become easier.For example, if you normally go to bed at 10 pm and wake up at 7 am but want to fit in a 30-minute work out in the morning, go to bed at 9:30 pm and wake up at 6:30 am instead.  Your body needs to be warmed up properly before you begin any intense workout. Because your body's temperature is lowest right when you wake up first thing in the morning, you need to make sure you perform a longer warm up than you would if you were working out in the afternoon. You should warm up for about 10 minutes before a morning workout.You can warm up by stretching, walking, and doing jumping jacks without injuring your body.  

eat before your workout.  get enough rest the night before.  warm up for longer than usual. 

 If you haven't worked up a major sweat, a disinfectant wipe may be sufficient to get yourself clean.Some schools are even handing these out to students in gym class instead of requiring a shower. Just bring a pack in your gym bag and wipe down your armpits and other smelly spots.   If you're self-conscious about this, you can wipe yourself down in a bathroom stall.  Stop at your locker to pick up a towel. You can secure the towel around your waist and then slip out of your pants. Remove your shirt next and quickly slide the towel up under your armpits if you want to cover your chest.   You can bring your towel into a bathroom stall and change out of your clothes in the stall. Then emerge already wearing the towel and no one will have seen you change.  If you're going to a neighborhood gym, try not to go during peak hours. During lunch or right after work, there's bound to be tons of people at the gym, and so it's more likely the locker room (and showers) will be crowded. Ask a trainer or the person at the desk when the gym is least crowded, then try to fit your work out in during those hours.   If you're in gym class and trying to avoid showering with your classmates, talk to your teacher and ask if you may shower after everyone else has done so. You can also try to wait the other students out, taking your time so that most other people are finished showering by the time you are ready.  If your school insists on students showering after gym class, talk to a school administrator and see if you can take gym during final period. It will be much easier to talk your teacher or coach into letting you skip the shower if you assure him or her that you're going to rinse off when you get home.   Part of the reason your school wants you to shower is that if students don't clean off after exercising, they may spread serious diseases like MRSA.If you're going straight home after gym, however, the chances of that are slim.  If you are experiencing bullying or terrible anxiety because you have to shower at school, ask your parents to write a note to your teacher.You may have to meet with your gym teacher or a guidance counselor, with or without your parents, but if the situation in severe, you may be excused.  

use disinfectant wipes instead of showering.  wear a towel to and from the shower.  try to shower when very few people are around.  rearrange your schedule if you're a student, making gym your last class of the day.  get a letter from your parents if you can't get comfortable. 

 You will need a dowel rod (with roughly ½” diameter), a second dowel rod or dowel pins (roughly ¼” diameter, as it must fit inside the first dowel rod), a wood spindle (sometimes called a chair spindle or a decorator spindle), wood glue, a saw, sandpaper, and a drill with a bit similar to the dowel pin you use.  This will form the main part of the wand. It can be whatever length you prefer (in Harry Potter, Hagrid’s wand is 16” but some wands are a small as 9”). Measure it and cut it to size using the saw. You can sand and round the tip using the sandpaper if you want to.  The spindle will form the handle. You can usually get two handles from a single spindle. Cut it into whatever pieces you feel are appropriate using the saw.  Drill a hole at the center of both the handle and the main section of the wand where the two will join together, going up into the core of each. Be careful to drill straight and not use a drill bit which is too large for the pin you will place.  Using either a much thinner dowel rod trimmed to size or appropriately sized pre-cut dowel pins, cover the pin in glue and place it in the handle hole. Once it is in place, put the other end into the hole in the main section of the wand. Push them together until they are solidly joined. If there is too much resistance, you can use a hammer or other heavy object to gently tap them into place.  Remove excess glue and sand any rough spots. You can also paint or stain your wand to whatever your desired color may be. You can use tools, such as an awl or screwdriver, to gently tap texture into the wood of the handle (like that on the Elder Wand in Harry Potter). You can also add polymer clay to the wand (before painting or staining) to make it look more like the wands from the films, if you have the skill to sculpt and texture it. Once your desired details are added, you’re done!         

get materials.  trim the dowel rod.  trim the spindle.  make the dowel pinhole.  place the dowel pin.  add any finishing details.

 You can prevent feelings of isolation and loneliness if you expand your social network. One way to do this is to open yourself and learn a new skill or topic.Taking classes or lessons gives you the opportunity to meet people that you might not meet otherwise. It can also keep you from feeling alone and unconnected to others.   For example, take a foreign language class to expose yourself to different cultures and to interact with other people. Try something active like a team sport. This will give you the chance to get some physical activity and widen your social circle.; , This is a way to give back and boost your community as well as support causes you care about. It also helps prevent you from feeling isolated. This is because it gives you the chance to meet people with similar interests and concerns and meet people in your community.Talk to leaders in the community like your religious leader, coach, or a school counselor about ways that you can volunteer. For example, “You might say, I’d like to volunteer, do you have any suggestions?” When possible, volunteer to do things that will allow you to interact with other people. For example, instead of volunteering to stuff envelopes, you might volunteer to meet visitors at an event.  One way that you can connect with others and prevent feelings of isolation is to ask someone close to you to introduce you to new people.Having a mutual friend introduce you to others can help make meeting people less awkward for you.   For example, you might tell your sister, “When we go to the party tonight, would you mind introducing me to a few people since I won’t know anyone?” Or for instance, if you are starting a new job you might ask your HR representative or supervisor to introduce you to key people you may need to know.  In order for you to prevent feelings of isolation and expand your social network, you’ll have to believe that you can meet new people. Believing in yourself will give you the confidence you need to introduce yourself to others and widen your circle of friends.When you meet new people, remind yourself that you are a great person who is capable of making new friends. Try saying, “I believe that I can meet new people. I don’t have to feel isolated or lonely.” Make a list of all the reasons someone would want to spend time with you. For example, you might write, “I’m quirky, thoughtful, interesting, and a great listener.” Give yourself a daily compliment. For instance, when you’re getting dressed in the morning, you could tell yourself, “I’m a great person and I’m going to have a great day with the people around me.”  

learn something new.  volunteer in your community.  ask for an introduction.  believe in yourself. 

 If the phone number you've called is currently busy, hang up the phone before you attempt to redial the number.   Note that this method will only work with landline phones equipped with a “Redial” button. If your phone does not have this feature, you will need to use a different method.; , Pick the phone back up and look for a button marked with the word “Redial.” Press this button and listen to the dial tone.   The phone should automatically redial the last number you dialed. It will not redial the last number to call you, however. If you place the handset next to your ear, you should hear the phone dial and connect to the other line. It will ring as usual if the line is no longer busy, but you will hear a busy tone if the other line is still busy.  If the phone number is still busy, you can hang up and try again later using the same procedure.   There is no limit on the number of times you can redial the last number, so you can continue pressing the redial button until you reach the intended recipient.  

hang up the phone.  pick the phone up and press the “redial” button.  repeat as needed. 

 General Educational Development (GED) certificates will also be sufficient to continue toward a social work degree.; , Your score on the SATs, ACTs or A Levels will determine the universities or colleges where you will be accepted.  This is the most direct way to licensure and entry-level positions within the field.   If you want to be a clinical social worker, you may want to choose a school where you can receive a master's of social work after you finish your bachelor's degree. A graduate degree is necessary to pursue this track.  Your schooling should also include internships or practical application of your skills. Some jobs may require 1 to 2 years of experience in a social work setting.  If you want to work in the health care sector, school system or a clinical setting, this is a necessary step. You can also return to pursue a MSW after working in the field.  Contact the Association of Social Work Boards, at aswb.org, to find your state's requirements.   If you are looking for non-clinical work and your state does not require licensing for this level, you can start to look for entry-level work. You may be able to apply for an optional state license to further your credentials. If you are looking for clinical social worker jobs, licensing is required in all states.  You may also need to show you have completed 3,000 of clinical experience and submit letters of recommendation to be given a state clinical social worker license.    If you have an MSW, you may want to get a credential from the National Association of Social Workers (NASW). There are 3 options through this organization. If you are not a clinical social worker, but you want to specialize in a particular field, such as social work with children, the elderly or another area, there are several specialized social work institutions that give voluntary certification.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics expects the demand for social work jobs to rise by 25 percent until 2020, a rate that is faster than average.  Social work jobs are available through federal and state agencies. You may need to relocate to be a viable candidate at the state offices.  Each state requires its clinical social workers to earn educational credits to keep their license.  You may be able to increase your salary and specialize further by looking for jobs that have more responsibility.  After a decade or more of social work and a specialization, you may be able to move into private practice. People with management experience, project leadership and an MSW are especially qualified for this job transition.  

earn your high school diploma.  take your college entrance exams.  apply to 4-year colleges that offer a bachelor's degree in social work (bsw).  complete your bsw.  consider applying for a master's of social work (msw).  research whether your state requires a license for non-clinical social work.  provide proof of your msw.  consider getting a credential in social work to enhance your resume.  apply for entry-level social work jobs in your area.  consider relocating to a county seat or state capital.  earn continuing education credits.  seek out mid-level and managerial experience after 2 to 5 years of social work.  consider moving to a consultancy or private practice. 

 If you don't have a lot a friends, talk to new people. She may not see you as a threat if you don't have a group.   You don't have to make hundred of friends. Just make a group of people you know and get to know them. Choose close friends. That way, they can back you up and you have friends that will be there for you. Know lot of people. Even if they're not friends, talk to new people so everyone at least knows you and thinks you're a cool person.    Say your name and talk about anything. It's a good idea to read books and watch movies to find topics. Be friendly and bright, or mysterious if you're shy. But be nice! Be natural and don't rack your brain thinking of clever things to say. Witty things will come with not thinking about it. Be fun. You can crack a joke, or do anything funny. Big Tip: If you're doing this when she is around, don't glance to make sure she's watching. Pretend she isn't there, and talk to your friend. Remember,  conversations are to talk about something, not just to make someone jealous.  Do the same! Study and be a good student.   Whether she flunks every test, or is a teacher's pet, do well in your classes. School is meant for learning, after all. If she is a flunker, just do well and ignore her. She'll be jealous of your straight A's.    Participate in class. Ask questions so the teacher (and students) know you're there. Pay attention. If you pay attention, you may find things to point out, or points to make. You're be appreciated for having your own opinions. Ignore her. During class, even if you want to eavesdrop on her for gossip, DON'T. It will look like you're staring at her (awkward) or it will just look weird. Stay focused, it will take stress off having to look popular around her.    If you find other things you like, it will give you new conversation topics. If you find other things you like, it makes you well-rounded. Don't try to like what she likes to beat her at it. If she's on the basketball team, so be it. If you don't like basketball, don't do it. If you like tennis, try out for the tennis team.  

expand your social circle.  make sure you give people the right impression.  is she the kind of girl that talks and makes points in class?,  if she is a good student, here's how to deal with her.  find other interests. 

 The aforementioned calculations, though simple, are easy tools to see how your costs are distributed and find ways to save money. However, you'll need to use the following equation to get your actual fixed costs over time: Fixed Cost = Cost + Depreciation + Interest on Investment + Insurance and TaxesThis helps you see how much you'll be paying into the future on your big fixed costs, like a mortgage or piece of equipment. While it seems complicated, all this really does is tell you how much your equipment would be worth if you quit the business and tried to sell it.   For this section, assume you're looking 10 years into the future. You can, however, set any length of time you'd like.  This is where you input the normal fixed cost. For example, say you bought a postcard printing press worth $10,000. This is the Cost. However, imagine that you are paying for it with a loan, only paying $2,000 a year. You would still put down $10,000 for Cost.   Don't forget to add maintenance and upkeep costs on the press. For simplicity sake, assume here that it is only $100 a year. That means, after 10 years, you pay $1,000 in repairs (10 x $100).  TFC over 10 Years on Printing Press = $11,000 + Depreciation + Interest on Investment + Insurance and Tax  , Ten years from now, you may want to dump the printing press for a new one. Even if you didn't, you need to account for the amount of money you'd sell it for as a cost. This seems weird, at first, but think of it as "spending the money to keep the press." For example, say most Printing Presses are worth $500 after 10 years. By not selling it until then, you're giving up that $9,500 that you could have made by selling it. Thus:    TFC over 10 Years on Printing Press = $11,000 + $9,500 + Interest on Investment + Insurance and Tax.  You might have bought the printing press on loan, meaning you're paying interest on it each time you pay. For simplicity's sake, assume that your interest rate is only 1% a year. After 10 years, you accrue an extra $1,000 of interest. Add it into your cost.    TFC over 10 Years on Printing Press = $11,000 + $9,500 + $1,000 + Insurance and Tax.  You may need to pay $500 a year on your new investment to the IRS, plus an extra $10 a month to keep it ensured ($120 a year). Other costs could be thrown in as well, like an annual safety inspection that you must get for the machine costing $100. This is where you accrue the final costs that you must pay on your printing press over 10 years. So:    TFC over 10 Years on Printing Press = $11,000 + $9,500 + $1,000 + $720.  This is a great way to see the effects of long-term investments. Instead of just seeing your day to day costs, you can plan your long-term strategy around this cost, adjusting the price of your product accordingly.    TFC over 10 Years on Printing Press = $11,000 + $9,500 + $1,000 + $720 = $22,220 

adjust your fixed cost estimates for depreciation, interest, and taxes to determine the health of your business.  input the total cost of the item for "cost.",  find depreciation by estimating what your equipment would be worth when you sell it.  factor in any interest payments made to determine what you actually bought the machine for.  add in the extra payments you must make on the machinery, including insurance and taxes.  add up these costs to get your total fixed cost, the amount of money your machine will cost you over 10 years if you didn't sell it.

 A marketplace website is any website where potential buyers can search through a wide range of items from many different sellers. Many marketplace websites sell a broad range of content, but those that specialize in homemade items or homemade jewelry may make it easier for you to draw the right client base to your online shop.; , Marketplace websites make most of their money by charging fees. Many online market places charge listing fees, which are fees you pay to post an item to the website, and renewal fees, or fees paid to renew a listing if it expires before being sold. Some websites also take a percentage of the money you make from each item you sell. Every marketplace website is different, though, so you must research the fees for each one before signing up.  The majority of marketplace websites will accept the most common methods of payment, but this is not a guarantee. If you have a preferred method of payment, you should first find out which marketplace websites allow that method to be used.  A marketplace website that provides a phone number as well as an email address is more likely to be able to help you if any problems arise. Better customer support will lead to a more pleasant selling experience.  There are still fees involved with having your own website, but if you can generate a lot of sales, the fees will be much smaller than they would be if you continued selling through an online marketplace.   Allow your customers to pay you through a certified, third-party payment service. New customers are more likely to feel safer using a third-party payment group than they would be giving you their credit card information directly. Go the extra mile to make your website look professional. Use webpage software or hire a web designer. Note that you should only switch to your own website once you are able to invest a good deal of time into building your business. Otherwise, the cost of maintaining a website may not be worth it for the amount of sales you generate.  

create an account with a marketplace website.  prepare yourself for the fees involved.in order to make money, you have to spend money, first.  find out what methods of payment you must use.  gauge how easy it will be to contact customer support.  consider starting your own website once your business grows.when you start to develop your own customer base, you can switch over to your own website and most of your customers will follow you there. 

 You can use markers to write these nouns yourself, or use a computer to type them in an extra-large font size, then print them. Choose a color to write the subjects in, such as blue. Cut the paper so each noun is on its own section. For example, write The clown; The dog; The president; The tiger; and Ms. Smith.   Make sure the nouns are either all singular or all plural, so they can all be used with the same verb forms.  The most basic sentence structure lesson can just use subjects (nouns) and predicates (verb phrases). If your students are more advanced, you can add additional sentence components like adverbs or possessive pronouns. Color-code each category of cards differently, to make it easier for the students.For example:   For beginning grammar students, just write predicates in orange, like jumped on the table; laughed; drew a picture; and flew to the moon. For intermediate classes, add adverbs (quickly; happily; loudly), and/or adjectives (silly; red; big). For more advanced classes, break the predicate into verb phrases, and a second stack of noun cards.  After you've printed and cut out the words, laminate them at your school office or a copy shop. This is optional, but will let you keep these cards sturdy and reusable for years, even when young kids are using them.  Pile the cards up by color, in a stack on the floor or in the pockets of a wall organizer. Demonstrate to your class how to take one card from each stack, and put them next to each other to form a "silly sentence." The sentences don't have to be realistic, but they should have all the parts of the sentence in the right order.   For example, The clown jumped on the table. is a good silly sentence, since the subject and predicate are in the right order.  This can be an activity students do in small groups of 3–5, or individually whenever they have play time or individual work time. Have them leave out their sentences for you to check on. Praise the students when they get a sentence right, and help them understand the right order if they make a mistake. If a student loves a sentence he wrote, or if he needs encouragement, you can save his silly sentence on a board for all the students to read and have fun with.  If a student doesn't understand, explain that the sentence can be put together by answering two questions: "Who?" and "did what?".Here's an example:   Teacher: Let's make a sentence about someone doing something. Who did something? Pick a card. Student: (picks "the dog") Teacher: "Great! Let's make a sentence about a dog. What did the dog do? Pick a card that makes sense in this sentence: the dog __." Student: Jumped? Teacher: That's right. Now put these cards next to each other: the dog jumped." Try making a new sentence.  Students who are visual learners, or who enjoy drawing, might be more interested in this game if they get to draw a picture of the silly sentence they came up with.You can also put these pictures up on the wall, so your students can enjoy their silly drawings.  If your students like the silly sentence game, ask them to think of more subjects and predicates (or "nouns and verbs," or "things and actions," depending on the terms the students know). Print these out and bring them to class, so the students can make more silly sentences using their favorite words.  

write sentence subjects on large pieces of paper.  make color-coded cards for other parts of speech.  laminate the cards (optional).  show your students how to make silly sentences.  check on your students' work.  help students out.  have the students draw pictures (optional).  ask your students for suggestions.

 Yes, you heard right: hairspray. It may not be the most glamorous cleaning agent (or it may be glammed-out, depending on your perspective), but some ink incapacitators swear by it. Here's what you do in order to try to remove the stain:   Douse a Q-tip or cotton swab thoroughly in hairspray. Quickly take the Q-tip and attack the spot of the foul. Apply leather cleaner and conditioner to the spot of the foul afterwards. Because hairspray can dry out leather, causing it to begin cracking, it's important to treat the leather after using this method. Repeat until the ink stain is removed.  70% isopropyl alcohol has worked for some leather owners in the past, although it's probably not a preferred method.Soak a Q-tip or cotton swab with a bit of rubbing alcohol before rubbing it on to the stained leather item. Because alcohol is also a drying agent, be sure to couple this approach with leather cleaner and conditioner afterward. Repeat if necessary.  Dampen the tip of a magic eraser and then rub it into the stain. Magic erasers contain a material called melamine foam, which helps remove tricky stains.Finish routine by applying a leather conditioner to the spot using a clean towel.  Some people have succeed at removing ink stains with the help of non acetone-based nail polish removers.Dab a little on a Q-Tip, rub the Q-tip against the stain, and finish with a nice bit of leather cleaner and conditioner to keep the leather from unnecessarily drying out.  

make use of hairspray.  try using isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol.  attack the stain with a magic eraser.  use nail-polish remover — the kind that's not acetone-based.

 Many public libraries have conference rooms that are open for public use, but private libraries or public libraries in smaller towns may not have a conference room within the facility. If your city or county does not have an available room, look for a nearby library that will allow you to set up a club even if you are outside of its district.; , Some libraries may not want more than one library book club to meet on the premises. Others may not mind, but remember that many people who want to be part of a library book club may already be members of the other club or clubs.  Most libraries do not require extensive paperwork to start a new club, but almost all libraries will have some. At the very least, the library will probably ask you to read a list of rules about hosting a club and to sign your name to a sheet of paper, documenting that you read those rules.  Most public libraries are fine with light refreshments, such as punch as cookies, as long as they are kept within the conference room. Not all libraries are fine with it, however, so you should check before deciding whether or not to provide any at your meetings.  Ask yourself if you want a book group that is limited to literary books or to a certain genre, or if you want a group that is open to any genre.  Most book clubs meet about once a month. Meeting on a monthly basis gives most members ample time to read each book. Moreover, a monthly meeting does not overtax library resources.  As a general rule, weekdays work better for more people than weekends. If you want to attract a crowd of retirees or stay-at-home moms, meeting in the late morning or early afternoon works best. If you want to attract teens, you should shoot for the early evening. If you want to attract college students or working adults, the late evening may work even better.   Stick with one set day out of each month, such as the third Tuesday or the fourth Thursday. Go with a day of the week instead of a date, since dates can fall out on the weekend just as easily as they can fall out during the week.        

find a nearby library with a conference room.  ask the library if a book club already meets there.  fill out the necessary paperwork.  ask if the library allows refreshments.  figure out the type of books you plan on reading.  decide how often to meet.  figure out when to meet.

You can braid the top section of hair as you pull it back into a French or waterfall braid, braid just the length of your hair after you pull it back, or braid a section of hair on either side of your head and pull them back to form a crown.Even if you’re an expert at braiding, it’s best to let someone else handle the job on your wedding day. You want your hair to look as pretty possible, and it’s not always possible to braid the back of your hair as neatly as you’d like.  For a pretty Boho look, work some flowers into your half up do. Whether you add braids to your style or not, you can easily stick some wildflowers into your hair when you pull it back. Be sure to use bobby pins to secure the flowers in place, though.Be sure to think about the flowers that will be in your bouquet and other floral arrangements when you’re planning which blooms to weave into your hair. They don’t have to match exactly, but they should have a similar look.  Instead of smooth, sleek curls that have a more glamorous look, pair your half up style with more relaxed beach-inspired waves. Spray your damp hair with a texturizing or sea salt spray, and allow it to dry naturally. Next, use a large curling iron with a barrel that’s approximately 2-inches (5-cm) wide to loosely curl the hair for soft waves.When you’re going beachy waves, curl large sections of hair so the waves will be loose. For the most natural look, alternate between curling the sections toward and away from your face.  

consider your hair type and the venue.  take the length of your hair into account.  think about your veil or headpiece.  get inspiration from your dress.  do a practice run with your stylist.  leave hair straight and sleek.  work with your natural curls.  create a twisted crown.  curl your hair.  choose bejeweled accessories.  pull back your hair on one side.  incorporate braids.  weave flowers into your style.  go for beachy waves.

 Insects, worms, and other animal food is most safely obtained at a pet store or aquarium store, while plant matter should be organically grown away from roadside exhaust. If a local aquarium expert tells you that collecting animals or plants from outdoors is safe in your area, then you may follow her advice. Otherwise, understand that collecting these supplements yourself carries the risk of disease, parasites, or harmful chemicals.  One to three times a week, give your fish frozen or live insects and other animal foods instead of their usual feeding. Always research your fish species' needs or ask an expert before selecting a food, as some foods can transmit disease or cause digestive issues when fed to certain species. Common foods available at pet shops include bloodworms, tubifex worms, daphnia, and brine shrimp. As with any feeding, only provide tiny amounts of food; enough to eat within 30 seconds may be enough for some species.    Warning: Freeze-dried foods are another option, but should only be used occasionally due to the digestive issues large amounts can cause in some species, such as bettas.Avoid live tubifex worms, even ones sold at pet stores and raised on fish farms. They are known to cause diseases in many species, although the frozen variety is typically safe., Herbivores and omnivores will likely be healthier and more colorful if you supplement their diet with the occasional plant matter, and even many carnivorous species can eat plants for useful nutrients. As always, research your fish species online before feeding it a new food. You can attach a piece of vegetable inside the tank with a vegetable clip, or cut it into small pieces to feed to your fish. Be sure to remove any uneaten vegetables within 48 hours, or it will start to rot in your tank.   Carrots, zucchini, cucumbers, carrots, lettuce, and peas are just a few of the vegetables your fish might enjoy. Feed once every few days or as advised for your species. Using spirulina powder, infusoria, algae, or other plant matter sold at aquarium shops is another option, and a necessary one for tiny, juvenile fish too small to eat vegetable pieces. As long as the tank's surface or walls doesn't become overgrown with algae, you may add it according to instructions once or twice a day.  Different animals or vegetables provide different vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. Alternate between two or three types of animal or meat (for carnivorous fish) or vegetables (for other fish) for a better chance at providing all the requirements for healthy fish.  If your fish's bright colors fade, they become less active, or you notice other signs of poor health, your fish may be lacking certain nutrients. It's best to seek expert advice to gain a better idea of which vitamins or minerals your fish needs, or to identify other problems. Fish may need these supplements during times of stress, such as when new fish are introduced to the tank.If you are raising live food yourself, or purchasing live food from pet shops, you may feed them mineral or vitamin supplements which then get digested by the predator fish. This technique is called "gut loading."  , Newborn fish, or fish fry, are often too small to eat ordinary fish food. Because their dietary needs are often different than the adult fish, and they may require feeding every few hours, it's vital to seek specific advice based on the species. Research information online to make sure your fish fry have the best chance of survival.  

obtain these supplements from safe sources.  feed carnivorous fish live or frozen animals.  feed most fish vegetables or algae.  feed your fish a variety of these supplements for greater health.  provide straight vitamins or minerals if you notice problems.  seek specific advice for raising newborn fish. 

 Oral history is a powerful tool for teaching kids about the past. Interviewing Grandma is a great way to not only learn about her life as a young woman, but to pass on family and regional history that might otherwise be lost. Sit down with your child and make a list of questions to ask Grandma about the past. Record the interview using your smartphone and preserve the resulting oral history for future generations.  Grandparents often have lots of old photos lying around that tell tales about a family’s history. Ask your children’s grandparents to locate old family photos and then make copies of the originals. Using the originals, have your children work with their grandparents to create a scrapbook with the photos and any stories Grandpa might want to share.  Learning about their ancestry is an empowering and interesting endeavor for kids. Consider asking your kids’ grandparents to sit down with the children and sketch out a family tree. This will give Grandma an opportunity to share stories about her parents and grandparents that she might not otherwise share.

 Eat whole grain cereals and breads, yogurt, and fresh fruit.Use whole milk for your cereal and to drink, since it keeps you fuller than low-fat or non-fat milk, but make sure to have only 1 cup at each meal.Have fun with breakfast and try different foods. Ask your parents to help you make new dishes on weekends. Go grocery shopping with your parents to help pick out new things to try and to find a healthier alternative to sugary cereals. Look for whole grains on the label and low-sugar options. Eggs are a great breakfast food, as well as a snack. Make hardboiled eggs in the mornings alongside your breakfast egg dish and take them for lunch or a late day snack., A lot of school lunches are full of processed foods and fat. Pack a lunch instead so you know what you are eating. Ask your parents to buy low-fat meats for sandwiches and make them with pita pockets instead of of thick bread. Don’t forget a piece of fresh fruit and low-fat milk., Help your parents make dinner most nights. Even if you have lots of activities after school and get home later, there are so many good, quick recipes for salads that you are sure to find one you like and can help whip up. Or prepare as much as possible ahead of time to make cooking dinner faster.   Help your parents prepare fresh ingredients on the weekends so they are ready to put together on busy evenings. Make cooking for the week a family fun activity by preparing several meals on Sundays and freezing some for the end of the week.  Instead of sugary desserts, have some berries with yogurt or a little whipped cream. Ask for sorbet or juice bars instead of ice cream.Dip oranges in melted dark chocolate for a rich, chocolaty treat.Find fun recipes for healthier versions of your favorite desserts online. Sometimes just substituting a couple ingredients makes a huge difference.For example, you can make a healthy version of strawberry cheesecake with yogurt, cottage cheese and pretzels., Put some mint and cucumber slices in your water, or a few blueberries and orange slice. Use sparkling water and an ounce or two of fruit juice instead of drinking sugary juice alone. Put chopped fruit in ice cube trays with a little water and freeze for later.Even 100% juice is mostly sugar because pressing the fruit into a liquid strains out the fiber—the healthiest part! Soda is so sweet that it triggers your body to crave more sugar, and makes you need more to taste it. Even diet soda isn’t good for you, since it still tastes very sweet to your body.Try green tea with a little honey, hot or cold. Tea provides a lot of antioxidants that make it healthy for you, and you might even like it plain., Low-fat cheese is a great snack and is also portable. Incorporate fruit by eating sliced apples with peanut butter.Or put some fresh fruit in low-fat yogurt for a refrigerated snack. Try a pita with hummus, or a handful of nuts.   Check labels on peanut butter to find an all-natural one without added sugar. Buy plain yogurt instead of the kind with fruit or flavors added since they contain a lot of sugar. Add your own fruit and, if you need a little more taste, some locally produced honey.Use almonds or walnuts to make a trail mix with dried fruit and granola. Just make sure not to eat more than a couple handfuls a day to avoid overdoing it on calories. 

eat breakfast every day.  bring lunch to school.  make dinner instead of eating fast food.  choose healthier desserts.  try flavored waters instead of soda or juice.  eat healthy snacks between meals and before exercising.

 Understand that "Har Megiddo" may be translated "Mountain of the Gathering," (with some revealing overtones of "uncertain," if you dig further into "Har" ), and is not a place, as can be noted in the first lexicon reference, "Har-Magedon, a mountain of unc. location," where "unc" means "uncertain." Or rather, it is a place, but is given to be interpreted spiritually; it is a spiritual place, the same way that heaven is a spiritual place--or state of being--meaning that there is no "place" called heaven, which the Bible is very clear about (Luke 17:20 {et al} “The kingdom of God is not coming with something observable; 21no one will say, ‘Look here! ’ or ‘There! ’ For you see, the kingdom of God is among you.” Now Megiddo is a real place, , so we'll include the lexicon for it, mostly because you might wish to dig into "gadad," from which Megiddo is derived, mostly because it includes some interesting overtones of self-immolation, or "you brought this upon yourself," pretty much exactly like a father responding to one of their children in the situations that we all experience. So, if you can accept that Jerusalem is the spiritual center, the lexicon informs us that Megiddo was an ancient fortress town, even before David and Solomon. While the literal stuff of your nightmares may surely come true, to God Armageddon is just the human struggle between the spiritual center, where He balances His "foot," and the forces of the earthly king that God warned us we would be sorry about in 1 Samuel 8. The 'waters' or 'sea' in the Bible represents 'people', and 'mountain' (usually reserved for God) here represents the place that the people who have 'risen up' from the 'waters' (or those seeking God) gather; which is why it is occurring right at the edge of the spiritual center of the universe in The Revelation. Thus, "Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon" in Rev 16:16, can easily be interpreted as "Then they (the evil spirits) gathered the kings (the people running things) together to the place that is known as the king's fortress--just north of where the 'soldiers' {of God} gather, a spiritual place, derived from the lexicon. For lack of a handier Christian metaphor, The Mahatma's famous quote, “First they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you, and then you win” may be one perfectly valid reflection of Armageddon, in the context of "The Revelation of Christ," whereas the more literal popular alternative suggests followers of Christ gathering for a violent confrontation, and killing or being killed. Yes, the blood will flow up to a horse's bridle; signifying the blood of all who died, and likely not just those killed in one epic literal battle.; , It is a spiritual war for the center (but as a corollary, the culturally accepted definition, or scenario, has happened in the past, at Har Megiddo {we're talking about the plains of Megiddo, now}; strange and terrible wars they would be to us, and not easily comprehended; Genesis 1:2 "The earth was formless and void" is better interpreted "the earth became void, unless we are to believe that God creates void, formlessness, and chaos. A lexicon of this verse, at the word "was," illuminates this concept, down at "was, hayah (haw-yaw), to exist, i.e. be or become, come to pass (always emphatic, and not a mere copula or auxiliary)--where we accept "exist" or "be," while "become" or "come to pass" is surely the correct interpretation, and also by following "tohu" at the top, clicking on "8414" yields "chaos (1), confusion (1), desolation (1), emptiness (1), empty space (1), formless (2), futile (2), futile things (1), meaningless (2), meaningless arguments (1), nothing (2), waste (3), waste place (2), as well as following "vavohu, 924," so the common interpretation suggests that God made "confusion, chaos" etc, which is anathema to God of course. But the point is that there were all kinds of things, giants, etc, present at one time, that seem like fiction to us now. The war is always at the center of a thing--you don't plot to overturn by raiding an outpost. And furthermore, there is no struggle where God or heaven is concerned. The fight is in you, for the earth. Although the fight spills into the physical plane, it is not a physical fight. There were wars even before man arrived on the scene, in other 'centers,' and not for just the earth; but they do not concern us now. What is important now is that those "angels of death" have always been, and will always be, as long as there is 'free will'; they aren't some satanic horde, except that which is released by man. If you are even reading this, you must care somewhat about discernment; and are surely aware that satan has no power, but what we give him.The Four Horsemen is us ("4" being the cardinal Directions away from Center),as far from our center as we can get. Think Avarice, Greed, Vanity, etc., and recognize that we are all in this together, regardless of any personal desire to the contrary. In other words, it is easy to personally justify how disconnected from evil you think you are, yet still be in complete slavery to the worldly system. You use petro-dollars, right? Yet tares grow with wheat. It rains on the evil and the good. As a connected aside, this speaks to what is meant in the Bible by "witnessing" -- you are called out of "the world" (ego, materialism), while still being an example for the world. "Witnessing" is misinterpreted by many Christians to mean that they are to ask people "Do you know Jesus Christ as your Personal Lord and Savior?". Recognize that Jesus never cornered anyone in this manner. The Bible admonishes those who would have their "ship" in a "safe harbor." Proselytizing may be viewed as a sanctimonious and self-serving way to justify fence-sitting, while keeping your ship in harbor."...let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth." IJohn3:18 While this is usually done in innocence and caring, it is an affront; you are literally doing "satan's" work by using a false representation of Christ to chase people from the coming, new Government (Isa 9:6), especially if you believe that everyone who does not believe exactly like you do is "lost." Understand that God is about spiritual "substance", or what is "central" to you, and it is irrelevant if you call yourself an atheist even, if you then go out and manifest Christ to people. The Parable of the Two Sons reflects this spiritual principle; don't let some guy with a tie tell you it is only about Jews and Gentiles. Read and decide for yourself.  Except possibly in a very limited sense. The Bible even says "no one knows where they go when they die." You don't know where you came, from, or where you are going, and any explanation will amount to words. If either were explained to you, you wouldn't, couldn't fully comprehend; as evidenced by the fact that you would like it explained; and you would cherish a concise explanation above everything you own, probably. And, there is a Book for this, which can be frustrating to read, because you are looking for proof or facts, while It is full of (apparent) contradictions and questions, and Strong Men have interpreted It for the weaker in such a way that you do not accept, but cannot prove wrong, just as they can not prove that "Love your neighbor; this fulfills the law" is all one needs for salvation, the point being that no matter where you come down where Scripture is concerned, you have revealed your heart, which is all God cares about. Of course, being that man was involved, there was a humongous battle for the Book. The battle for the Book continues to this day, and again, it is your battle to fight, to lose or to win. You have a lexicon available to you, and no new translation can obscure it. Every possible faction that has a part in the battle for the earth, has an agenda for you in the fight; but, although the battle is for the earth, it has to be fought with the Book. This is because the Book is Truth, and Truth is your only weapon. Note that you can overcome, and participate in the Kingdom of God without ever reading a Bible; but you are still going to use the principles in It. Truth is also clearly reflected in other books, but this just clouds the issue here. When It was completed, when part II came out, It was locked away for hundreds and hundreds of years, by men, and no one could read It (and they didn't read It, either, of course--they hated It); they would kill you if you did manage to read It, or even if you got caught owning One, these men, and others after them. And that battle still rages today; now It is no longer kept from you physically, there is no need; It is being kept from you spiritually. This was all done in the Name, of course, by people who were convinced that they were doing the Right Thing, the Bible calls them "strongmen." Not being able (or, willing) to see the center of something is the same as not knowing it. You can't see the wind, or the "ether" (nothing), from where everything comes; we don't know what probably 90% of the species on the planet are, right now, or that "the earth" includes all that out there, everything that is physical. To finish, you don't even know where elephants are buried (edit: elephants no longer bury their dead; 40 years ago, this was a mystery, but we've solved it by slaughtering almost all of them); and we probably don't know what Armageddon is, either. Even one hundred years ago, although we dimly understood the thing "vacuum", no scientist on earth could prove how a rocket firing in it would act, or react. There is a point, here, which is to show you, briefly, how much of even the physical plane we, as humans, are "unaware" of. Physicists can't find something like 95% of the matter that they know must exist. You are thus hardly compelled to accept the groupthink--or this interpretation, for that matter--where Armageddon is concerned.  The only thing you can really be certain of is that whatever the herd thinks about a Biblical thing, that is exactly what is not going to happen, by definition. The Bible says that "even the elect would be deceived, if that were possible," and religious people ("Pharisees," then) are deemed "the blind leading the blind." There is no reason to suspect that today's religious hierarchy are anything other than today's "Pharisees."  , It displaces your center in time, toward some imaginary future date...game over! At least until another artifice is needed. Meaning that if you are all plexed up about some coming Apocalypse, you are effectively removed from manifesting Christ. Just like in the war for the Book, the concept of Armageddon was given to you. There is a description of some of the action, sure; and "physical" battles seem to be, and will be, fought. However, Armageddon, for you, will end when you die; your battle is complete, vanquished or Victor. God does not need to send physical armies for the battle for the earth. Because He could wipe it all off with His foot, and start over, except He can't because He gave it to us. Then we gave it away, too, and, left to our own devices, we wouldn't ever get it back, because look we can't even figure out where elephants are buried. And it's real important that we get it back, too, because the earth is where we go; it is our realm, and we have nowhere else to go. If you were raised on the belief that you could "get saved", get "baptized" (by water), then chill 'til you die, and go to Heaven, read this, it's in there somewhere, or even in a Bible, all over the place -- the end of Pr 2, for a start; Is 9:6, all over -- the Bible states explicitly, many times, that the earth is man's realm, and that the Kingdom of God is coming here. You even say it in your prayers; "on earth as it is in Heaven." Luckily for us, despite free will, we have a way to give God permission to act in our realm; prayer. Prayer is the way you make it ok for God to do something in our realm; otherwise, He pretty much won't. We call this "religious", but religion is another thing that we have differing definitions of; among ourselves, and between us and God -- and "religious" prayers are admonished in the Bible -- they are deemed pointless, and not listened to by God. Religion is just another distraction. "Man's attempt to reach God" is the accepted definition. There you go. It is likely just the other side of the coin of politics, and you can't have one without the other; but don't let that convince you that God is religious, just go and read what Christ had to say about religion. Funny thing about the Church, though, is you know exactly what it is, or you...sense it; intimate knowledge of it is inside you, you were born with it, and it cannot be removed; although it can be ignored, despised, refuted, denied. It has nothing to do with religion; It is a collection of "living stones." Despite all your concepts about the Church, which were passed down, 'given' to you; despite the desperate attempt to portray the New Government (Is 9:6) as Religion, Usurper, Oppressor, Whore, or Thief; and despite all the war, and the battles for the Book, you know what the Church is. This is because it is your center; it is that vision, that we all had (or have); that you knew intimately when you were a small child, before what you were "given" removed it to fable. A great description for Heaven may just be "What you thought life would be like when you were a little kid" "I AM" is right next to you, right now, to choose, and does not require anything that you don't have with you, right now. Oh, and you can only, ever choose it right now, because that's all you'll ever have; that's why it's "I AM", and not "I will be", or "I was". "Understand I AM" means you should understand the concept of I AM, the "am" being made emphatic here, not titular, else "Am" would do fine.  This "mark," surely not a physical mark, is placed either on one's "hand," which is what we use to do everything with; or on one's "forehead," which is where we get the idea to do those things ("forehead," specifically, is the seat of our self cognizance, but that is another monologue). And so, "...received the mark of the beast in their hand or forehead" may be interpreted "predisposed to evil in everything they think, and everything they do." And truly, cannot conduct business, or "buying and selling," without this mark; in other words, if you try to make something as well as you are able, and retail it, you are not going to be in business long--you "must" be a slave to profit in order to conduct business.  

know that har megiddo is a spiritual war, for the center.it is a battle for the center of you.  see that armageddon is not necessarily going to ever come in the sense that you comprehend it, almost certainly probably.  recognize that you cannot see the past, or know the future.  witness that people have been looking for 'armageddon' since the moment christ began his ministry.  realize that your definition of armageddon is so untrue, it is a distraction for you.  know the mark of the beast.

Most of the stones below will not become available until after you've captured or defeated Kyogre or Groudon.Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire  Pokémon Mega Stone Stone Location   Beedrill Beedrillite Sea Mauville   Pidgeot Pidgeotite Rustboro City   Slowbro Slowbronite Shoal Cave   Steelix Steelixite Granite Cave   Sceptile Sceptilite Route 120/114   Swampert Swampertite Route 120/114   Sableye Sablenite Sootopolis City   Sharpedo  Sharpedonite  AS - Team Aqua Hideout OR - Battle Resort   Camerupt Cameruptite AS - Battle Resort  OR - Team Magma Hideout    Altaria Altarianite Lilycove City   Glalie Glalitite Shoal Cave    Salamence  Salamencite Meteor Falls   Metagross Metagrossite Pokémon League   Latias Latiasite Littleroot Town   Latios Latiosite Littleroot Town   Rayquaza None (Story) N/A**   Lopunny Lopunnite Mauville City   Gallade Galladite Fallarbor Town   Audino Audinite Battle Resort   Diancie Diancite Pokémon Center*   * To get Diancite, you'll need to have traded a Diancie from X or Y to your Alpha Sapphire or Omega Ruby game. You'll receive the Diancite the next time that you enter a Pokémon Center.** Rayquaza does not use a Mega Stone to Mega Evolve. Instead, it needs to learn the move Dragon Ascent.  If you want your Pokémon to be able to Mega Evolve, it will need to be holding its Mega Stone. You can't do this during battle, so make sure that you've equipped it beforehand., This will cause your Pokémon to perform its Mega evolution. If you have multiple Pokémon that can Mega Evolve, only one is able to per battle. The Pokémon will stay in its Mega form until you have finished the battle or until it is knocked out. You can switch the Pokémon out and then back without having to go through the Mega evolution again. 

defeat norman.  find the mega stones from x and y.  find the new mega stones.  have the correct pokémon hold the mega stone.  choose the "mega evolve" command during battle. 

 To create your own black nail polish, all you will need is a pan of black eyeshadow and some clear nail polish. Make sure that you choose a black color that you will like on your nails.If you want a matte black look, then go for a matte black nail polish. If you want something shimmery, then go for a shimmery black nail polish. Choose a clear or matte top coat for the nail polish. If you use a clear coat, then your black nail polish will be slightly shiny. If you choose a matte top coat, then your nail polish will be matte. You will also need a small container to mix your ingredients together and a stick to mix them with. Try using a Popsicle stick or a cuticle stick.; , When you are ready to start mixing, begin scraping the eyeshadow into your dish. You will need about one to two teaspoons. Use the Popsicle stick to scrape off the top layer of the eyeshadow.         You may want to get a special black eye shadow for the purpose of making your black nail polish, or at least use one that you will not mind breaking into pieces.  If you want to create a matte polish and you did not use a matte clear coat polish, then you can add a couple of teaspoons of corn flour. The corn flour will give the nail polish a matte effect.         If you want to add corn flour then add it to the dish now. Keep in mind that the corn flour might lighten the black color a bit. If you want a true black nail polish, then you may want to skip the corn flour.  Next, pour in the clear coat nail polish and begin mixing the nail polish in with the eyeshadow. Stir the mixture until there are no lumps and the color looks even. This might take a few minutes.  After you have combined the nail polish and eye shadow, it is ready to use! Transfer it into an empty nail polish bottle and try it out. You can use the clear coat nail polish bottle that you emptied to make the black nail polish.         You can use a small funnel or just pour slowly. Make sure that you leave a little space in the bottle for shaking the nail polish. You may not be able to fit all of the nail polish into the container. If there is any nail polish that will not fit, then you can sue it right away or just dispose of it.  

choose a black eyeshadow and clear nail polish.  scrape some of the eyeshadow into a dish.  add corn flour for a matte polish.  mix in the clear nail polish.  transfer your nail polish to the empty bottle. 

 An example is provided called Hello.java :     public class Hello {   public static void main(String[] args) {   System.out.println("Hello World!");    ; , Remember: If you place a variable in the main class, you can reference it anywhere. Choose the type of variable you need.   Integer data types : Used to store integer values like 3, 4, -34 etc  byte short int long   Floating Point data type : Used to store numbers having fractional part like 3.479  float double   Character data type: Used to store characters like 's', 'r', 'g', 'f' etc  char   Boolean data types : Can store either of the two values: true and false  boolean   Reference data types : Used to store references to objects  Array types Object types like String    , Here are examples of how to create and assign a value to each type.   int someNumber = 0;       double someDouble = 635.29;       float someDecimal = 4.43f;       boolean trueFalse = true;       String someSentence = "My dog ate a toy";       char someChar = 'f';        , It is basically "type name = value".    final int someNumber = 35; Adding the 'final' here means that the variable 'someNumber' cannot be changed later  

create a simple java program.  scroll to a place where you want to insert the variable.  create the variable.  understand how this works.  protect variables from being edited later, optionally, by adding "final type name" between the parentheses in the second line of your code (public static void main). 

 Get a thorough understanding of the most important information in your speech by writing your speech in outline form before writing out in its full, complete form. An outline will touch on all the major parts of your speech, thereby making it easier for you to divide your speech into manageable parts later on.   Your outline should include all major ideas and all major supporting ideas. If you have any special examples or analogies you want to use withing your speech, this also warrants a bullet point.; , To cement the speech in your head, you need to write it out in its complete form. This includes the introduction, body, and conclusion of the speech.   You should write out the entire speech even if you do not plan on memorizing it verbatim.  Before using any memorization techniques, you need to speak and hear the speech so that more of your senses are engaged in the memorization practice.   If at all possible, try to read the speech in the place you will deliver it. The acoustics of every room and setting vary somewhat, so reading your speech in the actual delivery location can help you get accustomed to the way your voice will sound from that spot. Additionally, it helps you get comfortable with the layout of the room, making it possible for you to rehearse your movements as well as your words.  Most of your speech will not need to be memorized word-for-word. As a rule of thumb, though, you should at least consider memorizing your introduction and conclusion word-for-word, or as close to it as possible, while aiming to memorize the key ideas and details of your body without memorizing the body material exactly.   Memorizing the introduction can be a good idea because knowing precisely what to say at the beginning of a speech can help calm you down and ease you into the setting. Memorizing the conclusion is also helpful because it prevents you from accidentally falling into a concluding loop, in which you continually repeat information as you try to close. Memorizing the full body of the speech verbatim is generally not recommended, however, because a memorized speech can sound stiff and unnatural.  Regardless of which memorization tactics you use and how effective they are, the most valuable thing you can do for yourself is to practice the speech as often as possible. It's even better if you practice the speech out loud, rather than only trying to recall it in your mind.   For the first couple of practices, you can practice by reading the speech from your notebook or note cards. After the first two to four practices, though, you should start practicing your speech from memory as best as possible. You can refer to your notes when you get stuck, but deliver as much as possible without your notes. Try to practice your speech from memory for at least half of your practices, if not more.  Each main idea or major supporting detail should be granted its own part. In other words, if the information was written as a bullet point in your outline, it gets its own part.   If you did not write an outline or do not like the way your information is organized into bullet points on the outline, you could opt to divide your speech by paragraph instead of by bullet point. The idea is mostly to assign one major idea to each part.  Create a mental image for each part. The more absurd and unique the image is, the easier it will be to recall it later.   For instance, if your speech is about various healthy and beauty uses for organic food products, and a part of your speech mentions that coconut oil can help hair grow faster, you could imagine something like Rapunzel sitting on top of a tower made of coconuts or living in a room filled with coconuts. Rapunzel emphasizes the idea of long hair, while the coconuts help point out the connection to coconut oil. The elements are normal enough but absurd when combined, making it easier to recall them.  In your speech, you need to weave the mental images together. The easiest way to do this is to visualize yourself traveling along various locations, observing the pictures in order.   The location can be near or far; the choice is up to you. Ultimately, though, you should be able to navigate it well enough in your mind to find your way to your various visuals. You could choose something as simple as a forest if many of your visualizations seem to belong outside. Alternatively, you could also use the human body as a map. The images can be “tattooed” onto the body in your mind, and as you travel along the body, you will hit the images in order more naturally.  With the locations and visualizations set, you need to begin practicing your speech by relying on these visuals for guidance. As you practice, actually imagine yourself traveling from location to location, viewing each image in the order that its corresponding bullet point falls within your speech.   You need to have firm links connecting one visualization to the next. If not, you might forget the order your information is supposed to land in. In the example with Rapunzel and the coconuts, you could connect that visual to the one before it by ending with the imagined you having your hair ruined, leading the imagined you to seek advice from someone with long, strong hair.  For small speeches or sections of a speech you want to memorize word-for-word, use the chunking method. Divide the speech into short, manageable chunks that are between two and three sentences long.Take the time to actually mark off each section or chunk of information in your written notes. This can make it easier for you to recall when one part ended and when the next part picks up as you practice, making it harder for you to accidentally forget or leave any parts out.  Practice reciting the first chunk of information out loud, repeating it until you can recall it completely without referring to your notes.   If you get stuck, do not immediately return to your notes. Start from the beginning and try to say the chunk again. If this fails, spend a few more moments trying to recall the missing information. When you decide that nothing can help you remember it, return to your notes and briefly look up what the missing part consisted of. When you finish memorizing a chunk of your speech, read through it again to verify that you have it correct.  Once you finish recalling the first chunk successfully, add the second chunk to it, repeating both until the second chunk can be recited from memory, as well. Continue on in this manner until the entire speech or speech section can be recalled without the use of notes.   It is important that you continue repeating previously memorize chunks so that you do not forget them. Moreover, repeating all chunks of your speech together will help you to memorize how each chunk fits together with the rest.  Continue practicing your speech out loud. If you have trouble remembering a certain chunk, isolate it and focus on recalling it from memory before trying to weave it back into the speech as a whole.  While writing and speaking your speech are the two most important practices involved in memorizing the speech, recording the speech and playing it back for yourself can also help.   Use this recording to listen to your speech when you do not have the chance to practice it out loud. You can play it for yourself in the car or play it as you fall asleep, for example.  Mental images are often the strongest sense to rely on for memory, but these other senses can still help significantly.   For instance, if you say that a certain historical event really made a bang or made a splash, you can imagine the sound of a loud bang or the sound and feeling of something heavy dropping into water.  If you have a list that you need to recall verbatim, you can use a mnemonic device known as an acronym to recall the items on that list. An acronym uses the first letter of each item in the list to create a sentence or word, which can then be used to recall those first letters.   For example, you can use the acronym HOMES to recall the names of the Great Lakes in the U.S.: Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, Superior  , Consider weaving analogies and stories into your speech to illustrate various concepts and ideas. A concrete example can make information easier to recall, and concrete examples can also engage the audience better.   For example, if you deliver a speech about various mental disorders and you know someone in your family or from your past who suffers from a disorder covered in your speech, you can tell a story about that person that illustrates what it is like to suffer from that disorder.  By incorporating physical actions into your speech delivery, you can help yourself memorize important parts of your speech while also engaging your audience more effectively.   If speaking about a political issue in the United States, you could raise your left hand when talking about what the political left believes and your right hand when talking about what the political right believes.

 The Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA), is a law that was passed by the U.S. Congress to deal with asbestos in school buildings. If you study this law, you will find definitions of various forms of asbestos. The law also includes requirements regarding inspections at school buildings. The Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act can be found at 15 U.S.C. §§2641-2656.To locate and study statutes, you can either search the citation online or visit a law library. Reference librarians in law libraries can help you find exactly what you need when you have the citation reference. To search the law online, you can either search by the title, or by the citation number. Simply entering “15 USC 2641” into the search bar will get you to the full chapter of the federal legislation.  The Asbestos Information Act, passed by Congress in 1988, provided transparency for the public regarding manufacturers who make products that use asbestos. The law includes requirements for recording and maintaining records about products using asbestos or asbestos-containing material.The Asbestos Information Act is also referred to as The Asbestos Information Act of 1988. It can be searched by that title or by its citation at 15 U.S.C. §2607.  The Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Reauthorization Act, abbreviated ASHARA, was passed by Congress to further protect schools from the dangers of asbestos. This law contains four main objectives:to assist schools in carrying out their responsibilities under AHERA to provide scientific and technical assistance to state agencies that deal with asbestos to provide funding to state and local agencies for training regarding asbestos protection to protect school employees against any repercussions for pointing out asbestos concerns in schools.  The Clean Air Act (CAA) was passed by Congress in 1977 to protect against all forms of air pollution, including the release of asbestos into the air. The CAA, in Section 7412, specifically names asbestos as one of many chemical air pollutants that are covered.You can find more detail of the CAA by searching its name or statute citation at 42 U.S.C. §§7401-7671.  The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) was passed by Congress in 1974 and then reauthorized in 1996.This law sets standards for safe drinking water and requires the EPA to produce regular reports about contaminants, including asbestos, in the nation’s drinking water.  When someone talks about “the law,” that phrase can apply to several different sources. Federal law comes from statutes passed by Congress and signed into law by the President.State law comes from statutes that are passed by a state’s legislature and signed by that state’s governor. Federal laws control an issue nationwide, while state laws only apply to the state that issued them. Much of asbestos law comes from federal statutes, because consumer and worker safety is legislated nationally.  

review the asbestos hazard emergency response act.  read the asbestos information act.  search the asbestos school hazard abatement reauthorization act.  research the federal clean air act.  look up the federal safe drinking water act.  understand the role of federal statutes. 

 You cannot adopt a child if the Social Worker has previously removed someone from the household, or if you've reached the max household size of 8 Sims.Assuming neither of those has happened, any Sim at the young adult stage or older can adopt.  Interact with any phone and select the "Call Services" option, then select "Adoption Services."   The Sim must be on his or her home lot to adopt.  When adopting, you get to choose between a girl and a boy, and between a baby, toddler, or child. You also get to name the kid, although the last name will always be the same as the Sim who made the phone call.The traits and appearance are always random, but you can improve future traits with a good upbringing.  Within a game hour the kid should arrive at your house. Babies and toddlers are dropped off by a social worker, while children will ride a bike to your house.  

start with a stable household.  phone the adoption services.  choose a child.  wait for the kid. 

 You can try to resolve the dispute by sending a letter to the violator and warning them to stop the violation. Someone can violate your intellectual property (IP) rights in a variety of ways. You should gather information about the violation before sitting down to draft your cease and desist letter.   For example, someone might be counterfeiting goods and using your trademark on them. Try to get samples of the counterfeit goods. Alternately, someone could be selling bootleg copies of your music or literary creation. Get copies or print off the website pages where the copies are being sold. Someone also might have taken your patent and used the specifications included in your patent application to manufacture the product. If so, get samples of the product.; , You should format the letter like a regular business letter. Set the font to a readable size and style. Times New Roman 12-point works for most people.   Always remember to include the date on your letter.If you end up in court, you want to establish when the defendant had notice of the infringement.  You can write, “I am writing on behalf of AmeriStyle Corporations, located in Raleigh, North Carolina. AmeriStyle provides specialty clothing for men and women as well as children.”  , Explain to the recipient that you have the IP rights.You should specifically mention if you have registered the intellectual property and where. Also include registration numbers.   For example, you could write, “I currently hold the trademark to the ‘AmeriStyle’ name as well as to our logos, copies of which I have attached. We have registered the trademarks in your country on August 31, 2008. Our registration numbers are…”  , Tell the violator in as much detail as possible how he or she has violated your IP rights.Be sure to explain how you became aware of the violation.   For example, you could write, “Recently, I became aware of your use of the ‘AmeriStyle’ trademark. I received complaints from consumers in your country that they had bought goods which were substandard. However, we do not sell our goods in your country. When we reached out to the consumers, they forwarded samples of the goods. These goods are counterfeit and use our trademark in an unauthorized manner.”  , Be clear, although you should avoid being rude. Make sure that you include a threat to bring a lawsuit if the person doesn’t stop using your intellectual property.   For example, you could write, “I request that you cease all continuing or future use of my trademarks. If you do not immediately cease, then I will instruct my lawyer to take appropriate legal action to protect my intellectual property rights. Any continued infringement from the date of receiving this letter will be considered willful.”, You will probably have to mail the letter to a foreign country. Try to use a mail service that provides for tracking or for a signed receipt. You will want some kind of evidence that the letter was actually delivered.   If you have the email address for the violator, then send the cease and desist letter as an email as well.  

identify the violation of your intellectual property rights.  format the cease and desist letter.  identify yourself in the first paragraph.  identify your intellectual property rights.  explain how the recipient is violating your ip rights.  include a request to cease all violations.  deliver the cease and desist letter. 

, Chemicals are usually applied from the center of the pond outward, doing small sections at a time. Spraying an entire pond at once can cause too many plants to decompose and may rob the aquatic life living beneath the surface of valuable oxygen. To avoid this, apply the treatment to the most overgrown areas of the pond first before tackling other small sections after a few weeks pass.  Applying an herbicide directly to the lily pad may work, but oftentimes, you will need to apply a surfactant beforehand to dissolve the protective wax coating on the outer surface of the pad. Spray the surfactant onto the top of the pad liberally.  Glyphosate-based herbicides are the most commonly used for lily pad removal, but imazapyr-based herbicides will also work.Both are broad spectrum, non-selective herbicides that essentially kill any surface plant they come into contact with, but neither kills plants hat live under the surface of the water.  Follow the instructions on the herbicide's label to determine an appropriate dosage. Usually, aquatic herbicides are sprayed directly over the top of the lily pad until the surface is thoroughly and evenly coated.  The herbicide will kill the plant, leaving dead plant matter floating on the surface. Wade or row into the water and rake away dead lily pads. Pull up the roots, if possible. While the herbicide should have killed the roots, it will not be good for your pond if too many dead roots linger at the bottom and are allowed to decompose.  Wait two to three weeks in between applications, spraying one small section at a time to prevent the ecosystem of the pond from becoming unbalanced. After the entire pond has been covered, go back over areas that were already treated if too many of the lily pads survived the initial application.  

use chemicals after the primary flowering period has ended.chemical treatment is most effective and least likely to cause permanent damage to your pond's ecosystem when the season's first batch of lily blooms have died off.  ,  figure out where to apply treatment.  apply an agricultural surfactant.  choose the right type of herbicide.  apply the herbicide to the top of the pads.  rake away the dead lily pads.  repeat this process over several weeks. 

 Some states have reciprocity agreements with other, neighboring states, that waive registration requirements so long as certain criteria are met. If you are traveling in a small number of states, check with those states to get an idea of what agreements are in place. For example, Oregon has an agreement with Washington and Idaho agreeing to waive registration fees so long as the Oregon vehicle is operating within 50 miles of the Oregon border., If you do not travel to other states states often, you may not have an IFTA license. If you do not have an IFTA license but you need to travel to other states, you might be able to get a temporary fuel tax trip permits. These temporary permits can be obtained at various on-site locations. For example, in California, you can obtain temporary permits at specific truck stops. In Nevada, you have to call the Nevada Motor Carrier Division in order to obtain the correct permits. In Idaho, you can get a permit at various truck stops and ports of entry., If your state does not have reciprocity with the state you are traveling to, you will need to comply with that state's requirements. Call the motor carrier division of every state you are traveling to to get more information. If you are going to travel to these states often, you may have to comply with federal interstate permitting and licensing requirements.  

check for reciprocity agreements.  obtain fuel tax trip permits.  meet every other state's registration requirements. 

 You'll want your VIN, engine code, and production date. You might not need all this information, but it will save time.; ,  , Say the following, exactly, "Hello, this is . I'm looking for a used engine for my "  , Then ask for a free Vehicle History Report (an Auto Check or CARFAX) to verify the mileage.  Does it include the intake and exhaust manifolds? Fuel rails? Wiring harness? Oil Pan? Valve Covers? Timing Covers? Is there any damage to any of these systems? Was the vehicle in a front or rear impact?  , Most of the parts listed above are left on the used engine for convenience and none will be guaranteed to fit or be covered under the warranty. Manufacturers use the same block and heads for many years, but the attached parts may differ from year to year. Plan on transferring the correct parts from your old engine, and proof of replacing the timing components (especially on belt drive engines and DOHC engines) is required for most warranties to be valid. , Believe it or not, wrecked cars purchased at insurance auctions are very expensive.  

gather information about your vehicle.  open up your local yellow pages book and search under "auto parts - used and rebuilt" or go to bing.com and search for "used engines.",  go through the list of suppliers.  ask for the mileage on the engine.  ask for a description of the engine.  keep in mind when buying a used engine, you are buying the engine (block,heads and internal components)only.  ask if there is a cash discount.  ,  don't insult the auto recycler by asking if there's a cash discount. 

 you will often come across daggers. Normally they don't sell for much; however, once you learn enchantments, (they don't even necessarily have to be super strong), you can enchant the daggers and they sell for 300+ gold. Just be sure to max the damage, and not the amount of times they can be used., Save them up., These are needed in order to enchant the daggers (or any other item, really). If you happen to have a way to trap souls, then you can just stock up on empty soul gems. Or, you may prefer to just come across them, some empty, some not. Save these too, until you're ready to enchant the daggers., Enchant the daggers, and any shop or person who buys weapons will be glad to take them off your hands (so long as they have the proper gold, of course). 

notice that all around skyrim, while doing quests, battling, etc.  load up on daggers, store them at home (if you have one).  get soul gems.  spell it up. 

 This is the very first step. At this early stage, don't be too concerned about the story. Your goal here is to generate as many fresh ideas as you can. Don't worry too much about the quality of the ideas. An idea that appears good now may turn out to be a really bad idea later on. Write your ideas down so that you can go back and pick one to write on later.; , For content to be interesting, you need to pick a topic that is fresh. Everyone likes novelty. It's easier to create interesting content when you are writing about a cool mobile gadget that is about to be launched in the near future. You can, of course, with good writing skills, turn a mundane topic into something interesting. But that requires more effort and skill. Imagine having to write about doing the dishes. How interesting do you think your article will be?  , Too many writers try to impress their readers. As a result, they use flowery words or jargon that very few people can understand. Having a wide vocabulary is great. But misusing that range is never a good idea. Always strive to communicate your ideas clearly. This applies to all forms of writing - press releases, blogs, and even novels.  If you want your writing to come to life, be as descriptive as you can. Being descriptive is especially useful for fiction writers. Having all those little details simply allow the reader to paint a more vivid image in his or her mind.  Be clear about your target audience. Who are you writing for? If your writing is meant for the general public, then make it easy for everyone to understand. Use short sentences and simple words. If you are promoting your corporate website using a press release, write in a formal style.  Nobody likes to read stale content. If you are having difficulty having original ideas, start by stating your own opinions.  There are often opportunities for a writer to let the reader get a sense of who you are. Let your writing reflect your personality.  If you are making an argument in your article, try to back up your argument with facts and figures. Concrete statistics can help bring credibility to your writing.  If you are borrowing content or ideas from an external source, be sure to cite all sources at the end of the article. It's about respecting the rights of other writers. Being respectful makes the Internet a much nicer space for everyone.  

generate fresh ideas.  pick a fresh idea to write about.  write to communicate, not to impress.  be descriptive.  pick the right tone and writing style.  be creative and original.  let your personality shine.  don't forget the facts and figures.  quote and cite reference sources.

This can go from stacking up sugar cubes or other sweets and eating the wrapper along with the rice cake (maybe L didn't want to get his hand dirty?). Be able to knot a cherry stem with your tongue. Another fun thing you could do would be to make origami with the wrappers of your sweets (although this was not something that L is seen doing).

 You can think of a significant digit as an "interesting" or an "important" digit that gives you useful information about a number. This means that any zeroes to the right of whole numbers or to the left of decimals can be discounted because they are placeholders. To find the number of significant digits in a number, just count the number of digits from left to right. Here are some examples:1.239 has 4 significant digits 134.9 has 4 significant digits .0165 has 3 significant digits  , This depends on the problem you're working with. If you're rounding a number to two significant digits, for example, then you'll need to identify the second significant digit of the number and then use the number to the right of it to see if you should round it down or up. Here are some examples:1.239 rounded to 3 significant digits is 1.24. This is because the digit to the right of the third digit, 3, is a 9, which is 5 or more. 134.9 rounded to 1 significant digit is 100. This is because the digit to the right of the digit in the hundreds place, or the first digit, 1, is 3, which is less than 5. 0.0165 rounded to 2 significant digits is 0.017. This is because the second significant digit is 6, and the number to the right of it, 5, makes it round up.  To do this, you will first have to add up the numbers you are given. Then, you will have to find the number with the lowest amount of significant digits and then round your entire answer to that place. Here's how you do it:13.214 + 234.6 + 7.0350 + 6.38 = 261.2290 See that the second number, 234.6, is only accurate to the tenths place, or four significant digits. Round the answer so that it is only accurate to the tenths place. 261.2290 becomes 261.2.  First, multiply all of the numbers that you are given. Then, check them to see which number is rounded to the least amount of significant digits. Finally, round your finally answer to match the level of accuracy of that number. Here's how you do it:16.235 × 0.217 × 5 = 17.614975 Notice that the 5 number only has one significant digit. This means that your final answer will only have one significant digit as well. 17.614975 rounded to one significant digit becomes 20.  

understand what a significant digit is.  round a number to an amount of significant digits.  round to the correct number of significant digits in addition.  round to the correct number of significant digits in multiplication. 

 Corydoras are not very large fish, and generally don’t need too much room. A 20-gallon tank should be plenty big enough for a small school of non-dwarf Corydoras (about 4 to 6 fish). Of course, if you consider adding more fish, whether Corydoras or something else, you’ll need a bigger tank.There is a traditional “rule of thumb” that suggests 1-gallon per inch of fish that you put in the tank. This can be a good starting point for thinking about tank capacity, but keep in mind this rule is more accurate when measuring the *volume* of a fish. A ten-inch long fish probably is about 50-150 inches in volume, requiring a much larger tank than 10 1-inch-long fish that total to about 8 inches in volume. It is always best to err on the side having more space for your fish.; , Corydoras are hardy and adaptable fish, but they prefer certain conditions. Make sure your water’s pH level is around 7.0, and the temperature range between 70 and 78 degrees. Keep levels of nitrates and ammonia low, as these chemicals can cause sickness., Corydoras are bottom feeders, and like to swim and explore near the bottom of the tank. To protect your fish, use smooth gravel or sand, with a depth of at least 2 inches. Sharp or dirty bases can damage their barbels (the whiskers near the mouth that help the fish look for food) so stick to the fine grains.You don’t want to use small stones, as Corydoras like to dig around, and they need something they can lift up and root through.  Corydoras are from areas with lots of vegetation and hiding spots, so it is important to have those in your tank. Bushy plants with lots of stems at the base are important, as well as bogwood or other decor that creates areas the Corydoras can hide from other fish., Corydoras are bottom-feeding catfish, so they will eat pellets and flakes that sink to the bottom of the tank. Make sure you watch your fish eat, and avoid overfeeding by not giving them more food than they can eat in five minutes. If there is extra food in the tank, remove it to keep your tank clean.Corydoras are omnivores, meaning they eat both plant and animal matter. For an occasional treat, you can include frozen and live foods that sink to the bottom to complement a more regular diet of flakes and pellets. Though they may scavenge on the bottom of your tank, that food will not be enough, so make sure you supplement it with a variety of supplements to give your fish the right nutrition. Because Corydoras are nocturnal fish, the best time to feed them will probably be in the evening, before you turn out the lights for the night.  Corydoras are social fish, and generally prefer to swim in schools. For Corydoras, a school is a group of five or more. There are over a hundred different species, and while they will tend to school together if possible, Corydoras are generally sociable with other Corydoras. If you have one, it would probably enjoy some company.Depending on the pet store, species may or may not be sold together. Talk to the pet store about making sure you are getting the same species, and use your own eyes to compare size and color to find fish that appear to be the same.  Corydoras are unaggressive, non-territorial fish, making them perfect tank mates for a variety of other fish. One thing to consider would be to include surface and mid-level fish, which will help balance out your tank, and give people lots to look at.Good partners for your Corydoras include fish like the Otocinclus Catfish, Tetras, Swordtails, Guppies, Dwarf Cichlids, and other similar-sized fish. Filter-feeding shrimp and snails also make good company. Some of these smaller fish see Corydoras as “dither fish” (a sign that there are no predators ). This will reduce fear, and help to make their transition to a new tank easier. Bad partners for your Corydoras include cichlids, roughens, aquarium crayfish, and fish that are larger than your Corydoras. These can injure, or even eat, your Corydoras.  If you decide to breed your Corydoras to make more, you of course need to know that you have both males and females. The differences are easy to notice, and you can check them by looking at your fish from above. Females will be a little larger, with a rounder and broader body, while males tend to have slightly larger pectoral fins.If you intend to breed your Corydoras, you should try to get a ratio of two or three males for each female.  If your fish are ready to spawn, you will notice the males chasing the females and mating in the T position. Once they have mated, the female will lay her eggs against the aquarium glass, or among the leaves of the plants in your tank.In the wild, Corydoras usually spawn during the rainy season, so you can encourage mating by simulating these conditions. If you begin to notice your Corydoras engaging in spawning behavior, perform a water change with slightly cooler water.  Once you notice eggs in the tank, you should separate them from the parents. Corydoras will eat their own and each other’s eggs, so if you want new Corydoras, you should make sure the eggs and parents are in different tanks.One way to do this is to move the Corydoras to a separate breeding tank when you start to notice them spawning. Once the females lay eggs in the tank, you can move the fish back into their regular tank, and let the eggs hatch in peace. You can also remove eggs to their own hatching and raising tank after they have been laid. Keep the water conditions as similar as possible. If the eggs were laid in the plants, you can simply transfer the plants. If you’d prefer not to remove the whole plant, it is fine to cut off the parts where the eggs are and just move that. If the eggs are on the side of the tank, remove them by rolling your finger over them. Eggs are tough, so you shouldn’t do any damage removing them this way.  The eggs should hatch in three to five days. Once that happens, the new hatchlings, called “fry,” will be able to survive on their yolk sac until they start swimming freely. Once that happens, provide some brine shrimp nauplii (a type of larva) or decomposing plant material for them to eat. After about a week, you can start including microworms into their diet. 

get good-sized tank.  create the right water conditions.  give the tank a smooth base.  put a lot of plants into the tank.  feed your corydoras once a day.  get a school.  add other fish to your tank.  check the sex of your fish.  watch for your fish to spawn.  separate the eggs from the parents.  feed the new fish. 

 You need to approach couples therapy with an open mind and honesty. Your couples counseling sessions will begin with your counselor asking a series of questions to figure out where your relationship is. Your counselor will ask about your history as a couple, why you sought treatment, and other questions to see where you are as a couple.Make sure you get everything out on the table about your relationship. Express any grievances or issues that you've had with your partner so you can figure out which problems you need to address.; , Since you and your partner have opted to go to couples therapy, you may know some of the problems that you have as a couple and these will come out pretty easily. However, there may also be other problems you are not even aware of. Work with your counselor to figure out every problem that you and your partner have.This will help you get at any underlying issues that have led to your problems as well.  While working through your problems, your counselor will help you work out how to better communicate with each other so you can get past these problems and move ahead in your relationship. Your counselor will coach you in how to change the way you speak to each other in more productive and supportive ways.Your counselor will also help you and your partner figure out which ways are the best for you two to communicate. For example, if you and your partner have avoided conflict with each other in the past, your counselor will help you communicate honestly about your issues without keeping things bottled up. If you and your partner have resorted to constant criticism of each other, your counselor will help you learn to communicate your feelings with positive, supportive language.  When you first go to counseling, it may take some time for you and your partner to start talking to each other. Your counselor will help you figure out how to start talking about your problems in a productive way instead of suffering in silence. These silences may be filled with anger or sadness, depending on what problems you are trying to deal with.These times can be used to listen to your partner or for your to start talking honestly with your partner about how you are feeling.  Once you and your partner start working through your problems, old feelings are likely to come up. You will likely get angry, upset, or hurt when these problems come out. Expect to yell and fight with your partner. Your counselor will be there to be the mediator and help you figure out how to move past these fights and hurt feelings.This can be a cathartic experience because you are able to get all the pent up feelings out in the open so you can move past them.  

be honest with yourself and your partner.  figure out what your main problems are.  improve your communication.  don't be afraid of silence.  expect to yell or fight.

 While most patients who have had diabetes for some time are able to tell when their blood sugar levels are low, it is still important to recognize the symptoms of diabetes-related hypoglycemia so that you can prevent severe episodes, including loss of consciousness and other fatal complications. Some common symptoms are indicated below:Dizziness: This occurs because there is reduced sugar level in the brain cells. The brain needs nutrients for proper functioning capability. When there is reduced blood sugar level, you will be feel dizzy. Trembling: This is caused by reduced energy levels in the body due to reduced blood sugar. The sugar that is present in the blood is taken up by the cells used for the production of energy. Hunger: This is also caused by reduced amounts of energy. When you go into a diabetes-related hypoglycemic state, all the food that was present in your body has been broken down into sugar. This leaves you with no food in the abdomen and high hunger levels. Increased heart rate: This is caused by reduced nutrients in the cells, which causes your heart to work harder while trying to meet the demands of the body. Confusion: This occurs due to reduced nutrients to the brain cells, which leads to impaired brain functionality. Headache: Headache is also caused by impaired brain functionality. Poor coordination: This is caused by reduced energy levels in the body. Poor concentration: This is caused by impaired brain functionality. Fainting: This is caused by impaired brain functionality and reduced energy levels in the body. Coma: This occurs in severe cases when there is a prolonged period of low blood sugar.  Diabetics who understand the risk factors for hypoglycemia can learn to prevent cases of hypoglycemia.   Hypoglycemia is common in diabetic patients who inject an excess dosage of insulin. Insulin lowers the blood sugar level but when high doses are used, the levels will spike, thus causing hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is common in diabetic patients who miss meals. Diabetics are advised to eat all their meals to ensure that their sugar levels remain normal. The food eaten is broken down into sugar that is used by the body for the production of energy. When a meal is missed, the body will have insufficient levels of sugar. Hypoglycemia is common in diabetic patients who take part in excessive exercise. Foods are broken down into sugar, which is then taken by the cells for the production of energy. During exercise, a lot of energy is consumed, which can leave you with decreased sugar levels.  Knowing that diabetes-related hypoglycemia is life threatening, it is important to be knowledgeable on how to prevent these episodes. Here are some simple lifestyle practices to keep in mind:   Munch on complex carbohydrates for snacks. This will help you maintain and stabilize the blood sugar levels in your body. Bring both simple and complex carbohydrate snacks with you at all times. Eat at regular times throughout the day. When physically active, it is important to replace the carbohydrates and glucose used up by your body. Have an emergency kit with you containing glucagon at all times.  

recognize the symptoms.  understand the risk factors.  prevent diabetes-related hypoglycemic episodes. 

 Pour one cup of water into your pressure cooker, or whatever is the minimum quantity required for your cooker to maintain pressure. Then place a steaming basket or other cooking rack into the bottom of the cooker.   You may only need a trivet and not a steaming basket or other cooking rack to support the bowl or pot you will place inside the cooker.  Locate a heat-proof bowl or pot that will fit inside your pressure cooker. Put your desired amount of rice into the bowl, and the correct amount of water for the quantity and type of rice (one cup of white rice, for instance, needs 1.5 cups of water).Choose a stainless steel bowl for ideal cooking, as it will conduct heat better than glass or ceramics. Substitute all or part of the water with a liquid for flavoring if you wish, such as chicken broth, vegetable broth, or prepared bouillion. Add a teaspoon of butter, olive oil, or an oil of your choice to the rice for flavor if you like.  Lower the bowl with your rice and liquid into the pressure cooker so it sits on your steaming basket or trivet. Don’t cover your bowl with anything. Then close and lock the lid of your cooker.   Check the instruction manual for your pressure cooker to ensure that you are closing and locking the lid properly.  Set the burner on your stove to high heat until your pressure cooker indicates high pressure, then lower the heat to maintain this pressure for three minutes. Check your specific instruction manual for how to properly read the pressure on your cooker.   If you are using an electric pressure cooker, set it to high pressure for three minutes. The cooker will take a few minutes to pressure up before the three minutes of cooking time., When the three minutes cooking time is up, take the pressure cooker off the burner for a 10-minute natural pressure release, meaning the pressure built up inside releases naturally when taken off of heat. The rice will continue to cook while the pressure is slowly released.   For an electric cooker, turn it off when the timer beeps and set it to a natural pressure release for 10 minutes.Lower the heat right away after your cooker reaches high pressure, otherwise your rice can become quickly overcooked., After 10 minutes of natural release, do a quick release on your pressure cooker to open the lid. Tilt the cooker away from you when opening the lid to avoid the hot steam.Carefully remove your bowl or pot and fluff the rice with a fork before serving.  

pour water into your pressure cooker.  put rice and water into a heat-proof bowl.  place the bowl into the pressure cooker.  bring your pressure up.  release the pressure.  open lid and remove the bowl. 

 You will need to toggle the WLAN switch on your PSP in order to enable Wi-Fi connections.   On the PSP-1000 and PSPgo, the switch is on the left side, next to the analog nub. Slide the switch up. On the PSP-2000 and 3000, the WLAN switch is on the top of the PSP, to the left of the UMD drive. Slide the switch right.; , You must have at least version 2.0 of the PSP's operating system in order to connect to the Internet.   The most current PSP operating system is 6.61., It's the suitcase icon on the far-left side of the main menu.  This option is at the bottom of the Settings column of options.  This allows your PSP to connect to a wireless access point, such as your home network's router.  This will allow you to create a new connection to be saved on your PSP.   If you already have a working connection saved, select it and press X. Doing so should connect you to the Internet. You can save up to ten different connections.  Your PSP will look for any available wireless networks.   If your PSP can't find any networks, move closer to your router. You can also select "Wireless Hotspot" if you have the PSP plan with T-Mobile, which is the only way to connect to a mobile hotspot.  After scanning, a list of available networks will be displayed; select the one that you want to connect to.   The signal strength for each network will be listed next to the network name. Opt for a signal strength of more than 50%.  This will select your current network's name.   Changing the name here may cause issues with your Internet connection on other devices.  This will set your network's security type as WPA, which is supported by the PSP., Press X on the "WPA Key" screen, enter your network's password and press X, and then press the "Right" arrow.   Wireless passwords are case-sensitive, so make sure to enter the password exactly.  Doing so lets the PSP use the router's default settings.  This will confirm your network's name.  You will be shown a list of all of your settings. Make sure everything looks correct, then press the "Right" button on the directional pad to continue and press X to save your settings.  This will test your PSP's connection to the Internet. If you see "Successful" on the Results page, then your connection was properly configured., This will be used to access the configuration page:   Windows - Open Start, click the Settings gear, click Network & Internet, click View your network properties, and view the address next to "Default gateway".  Mac - Open the Apple menu, click System Preferences, click Network, click Advanced, click the TCP/IP tab, and look for the number to the right of "Router:".  Do so on your computer.  This will open your router's page, which allows you to make changes to your router settings.  You will need to enter your username and password to be able to access your router's settings.   If you cannot figure out the login information, you can manually reset the router by pressing and holding the "Reset" button on the back for at least 30 seconds.  The exact wording here will vary on different routers.  Select either WPA-PSK + WPA2-PSK or WPA2 Personal TKIP+AES.   If you choose "WPA2 " only, you will not be able to connect.  You may first have to open the Advanced Wireless Settings. Again, the wording may vary.  If it is turned on and you can't disable it, add your PSP's MAC address to the list of allowed devices. You can find your PSP's MAC address in the "System Information" section of the PSP's Settings menu.  If you still can't get the connection to work, you'll have to take the PSP into a tech department for further evaluation. 

ensure the wlan switch is on.  update your psp.  scroll left to select settings.  scroll down to select network settings and press x.  select infrastructure mode and press x.  select and press x.  select scan and press x.  select your network and press x.  press the "right" arrow on the "ssid" screen.  select the wpa-psk (aes) option and press the "right" arrow.  enter the password.  select easy and press the "right" arrow.  press the "right" arrow.  save your settings.  select test connection and press x.  find your router's ip address.  open a web browser.  enter your router's ip address into the address bar.  log in with your administrator account if prompted.  open the wireless section.  change your security type.  find the "allowed devices" or "access list".  ensure that mac address filtering is not turned on.  try connecting your psp to the internet. 

; , You should see several things going on. It'll open to a page where you'll be able to scan all of the QR codes and barcodes that exist on most products and all store shelves.  Make sure the scanner has sufficient light and all of the barcode is in sight of the lens. The app will readjust the light to focus in on the code, if it recognizes the overall design as being that of an accepted code.   Realize that while a Microsoft Tag code looks similar to a QR code in style, ScanLife can't read it. Microsoft Tags can only be read on the Microsoft Tag app.  If you scan a QR code, you'll be asked whether or not you'd like to visit the webpage the code is asking the user to view. If it's a barcode, you'll be taken directly to the NexTag site for the product with the barcode you've scanned.  This is where you'll see all of your other recent code-scans.  Although this will rarely change when viewed minute-by-minute, it will change in a day-by-day form (unless you've got very active friends who use ScanLife a lot). 

download, install and open the scanlife app on your iphone.  look at the main page of the app, after the splash screen displays and goes away.  scan a barcode or qr code from the location.  recognize the types of results you may obtain.  look for the history icon on the bottom taskbar of the app.  look for popular scans from others worldwide in the "discover" app.  look for messages from stores near you who have sent you a message in the app on the inbox tab.  

 Head to the main valve and turn the water supply off at the source. This will prevent more water from entering the system so that all you need to do is drain the water already inside.   The shut off valve for your sprinkler system should be located in an area that will not be able to freeze over. Oftentimes, the valve will be located inside, in a basement, garage, or utility closet. In some cases, a stop and waste valve will be located underground. It can be as deep as 5 feet (1.5 m) down, so you may need a long key to turn it.  These valves should be located at the end points and low points of your sprinkler system's piping. After opening the valves, the water in the mainline of the system should drain out on its own.  After the mainline finishes draining, open either the boiler drain valve or the drain cap on the stop and waste valve. Open all the test cocks on the backflow device, as well.   Your system will either have a boiler drain valve or a drain cap on a stop and waste valve. It will not have both. The option it does have will vary depending on which option is used in your area, so you can check with neighbors or a local professional to find out which you can expect to find.  If the sprinklers in your system have check valves, you will need to pull up on the sprinklers so that the water can drain out of the bottom of the sprinkler head.   Most sprinklers will have check valves. If yours does not, however, you will need to hope that the water can completely drain out of the other valves along the system instead.  If the location of your drain valves are not positioned well, there could be some water remaining in the backflow, piping, or sprinklers even after you complete this method.   If you want to get at any remaining, trace amounts of water, you could try to suck the water out with a wet/dry shop vac.  It may take several minutes for the water to completely drain out of the backflow, piping, and sprinklers. Once the water finishes draining, you should close all the drain valves you opened previously.  

shut off the water supply.  open the manual drain valves.  drain the remaining water between the shut off valve and backflow device.  pull up on the sprinklers.  watch out for excess water.  close the manual drain valves after draining the water. 

 A lot of food in your child's plate may overwhelm them, which could lead to food throwing. Instead of piling food on your child's bowl or plate, regulate the amount of food you are serving out each time, and add more once they clear their plate., If the child is not listening to you and continually throws food or drops their plate on the floor, end the meal. Once the toddler understands the consequences of their actions, they may stop throwing food.If you are worried that your toddler didn't get enough to eat, you can give them a healthy snack later.  When your child starts to throw food, it's important to make them aware of the rules even if they don't fully understand what you are saying. Tell your child not to do it and ask them if they are still hungry before ending the meal.Say things like "Are you done?" or "Not hungry anymore?" when your child starts throwing food.  Give your toddler positive feedback when there is a successful meal that's free of food-throwing. Don't give too much attention or negative reinforcement when they throw food, or else they could perceive the attention as a reward.You can say "Great job Henry! You had a great meal and you didn't throw any of your food." Affordable rewards like stickers or fruit snacks are also great tangible rewards for your toddler.  

limit the amount of food that you put on their plate.  end the meal if the food throwing gets out of hand.  set rules and limits on your toddler.  reward positive behavior. 

 These traps are basically wooden boxes with a door in the front for the rabbit to enter. Live traps can be used to humanely capture and then release rabbits.You will need a trigger in the middle of the trap to close the door once the rabbit nudges it. The trigger is usually a wooden peg with a wire or string that you attach to the front door. Wooden traps, even when made with plywood, can be somewhat heavy to move, though. Place the bait to the back of the box as a lure to coax the rabbit into the trap. The rabbit should bump the trigger as it tries to reach the bait. Wooden traps are easy to build if you test the trigger a few times. They also are not very expensive.  These traps are made of heavy wire mesh or gauge wire, and they might have a steel frame. You can find them at some pet or hardware stores or online.   Such traps usually have a single entry, where they are open at one end, or even a double entry, where both ends open, and they collapse for easier storage or moving. They work the same way as wooden traps. The rabbit is enticed into the trap with bait, and a trigger causes the door to close. These traps are lighter in weight and more open. The animal doesn’t realize it’s being confined as much as it would with a wooden trap, so mesh traps can be more effective. Rabbit traps are usually 24"x7"x7" and 24"x8"x8". You don’t want to make it too big or you could catch other animals.  Remember that rabbits usually live in areas with good cover. This means you will find them in brush piles, in fence rows, and in briar patches.   Rabbits also like low-cut bluegrass. You should place the rabbit trap along trails that rabbits have already made in these areas. Rabbits are likely to use the same trails as they have in the past. Put the trap right in the pathway. You could also put the trap in front of a hole in the ground or in front of a brush pile, if you know that these are being used as rabbit dens. You could also place a trap in an area where you see rabbit droppings.  In a trap with a single door, put the bait at the end. In a trap with two doors, put the bait in the center of the trap.   You want to position the bait, so you lure most of the rabbit’s body into the trap. This should set off the door trigger by engaging the metal plate in the trap. Wear gloves when you bait your trap so that you don’t leave a trace of human scent in the trap. This will stop rabbits from coming into it.

 Place it in a large mixing bowl with 2 cups (473 ml) of water. Set it aside while you move on to the next steps. Let it soak for 30 minutes to rehydrate., First, wash your rice. Then slice your carrots into thin inch-long strips (2.5 cm). Next, boil some water, place the aburaage in a large fine sieve, and pour the water over it to wash off the manufacturer’s oil.

Pour this into the cooker once mixed., First, drain your hijiki with a large fine sieve and wash it under running water. Then place it on top of the rice. Then pile your carrots and aburaage on top of that.Do not mix the other ingredients into the rice, since this will cause the rice to cook unevenly.  Expect cooking times to vary between cookers. Refer to the instructions for your particular make and model., Once the rice has finished cooking, use a shamoji (an Asian style of spoon) or similarly thin, flat utensil to mix the carrots, hijiki, and aburaage into the rice. As you do, make quick slicing motions to flip and combine them. Avoid jamming your spoon into the rice the way you would with, say, mashed potatoes, to avoid mashing the rice.

 Interactive toys, such as wand toys, can be used to help determine your cat’s prey drive and play style. For example, you can move the toy along the ground or through the air mimicking different types of prey. Other types of interactive toys include balls and stuffed animals that can be thrown and then chased by your cat., Cats typically hunt small prey, such as mice, insects, bunnies, and small birds. As a result, the toys they play with should reflect the size of their natural prey.For example, a large toy may be too intimidating and could be seen as a predator rather than prey.  If your cat ever gives you a toy this likely indicates that they like this toy and want to play. For example, a cat may drop a ball in your lap to signal that they want you to throw the ball. Keep track of the toys that your cat gives to you. These likely reflect your cat's preferred style of play.  

purchase interactive toys.  buy small toys.  notice when your cat gives you a toy. 

 Recognizing the symptoms of anxiety is the first step to managing your anxiety and help your doctor determine if you may have some form of an anxiety disorder. There are groups of people that are specifically more prone to issues with anxiety, such as women, individuals who experience traumatic events, individuals who experience extreme stress or mental health disorders, or individuals with a history of alcohol and drug abuse. Common symptoms of anxiety include:Feeling nervous Feeling as if you are in danger or that something is always going to happen to you Experiencing an elevated heart rate Hyperventilation, sweating, and shaking Having feelings of weakness or tiredness without cause Inability to pay attention or think about anything other than current anxieties; , There are multiple kinds of disorders that deal with anxiety. Although most can manifest in similar ways, these disorders generally occur due to different events in your life. Generalized anxiety disorder includes persistent and unnecessary worries about everyday, common events or activities, which can disrupt concentration and lead to other issues, such as depression.   You may also suffer from agoraphobia, which is an intense and irrational fear of places or events, which cause you anxiety, embarrassment, or despair. Another common disorder is social anxiety disorder, which involves extreme levels of anxiety. These individuals also avoid social situations because to embarrassment, self-consciousness, and concern about being seen badly by others.  Selective mutism is another anxiety disorder, which is a constant and long-lasting failure to talk in certain situations, such as school, work, or social events, even when you speak normally in other situations. This disorder can disrupt school, work, and social functioning.  Panic disorder is also a common anxiety disorder which involves multiple episodes of extreme fear, anxiety, or dread. These events are called panic attacks. Feelings of impending doom, trouble breathing, heart palpitations, or pains in the chest are all symptoms of panic attacks.  Separation anxiety disorder is a common childhood disorder that occurs when a child is separated from their parents or guardians, characterized by unnecessary anxiety. If you are a drug user, you may be suffering from substance-induced anxiety disorder, which causes panic attacks and anxiety due to the drug use. This disorder can also be caused by medications, toxic substances, or drug and alcohol withdrawal. Certain phobias can cause major anxiety when exposed to a specific object or situation, and may provoke panic attacks in some people., Traumatic events, extreme change, heredity factors, or intense stress can cause anxiety disorders. Sometimes, anxiety can occur as a warning sign or side effect of an underlying medical issue. This is more likely if no one in your family has anxiety, if you never experienced anxiety as a child, or if you have a sudden onset of anxiety that seems to not be connected to your daily life.   Anxiety can also be a side effect of certain medications. If your doctor suspects your anxiety has a medical cause, they may suggest tests to look for signs of a problem. Common conditions linked with anxiety are heart disease, diabetes, thyroid problems, asthma, drug and alcohol abuse or withdrawal, irritable bowel syndrome, premenstrual syndrome, and, in rare cases, tumors., Anxiety may not fade or disappear on its own. It can also get worse over time if you don’t seek medical help. Anxiety is easier to treat if you get help when you first notice the signs. Get a medical examination to help you determine if your anxiety is temporary or if you have some sort of anxiety disorder.   Never take herbs, supplements, or medications for anxiety without your doctor’s approval, as some can cause side effects. You should see your healthcare provider or seek medical care immediately if you experience anxiety that is interfering with your work, relationships and daily activities. Also talk to you doctor if you experience panic attacks a lot, your anxiety is causing stress and fatigue, you feel depressed, have trouble with alcohol or drug use, or have other mental health concerns, or you think your anxiety may be the result of a physical health problem. Seek medical care immediately or call 911 if have suicidal thoughts or behaviours. 

recognize the symptoms of anxiety.  understand types of anxiety.  diagnose the cause.  visit your doctor. 

 Take time to relax your entire body and focus gently until the body becomes present to you.  You should spend your time relaxing any blockages and imagining all your energy channels are opening. When you feel ready, move to the next stage.  Essentially you are looking for general stillness in the body, but the whole body is, naturally, in a state of flux and movement. You are looking for the stillness within the movement.   A classical metaphor used in Taoism and Chan Buddhism is "still, flowing water". This ancient metaphor describes nicely what you are aiming for, it is a state of letting go that you become still, with the flow of time, energy and space happening without your interference, but with your complete acceptance and love. This comes into Taoist philosophy as a "returning to the source". Again like Buddhist philosophy (which is why Buddhist and Taoist meditations can and often are used side by side), all things come from the Tao, which is nothingness or voidness, and this emptiness contains the whole universe. Returning to the source of this energy will not only replenish and heal but lead towards enlightenment. This is because the mind is fundamentally void and clear, and it is simply manifestations we see, feel and interact with, and these come from the emptiness - the Tao. When you deeply understand this, you will not be troubled by thoughts or feelings as you know they are simply manifestations, but you can return to the source; that beautiful, peaceful emptiness and stillness and you know nothing can contaminate your mind. It's also used in the old Taoist riddles and Zen koans of the original mind or nature.  This is an advanced practice that may not immediately show itself to you until you are well developed in gentleness and kindness. Stay as long as you wish.  Thank the universe and allow your heart to be filled with a gentle gratitude while you rest for a minute with your eyes closed. Then gently move your body, rub your face and head to stimulate energy and open your eyes.   Use this practice to create serenity as by knowing that the source of everything and nothing is within you, then many of your troubles can seem much smaller - even irrelevant - than they were before.  

close your eyes.  spend time here.  find any part of your body that is still.  take your time and unify or centre the stillness.  complete the meditation.

 To help treat and even prevent further foot fungus, you need to take care of your shoes. Try to wear shoes that are made of breathable fabric. You can also try wearing 100% cotton socks. Other materials don’t allow your feet to breathe.   Also try buying more open toed shoes. This helps give your feet room to move around and give them access to open air., Avoid wearing the same shoes two days in a row. Your shoes need time to air out. Throw away worn out shoes that might be breeding grounds for bacteria and fungus. Also throw away or disinfect any shoes you wore without socks while you had foot fungus. You don't want to contract the fungus again.   You can also spray them with Lysol or other disinfectants to reduce the chance of fungus or bacteria growing in your shoes. If your shoes aren't breathable, try to take your shoes off as often as you can and expose your feet to the air., In order to help your fungus not get worse, keep your feet dry. When you get out of the shower, use a cotton towel to dry your feet carefully. This is especially true if you are in a locker room or public shower. If you have already showered but your feet get wet, wash them separately to ensure they stay clean and dry.   Don't forget about the areas between toes. Keeping these dry will help with athlete's foot. Avoid walking barefoot in public areas. Instead, wear flip-flops, sandals, or water shoes. Also make sure you change your socks every day. , Make sure you never go barefoot in these places — wear sandals, flip-flops, or shower shoes. 

buy the right footwear.  practice shoe maintenance.  keep your feet dry and clean.  wear sandals in public places.locker rooms, pools, showers, and other similar, moist areas are breeding grounds for fungus. 

 Pale pinks, baby greens, white, and cream are all basic colors. Then, there's mint greens and pale yellows and sometimes red or black. Basically, you want to look innocent-- like a little girl playing princess games or fairy games. Patterns are usually crowns, cupcakes, flowers, or butterflies. Once you have a couple of skirts/dresses in the color scheme, it's easy to accessorize. The skirt should maintain basic Loli rules-- bell or A-line shaped with a petticoat to hold it up. Frills and bows and mostly just above the knee. Sometimes hime skirts and dresses go below the knee.; , White is always almost the best color to go with any skirt. And you don't have to buy a white blouse at a real Loli store. You can get them almost anywhere and add your own little collar, etc.  Hair is one of the hardest parts, in many people's opinion. If you have short hair (Shoulder length or chin length) don't worry! You can still do hime hair, although it won't be as big as other dos, unless you use extensions. For people with shorter hair, try curling it and adding a little bow or tiara. Pigtails always look nice. An example of a cut has a fringe and long side-bangs. If you have long hair, curl part of your hair and tease the rest of it up into a beehive like hair style. This hair is practically the same as Himegyaru hair, and there are lots of tutorials on the net for that. Always add a tiara, bow, headband or cute clip.  A lot of people get stuck on the winter wear. A coat with a shape that fits nicely over the bell or A-line shaped skirt and a long-sleeved blouse is all you need. You can wear stockings instead of socks if you want, and find some boots and a hat that match your coat. Simple!  , The socks should be knee socks, but they can also be ankle socks. They can be lacy, have frills or bows attached or just a cute pattern such as cakes or striped. Make sure they match the rest of your outfit though. Shoes are like any other Loli style. Mary Janes with a heel, or flats, or even Rocking Horse Shoes. Sometimes you can get good deals at a normal shoe shop. Such as flats with a small bow decoration or heeled pastel colored boots. As long as they go with the outfit and seem girly and 'princess-y' it's good!  , Bows, tiaras, flowers and frills are all you need. Add a tiara, maybe get a necklace with a rose or bow on it. You can get lots of rings with little bows on them. Look on the net for ideas. Makeup is easy. You don't need much, just enough to make you look fresh and innocent. So rosy, rosy cheeks! Eyeliner to open up the eye. White eyeliner in the corner and waterline of your eye really makes them look big. Some people like false eyelashes and some just use a lot of mascara. Pink lip-gloss also works very well. Nail art is very popular in Hime. You can buy fake nails, or get your real nails done professionally.  Gold or silver Jewelry is perfect for this. Maybe a bracelet, a necklace or some cute gold earrings. Keep it limited, but not so much so it looks like no jewelry at all!  , Just be your self. As in everything you do, try to have good manners in front of rude people, remember you are a better person and don't need to go to their low levels to make them shut up. But most of all be yourself, there's no attitude code for ANY type of Lolita.  

work out your color scheme.  pick the right blouse.  consider your hair style.  adapt your look for winter.  choose shoes and socks, this is quite easy.  do your makeup and accessories next, then you'll be all set!,  wear jewelry.  have the attitude. 

 These personal statements often include specific references to a portion of your life, and are evaluated based on how well you answer the given question. You don’t want to waste precious space addressing a question they didn’t ask, so take the time to make sure you understand the prompt clearly.; , Each school has a specific statement of purpose that indicates what kind of institution it is, what skills the university values and promotes, and what they expect from their students. Peruse your school’s website and read all of this information so that you can reference it in your letter.Usually, you can find this kind of information on a university’s homepage or on a page on which the university’s president discusses his/her vision for the school in an open letter to the student body and prospective students. You want to make the school think you will be a perfect fit as one of their students. This is a great way to do that.  Ask your older friends, relatives, or teachers if they have examples of personal statements that you can read. Or you can search for examples on the internet. It is very helpful to see what a successful personal statement looks like before you begin crafting your own.  In a personal statement, you will have a word limit or page limit. This means that you can only include what fits within the maximum allowed characters. So, you can’t afford to waste this precious space on filler or unnecessary information. Decide what is absolutely crucial for you to say in your personal statement and then you can add more if you have the space.   Include the elements that illustrate your commitment to academic and community involvement, as well as other things that will make the committee believe you are a good candidate for their school. Avoid things that could be viewed negatively or misinterpreted.  The personal statement is the perfect place to include things that won’t be obvious in the rest of your application. So, if you are able to list all of your volunteering experience elsewhere in the application, don’t focus on that so much in your personal statement. You don’t want to waste the limited space you have repeating yourself.Remember, the personal statement is usually the only place where you have free reign to decide what information to include. So take careful stock of what you have listed elsewhere in your application and focus on other things in your statement.  If you feel like there were extenuating circumstances that caused a certain outcome, this is the place to explain it.   For example, if you had some kind of illness that caused you to miss a lot of school days and, thus, your grades weren’t as good as they would have otherwise been, you can mention that here. However, be careful not to make it sound like a sob story or like you are looking for sympathy.  There is no way to predict who will be reading your personal statement or what their values and beliefs will be. The last thing you want to do is alienate your reader right off the bat by including something that they vehemently disagree with.A good rule of thumb here is to avoid religious or political topics in general because they are often controversial subjects.  You want to grab your reader’s attention from the beginning.Begin your personal statement with a complete sentence readdressing the original question but providing your own answer. (e.g. if the question was “What was the best experience in your high school career?”, the answer might be phrased “The best experience of my high school career was ...”).   Consider starting with a personal anecdote or clever story that draws the reader in right away.  Continue throughout the statement giving very specific and detailed reasons or justifications for why you feel the way you do. Just answering the question outright isn't enough of a reason for them to believe you, so you should spend the majority of your personal statement giving specific life experiences that justify your position or personal feeling on the given subject. This will also help your reader remember more specifics about your application.For example, say that you volunteered at the Fulton County Humane Society rather than just your local humane society. Or that you won the Norman Mailer Student Writing Award instead of just saying you won an award for writing. Providing specific details like this will help your application stick out more in the minds of the review board members.  Just stopping after some reasons and life experiences isn't enough; you must make the reader understand that you weren't just rambling. Tie together all of the fundamental elements you've written about so far, and summarize your main point.   Try coming full circle and referring back to something you mention at the beginning of your essay. For example, if you begin by discussing a particularly transformational moment in your life, you could close the personal statement by referring back to that experience and how it has helped prepare you to be a successful college student.  Applying to college can be a very competitive process. Some of the top tier schools receive so many applications from qualified students that they have to look for any reason to throw out an application. Often, this can happen from simple grammatical or spelling mistakes in a personal letter. Poor editing in something as important as a personal statement reflects poorly on the student who writes it. You don’t want the admissions board thinking you don’t know how to spell things properly or, worse, that you are a careless student who couldn’t be bothered to re-read their personal statement before submitting it., Word choice is important in a personal statement because you want to sound educated and elegant. The personal statement is no place for slang or curse words. But also, try to use better descriptive words.For example, if you say you “accomplished something,” it sounds much more intelligent than saying you “did” something.  As with most written projects, it is always a good idea to ask someone else to read your personal statement for you. When we write, we get so caught up in what we intend to say, that we often lose sight of what we actually say. An outside party will be able to catch mistakes that your brain simply skims over. They will also be able to see the bigger picture more clearly.It would be especially beneficial to ask someone who has strong writing skills. This could be a parent, a particularly studious friend, or even your English teacher.  Many schools employ people whose job it is specifically to help students who are applying to college. It may be your guidance counselor, or it may be someone with a more specialized position regarding college placement. Either way, this person will have a lot of experience with personal statements and they will be an excellent resource for you. Schedule an appointment with them and ask them to read your personal statement. Ask them for specifics about what you can do to make your letter more impressive.  

read all the materials that you are provided.  research your desired school’s statement of purpose.  read other personal statements.  be selective.  be strategic.  provide explanations when necessary.  avoid controversy.  focus on the introductory paragraph.  provide details.  finish with style.  spend time editing.  think about your diction.  ask someone else to read it.  use your school’s resources. 

 Each player will be picking one spot that they will be shooting from the whole game. Make sure it's behind the 3-point line!; , Everyone will be shooting in order from left to right (or vice versa).  Then the next person shoots. Consecutive makes by everyone can make the pot HUGE. If a player misses their shot, they will receive however much beans are in the "pot".  They can be used as rebounders.  The last man standing wins!  

let each person pick a spot at the three-point line to shoot from.  have one player start by shooting the basketball.  if a player makes a shot, a "bean" is added to the "pot".  first to 7 beans gets eliminated.  play until one person remains. 

 As obvious as this sounds, removing exposure or limiting the amount of time your child is exposed to cats will drastically improve their allergy symptoms., If you're going to visit someone with a cat, warn the hosts about your child's allergy. Ask them to keep the cat out of the the room where your child will be from now until the end of your visit., If you are taking your child to a house where you know there are cats, give your child an allergy medicine a few hours before exposure. This can minimize his reaction and he won't have to be uncomfortable waiting for the allergy medicine to kick in if he takes when he is already exposed to the cat.  Keep your cat out of bedrooms, playpens, off the couch, and generally away from any area where your child spends a lot of time. If you have a finished basement that your child doesn't go into often, keeping the cat segregated in the basement can be viable solution., Reducing the amount of airborne allergens in your home can go a long way in relieving your child's allergy symptoms. Air conditioners with allergen control filters, such as HEPA filters, successfully reduce the amount of airborne allergens in your home., Cat fur and skin can buildup on your couches, in your carpet, on the drapes, and generally anywhere else the cat goes. Invest in a good vacuum cleaner and use it often. Also, use carpet shampoo, de-sanitizing sprays and anti-bacterial wipes often on the surfaces in your home to eliminate any unnecessary allergens left by your cat.Cats, by nature, have a tendency to get into, under, and on top of everything in your home. So make sure you pay attention to areas that you wouldn’t usually consider high-traffic, such as behind the couch or under the bed.  Bathing your cat regularly can help to reduce the amount of dander and excess fur she leaves around the house. As such, washing your cat is another effective step in combating your child’s allergies.It is important to remember that cats don’t like baths, and they naturally do not need them very often. Be sure to check with your vet about safely giving your cat a bath, as bathing her too often can have a negative impact on her physical health.  

reduce exposure to cats.  warn others about your child’s allergies.  give your child an allergy medication a few hours before interacting with a cat.  restrict your cat’s access.  invest in a central air conditioner with an allergen control.  clean often and well.  bathe the cat regularly. 

 You can play the game online within Facebook or on your mobile devices. Launch it, then hit the “Play” button.; , When the game maps loads, navigate through it until you see “167.” Hit the button for the level to begin.  Once you’re in, analyze how your board is laid out. The four chocolate wheels at the corners are blocked by blocks of meringues. The three center columns and center rows are filled with candies. Jellies cover everything underneath. It will be good if you can easily make some special candies to help clear out lots of jellies at the beginning. Do you see good moves to quickly get those?  , If you don’t like your board, go ahead an exit. You won’t lose any life as long as you haven’t touched any candy yet.  Working from the bottom up can improve your chances for unexpected candy matches as candies cascade from the top and settle into open spots on the board.  As soon as the candies blocking the chocolate spawners are cleared, the machines will start releasing chocolate squares., All meringues are double-layered, and are covering single-layer jelly squares. Matching candies next to the meringues will help break down the meringue blockers and provide you with access to the single-layer jellies that lie beneath., Since the goal of level 167 is to clear the jellies, you don’t necessarily have to focus on clearing chocolate squares. The chocolate spawners will continue to release chocolate regardless of whether you’ve already managed to clear all existing chocolate from the board., Special candies such as striped candies, wrapped candies, color bombs, and combinations of these candies can help clear all jellies in fewer than 50 moves.Make striped candies by matching four candies of the same color in a row. Striped candies will clear all candies that reside in the same row or column, depending on the direction in which the stripes on the candies are facing. Make wrapped candies by matching five candies of the same color in a T shape, L shape, or + shape. Wrapped candies will clear out the surrounding eight candies upon detonation. Make color bombs by matching five candies of the same color in a row. When matched with another candy, a color bomb clears all candies of the same color as that particular candy.  At the start of the level, the chocolate wheels cannot generate chocolate as they are blocked by the meringues. As long as the meringues are there, you’re safe from the chocolate. However, there will come a time when you need to break them. All the blocks of meringues also have jellies underneath, which means you need to clear them out to get to the jellies. When you do break the meringues, the chocolate will start to spread.  You can break the chocolate by making a match right next to it. Do not let the chocolate spread all over your board. It will be very difficult to complete the level if it does. Stop the chocolate early before it spreads all over. Note also that some jellies may exist underneath some chocolate. Do not forget to clear them out as well.  This isn’t a time-limited level, so you don’t have to hurry. Take a good look before doing a move.  

start the game.  select the level.  analyze the initial board layout.  restart the level.  start matching candies near the bottom of the playing board first, and work your way up.  clear as many candies from the middle of the board first before focusing on matches near any of the four chocolate spawners.  match any candies adjacent to the meringue squares whenever possible.  clear chocolate squares only if doing so will help you clear jellies.  focus on making special candies that can help you clear all jellies at a faster rate.  watch for the chocolate.  stop the chocolate.  take your time. 

 A Manager should be well aware of a team member’s goals and strive hard to ensure that they succeed in achieving goals. In my experience I have learn that all individual have goals and that inspires them to work hard. The goals can be anything like promotion, Car, House, Technical knowledge improvement, etc. Also if a team member is looking forward to move to a different team in your organization do not find any reason to stop the team member. He would do no good staying back. Example: - Carlos goal is to develop himself in windows and SQL domain; you have a limited work in your team. May be you can share some documents, videos, training that will help him develop himself in free time.; , All the modern organizations set goals at the beginning of the year and expect each team to work hard on achieving them throughout the year. This is the biggest opportunity to make the best of the talented bunch of people in your team. Lay down clear and concise goals in alignment with your organization and work hard with team to achieve them. A team without goals is like a car without steering. Often goals are used as an important steering factor to keep team focused at work. A good thought on Goals,” Set your sights high, the higher the better”.  The biggest challenge for a manager is optimum utilization of resources. A manager should ensure that resources are kept busy at work. As we all are aware,” An empty mind is devil’s workshop”. In my views this is toughest job however not impossible. If you have limited work you involve team members in Knowledge base creations, training, tasks etc. Keeping the team members will ensure that they all are focused at work and not indulging in any wrong activities.  Implement measures to perform a random monitoring of work done by team members as well implement quality audit measure for the team. This will ensure that the team will always be giving their best on deliverables. Also spare some time in sharing the feedback with the team members. This will result in to overall development of team and quality deliverables at workplace.  Although it’s a modern civilization, set very high standards for work ethics, principles and discipline at work. Today in this competitive world people go at any extent to stay on the top. Always share the importance of ethics, principles and discipline at work. Have severe punishments for team members for cheating at work. The most important part is discipline where you the manager play the most important role.  As said by someone,” A leader leads by example, whether he intends to or not”. The team members look at you and follow you. It’s very important that you as a manager set good example for team members in terms of work, professionalism, ethics, principle and discipline. The team will follow you and do what you do. Stretching for a critical deliverables and sitting down with team members for moral support will be a good example.  As mentioned by A Cohen, ”Appreciation is the highest form of prayer, for it acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts.” As a manager it’s very important to recognize good deeds of team members. This will inspire and motivate them to achieve more and contribute more. Also imagine you took an initiative for team and it resulted in success however your superior doesn’t recognize or appreciate it. This is exactly the feeling that team members get when they are not recognize. As a leader you have authority and power to recognize team members however do that with your best judgment and experience.  As mentioned above, set goals for team members and calculate their achievements on those goals on monthly basis. This will made the team members realize the areas that they need to improve. This will certainly produce tremendous results for the organization. Also will set the right expectation among team members about what rating they should expect at the end of the year. I have implemented this and produce tremendous results for my organization.  As said by Saint Augustine,” Punishment is justice for the unjust”. As a human being we don’t really like to punish anybody. Always remember in life we are playing different roles example: Manager, teacher, guide, etc. We need to ensure that we do justified things for the role. If at all after number of requests and warnings we do not see improvement in a team member, he/she deserves to be punished. Collect all the data about the team member’s deed and punished the team members for the wrong deed. Typically now the managers have to report the incidents to the Human Resource department for appropriate action.  As a manager you got to ensure that you used all your resources optimally. Under utilization and over staffing of resources leads to huge financial loss for the company. In today’s competitive world we have to be very diligent about the costs to the company and avoid all the bottle necks leading to high costs.  An outing with team members is a perfect opportunity to break the barrier with them. It is also an important listening forum to understand what team members are conversing about. Team members might get a little cozy about what other company’s have to offer and what are good aspects of other organizations during such outings. Make a point to listen to these points and implement them in your organization if within your capacity. Outing with team members once in a month or may be quarter is refreshing break from work and a great good together of professional friends.  Begin your day full of enthusiasm and positive energy. As said by Robert Collier,” There is little difference in people, but that little difference makes a big difference. That little difference is attitude. The big difference is whether it is positive or negative”. Be very positive in all the task you complete and use the positive energy ins generating great results for the team.  Today business is managed by series of leaders and each team across organization has a leader for effective management. Naturally to grow some mediocre kinds will attempt to play foul games and stop your growth. In such situations do not lose focus. Just stay focused on your task and complete the tasks exceptionally well. The higher management needs results and put your focus on generating results. This way they would look into getting you down while you will keep generating results.  When team members are approaching you with a problem take some time to understand the root cause of the problem. Understand the fact that they are reaching you as they trust you and your abilities to solve their problems. Act as a very powerful problem solver and guide the team members effectively. Use the treasure of your experience to solve the problems. You may also relate some problems with your mentors for effective solutions.  Utilize your time very well. Time management is the key to success for effective management personal. Plan your day effectively and implement all your plans for the day. If you have spare time indulge in learning something new and develop yourself. Spend majority of your time in planning and preparing your team for future.  Once a manager, you're always a manager. Remember it doesn’t take an MBA from MIT to manage people effectively, what it really takes is a passionate spirit who loves the job. Be passionate and love your job. As said by Steve Jobs,” The only way to do great work is to love what you do”. In my experience I observed that my love and passion for my work has really helped me grow professionally as well as generated tremendous results for my organization.  This is a time where you can share the right feedback to the team members. Also its great opportunity for team members to share their concerns with you. There are some items which you cannot share with team members in front of others so 1:1 can be used to discuss these items. As a manager utilize this opportunity to provide constructive feedback to team members and develop them.  The more you grow be humble and generous to people. You have been identified to be a leader as you have been a great performer and you have some great qualities in terms of people management. Be kind to your team members. Be very humble to them in attending issues. Put yourself in their shoes and realize what they are going through. Forgive honest mistakes. Be open to receive feedback and develop yourself. Listen to people around you and do what your soul says is right. 

understand team members' goals and help them to succeed in achieving their goals.  set tough goals at the beginning of the year.  keep the team busy.  monitor work and quality audit.  maintain ethics, principles and discipline at work.  lead by example.  recognize awesome performance.  have monthly pmrp discussions.  have punishments.  make optimum utilization of resources.  have outings with team members.  be energetic and positive.  know how to deal with politics from internal competitors.  know how to understand problems and how to resolve them.  know that time management is the key.  love your work.  work 1:1 with team members: having monthly 1:1 with team members really helps and makes your job easier.  always be kind, humble and generous.  remember that there’s a whole bright world waiting for you to do wonders, go for it!  

 Open and honest communication is the most important aspect of a healthy relationship, and is the key to building trust. Without proper communication, simple misunderstandings can turn into full-fledged fights. Keep your relationship strong and avoid excessive arguing by simply expressing yourself on a regular basis.   Discuss issues as they come up rather than bottling them up and growing resentful over time. Learn how to be diplomatic during arguments. Try not to get overly defensive if your wife is being critical of you. Similarly, try not to sound accusatory or angry when bringing up issues with her. Listen to her. Being a good communicator isn’t just about knowing how to talk. It’s important to give your wife your undivided attention when she is speaking. Look her in the eyes, ask her questions, and don’t look at your telephone or computer screen if she’s speaking about something important. If you are in a bad mood for any reason, then tell her explicitly rather than ignoring her or being short with her. This way, she can give you the space you need without taking your attitude personally.  A healthy relationship is a two-way street. Over the course of your marriage, you will inevitably have to give up certain things to make her happy, and vice versa. If one of you is constantly giving in to the other’s demands without any reciprocation, there will likely be some resentment down the road.  In any long-term relationship, it’s natural for one or both parties to need some alone time to unwind and focus on themselves. There’s nothing wrong with needing time away, but it’s important to be vocal about it and assure her that she shouldn't take it personally.   Designate one "free" day out of the week or month during which you can do your own thing, and let her do the same. If you have children, take turns watching them while the other one is out. Never lie to your wife to avoid having to spend time with her. If she really loves you, she will understand if you need to be alone or spend a night out with the guys.  Studies have shown that the average woman spends 10 more hours each week doing housework than her husband does!Excessive housework and other stress-inducing activities can attribute to decreased sexual desire in both men and women. Help balance out the workload by doing dishes, vacuuming, cleaning the bathrooms, doing yard work, handling repairs, and so on.   The key is to help out around the house even when you have not explicitly been asked to do so. Remember that it is as much your obligation as it is your wife’s to keep the house clean and in shape. If you have children, help your wife by offering to pick the kids up from school, watch them when she is busy, etc.  Some people are more comfortable living in a messy environment than others. To insure that you both feel comfortable in your own home, make sure that your house meets the standards of whoever is most nit-picky about cleanliness.   Just because you’re okay with extra dishes sitting in the sink overnight, your wife may not be, and you should respect that. If your wife is the messy one, then gently remind her every once in a while to clean up her surroundings.  Even your schedule doesn’t leave extra time to do chores around the house, there’s no excuse to not clean up your own messes. The least you can do is wash your own dishes, put your clothes away, and take care of your own laundry.   If you are too busy during the week, then devote an hour or two each weekend to cooking, cleaning, and/or doing yard work.  Living with another person means letting down your guard and seeing each other’s less attractive sides. While this level of comfort is a true sign of intimacy, it can also damage the level of sexual attraction you feel for each other in the long run.   Maintain your personal hygiene, be respectful when it comes to bathroom etiquette, and make an effort to stay in shape.  Getting regular skin-on-skin contact releases a chemical called oxytocin, which reduces stress and increases feelings of intimacy in the long-run.Physical contact doesn’t necessarily mean sex. Kiss her goodbye every time you part ways, hug her when you see each other again, and cozy up in front of a good movie.  Every marriage has its ups and downs, and the only way to make it through difficult times is to maintain a sense of humor and be silly every once in a while. You don’t have to be a stand-up comedian, but you should make an effort to put a smile on her (and your) face every day.   Get tickets to a live comedy show, host game nights with friends, or play sports together; anything to get the laughter going! Getting regular laughter will not only improve your marriage, it can actually improve your health by lowering your blood pressure, increasing oxygen flow to the brain, and reducing stress levels., Just because you’ve put a ring in her finger, doesn’t mean you should stop trying to win her affection. Every once in a while, make the same sweet romantic gestures that you did in the beginning of the relationship. Bring her flowers, get tickets to her favorite show, or plan a surprise romantic evening.  

learn how to communicate.  be willing to compromise.  take time apart when necessary.  help out around the house.  respect her standards for cleanliness.  pick up after yourself.  keep some mystery intact.  get daily physical contact.  laugh together.  surprise her. 

 The LoJack radio signal requires special computer equipment for tracking; not all police departments are equipped to track the LoJack radio signal. A list of counties within states where LoJack coverage is available is available by calling 1-800-456-5225 (1-800-4-LoJack).   The telephone list is usually more current than the list on the website.; , LoJack makes different systems for cars built before 1985 (classic cars) than for cars made after that year. The difference in the units is that the classic car version is self-contained and does not require connection to the vehicle's battery to work.   The LoJack version for cars made after 1985 does include a battery back-up to permit it to work if it is somehow disconnected from the battery.  The basic LoJack Stolen Vehicle Recovery System is the wireless radio transponder described above, which LoJack's certified technicians install somewhere in your vehicle.

 You'll want to make sure you have everything you need before you begin. In addition to the actual building materials, you'll also need several tools, including a power drill, a router, measuring tape, screws, hinges, and one or two hook-and-eye latches for the enclosure's opening.Wood is the primary structural material. You'll be using it to assemble most of the enclosure. High-pressure particleboard with a laminate coating, pre-built shelving, or high-quality plywood are all ideal types of wood for the enclosure. Be sure you stain the wood before beginning. You'll also need to choose between glass or thermoplastic for the panels of your enclosure. Glass and plastic both help retain heat inside the enclosure, though plastic may be more effective.; , Before you measure and cut any pieces, you'll need to decide how large your enclosure should be. This will be determined by the size of your snake. If your snake is still growing, size your enclosure to its estimated adult size, which a breeder or snake expert at your local pet store should be able to tell you.   Generally speaking, most snakes need at least enough space to stretch out across the cage.Smaller sized snakes like garter and grass snakes can be kept in smaller enclosures, so long as they have enough room.Medium- to large-sized snakes, including king snakes, rat snakes, milk snakes, and gopher snakes, require larger enclosures. Be aware that climbing snakes will do better in a taller enclosure, while burrowing snakes will do better in a longer enclosure.  Generally speaking, if your snake is venomous or is capable of moving particularly fast, it's best to put the opening on top of the enclosure. This will help prevent escape attempts while the enclosure is open for feeding or cleaning. If your snake is not venomous and does not move quickly, you can put the opening on the side of the enclosure. Having a side-opening enclosure allows you to stack your snake's habitat between other enclosures (if you have more than one). You will not have this option if you put the opening on the top of the enclosure. If your snake will need an artificial heat source, it may be easiest to put the opening on top of the enclosure. If you're using a glass panel, you may be able to simply place the heat lamp directly on the glass.  Before you can actually build the enclosure, you'll need to measure its components. It's important to be as precise as possible with your measurements since a gap in the enclosure could make it easy for your snake to escape.   Smaller snakes can be kept in a 10- or 20-gallon tank.This measures out to either 20 inches by 10 inches by 12 inches (51 by 25 by 30.5 centimeters), or up to 24 inches by 12 inches by 16 inches (61 by 30.5 by 40.5 centimeters)Medium-to-large sized snakes typically need between 30- and 55-gallon tanks. This measures out to 36 inches by 12 inches by 16 inches (91.5 by 30.5 by 40.5 centimeters) or up to 48 inches by 13 inches by 20 inches (122 by 33 by 51 centimeters). The glass or plastic panel you use as a window for the front of the enclosure should measure a few tenths of an inch (less than a centimeter) shorter than the back wooden panel. This will allow a more precise fit in the grooves that you'll dig out.  Over time, the wood in your enclosure may begin to rot. It will also get dirty and may be difficult to clean if you do not stain the wood first. Staining will help protect the wood to ensure a longer life for your enclosure., Once you've assessed the size needs of your snake and determined the final dimensions, you'll be ready to cut your wood. It can be helpful to mark the sizes in chalk or pencil before cutting so that you have precise measurements and straight lines to cut along.   Make sure you wear personal protective equipment (PPE) while working with wood. This includes safety glasses, gloves, earplugs, a respirator, and a padded kickback apron.Cut each piece as a solid rectangle. You only need to cut the sides, back, top, and bottom. The front face will be a glass or plastic panel held in place by the top, bottom, and sides.  Before you can complete the enclosure's assembly, you'll need to make room for the glass or plastic panel and insert it into place. This will be done using a router to gouge out the wood.Dig the groove 0.5 inches (1.25 centimeters) from the face of what will be the outside wall of the enclosure. You'll need to cut grooves in the front face of the top and bottom pieces as well as down the sides. Slide the glass or plastic panel into each groove to ensure that it fits snugly in place.  Use a power drill to bore holes in the sides, back, and bottom of the enclosure, then screw them into place. If your cage will open from the side, attach the back, bottom, top, and one side of the panel, leaving the opening side unattached.Make sure the grooves for the glass or plastic panel line up evenly. Before you attach the top, slide the glass or plastic panel into place so that your enclosure is complete. If you are making a side-opening enclosure, wait before attaching your chosen side's panel. Make sure there are no gaps around the glass or plastic panel. Use an adhesive that's approved for use around pets to seal up any gaps where the panel fits into your wooden frame. You can find these products at your local hardware store or through an online retailer.  If you're building an enclosure that opens from the top, then you'll be attaching the top panel with hinges. If your enclosure opens from the side, then your chosen side's panel will be the opening that you affix with hinges.Measure where you will need to attach the hinges onto the opening panel (either the top or one side). Then measure where the hinges will attach to the back panel. Use a power drill to bore holes for the hinges, then screw the hinges into place. Attach hook-and-eye latches to each corner of the opening panel. It's typically a good idea to use multiple latches instead of just one since some snakes are strong enough to break through weak doors. Drill several small holes for ventilation in the opening panel (either the top or the side of your enclosure).  Your snake will feel most comfortable if there is some type of substrate at the bottom of the enclosure. The materials you use, though, will depend on your snake and its traditional habitat in the wild.   Snakes that naturally live in the desert will need fine-grain sand for a substrate.For other snakes, unprinted paper (such as unprinted newspaper pages or butcher's paper) can be laid down in shredded layers. Still other snakes will prefer clean leaf litter as a substrate.Talk to a veterinarian or a snake expert at your local pet store to determine what type of substrate would work best for your snake.  Most snakes like some type of vegetative cover since they're typically used to having this in the wild. Different snake species are used to different habitats, and the types of plants you provide should reflect what your snake would live with in nature. However, once you've identified the best type of vegetation, you will need to choose between live plants and artificial plants.Chinese evergreen, ferns, small palms, philodendron, bromeliads, and begonias are all plants that are commonly used in snake enclosures. Live plants can be difficult to maintain and frequently carry pests or diseases. For this reason, many experts advise against using live plants and advocate for artificial plants instead., All snakes need a constant supply of fresh drinking water. Snakes will need food as well. All snakes are predatory carnivores, which means that your snake will need live, frozen, or recently-killed organisms in order to survive.   Try to provide a water dish that is large enough for your snake to immerse itself in.Be sure the water dish you purchase is heavy enough that it will not get tipped over as your snake climbs in or out. The food you feed your snake will depend on the diet of that species. Most pet snake species eat mice, rats, gerbils, or hamsters, though smaller snakes may eat insects, frogs, or amphibians.Ask your veterinarian or a snake expert at your local pet store about what type of diet is best for your snake.  Once you've got everything set up, you'll be ready to introduce your pet snake to its new home. Give your snake time to adjust to its new surroundings before you attempt to handle the snake or remove it from the enclosure, as it may be frightened or confused after being transferred to its new home.  

gather your materials.  plan the size of your enclosure.  determine where to place the opening.  measure your building materials.  apply lacquer to the wood.  cut the wood to size.  dig out a groove for the glass.  assemble the enclosure.  attach the opening panel.  lay down a substrate.  include vegetation.  provide food and water dishes.  introduce your snake to the enclosure. 

 There should be an agreement to pre-pay for an allotted time.; , Believe me, that's plenty of time for a genuine seer to get a lot of information from you psychically as well as tell you what they see in the very near future. Most seers offer special promotions so that you can get your first sample-reading for free. If you are happy with what you hear, then go ahead and decide if you want to continue. But just don't hang up and try to pretend you are someone new so that you can scam free readings. An accurate seer is generally pretty dedicated to giving accurate, reliable information. Like most professionals, they are there to do a job for which they are hired and they don't want to pursue heavy marketing to t.v. audiences which require them to do "tricks" and other magic-looking hocus-pocus.  It's best to keep your question as simple as possible in the beginning and that you try to stay as neutral throughout the reading as much as possible. If you start to show your emotions, this will force the seer to consider holding back on details that you could possibly be very interested in - even though they may not be what you want to hear. For instance, if there's an unwanted event and you get upset about it, s/he might think of focusing on other topics rather than giving you the kind of information that will help you change this event or even stop it from manifesting. Worse, a false seer will use your emotional displays to start to give you an opinion instead of sticking to giving you valid predictions. I used to live in a building near Central Park and downstairs was a little "psychic shop". On a daily basis I would overhear her phoning people to tell them that if they didn't pay her $3000+ to put a spell on their lover that she would instead put bad luck on themselves. Clearly, she had managed to tap into the emotional weakness…and lure her clients into paying more for her personal belief systems. It's not fair and its really not truly psychic.  It's okay if your seer asks you to sit in a certain way or to close your eyes, or to mention the first name of someone you would like to know more about: this simply helps them get connected to you and to start downloading information that you will find accurate. But, if the seer starts to ask you detailed questions about your relationship or who the person is at that point, you are unfortunately not really with a genuine psychic and it's possible you've been taken by a potential fraud.  A professional seer should only predict events, rather than going into the role of becoming a spiritual advisor. On the other hand, if you are interested in spiritual opinions that they may have, by all means ask for them. You may also wish to ask for a different rate though. This is because the ability to see into another person's decisions, thoughts or events is a high quality expertise or skill. Spirituality is really a general community virtue which in my opinion can be shared but it really is not a type of service.  Really accurate and professional-level descriptions of upcoming events, including decisions, is not a luxury the minute you learn how to take advantage of it to do well in your job, your relationship and basically your whole life. At that point, the price of such excellent service is and should be treated like the price of medicine: you don't want to have to depend on medicine the same way you depend on food. Likewise, medicine can get you results much, much faster than food but the idea is that you use it only when the problem debilitates your ability to live off food. In this case, the medicine is the high quality reading that comes at a much higher price than say, advice you give yourself for free or that a friend might give you. Just make sure you don't pay a high price to a seer who is not effective.  Feedback is powerful. I really value their feedback and I know my work is excellent Unfortunately, a lot of my clients prefer to just phone me and not bother writing after every call. That's perfectly alright. And to be honest with you, sometimes I get a client who is angry and/or abusive - especially after a prediction came true that I had warned them about but they didn't believe me. It's rare but it does happen - especially in the hottest weather moments. When it happens, they can leave feedback that is much too personal and even dishonest. Dismiss those. Read the ones that seem objective. Aim to see the ones that say whether or not predictions come true.  For example, if a person is thinking emotionally about their pet's name, then the pet's name can be 'seen' psychically. I remember on CNN how Anderson Cooper and a few others were trying to discredit the entire psychic ability process by asking someone to guess the colour or a number. Again, it is possible but only if there's an event associated with it. Decisions are events. Decisions can only be predicted at the moment of readiness to orient towards it. Truly, no one can predict free will in advance and any seer that says that they can is misleading. Before a decision is made, it is only possible to describe the orientation of a person based on his or her emotions. This is like describing the way a bowling ball is likely to roll based on the 'feel' of the alley and the thrust from the bowler's hand. And yet, only a high quality seer can predict what is also Unpredictable interference or obstacles that are coming up. This is extremely valuable.  Yes, it might be tempting to ask your 'seer' what you should do . Don't! Instead, ask your seer to explore the outcome that would happen if you tried different approaches. List those approaches and let her/him do the work psychically rather than from the basis of an opinion.  

ask what the charge is before you start.  start with no more than three (3) minutes.  never start your reading by being the one to spill out all your personal details before the seer has had a chance to tune into you.  relax.  don't feel you have to take the seer's advice!,  you get what you pay for.  if available, read the customer testimonials from the seer's previous clients.  use a bit of caution about what can be predicted and what cannot: the visions are triggered based on emotions.  after hearing what seems to be an accurate set of predictions about the outcomes ahead, it's up to you to make the decisions you need to make. 

 If your baby was born at full term and has no major health problems, you can start tummy time as soon as you get home from the hospital or birth center – just remember not to put your baby on his or her stomach to sleep (this increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS). Newborns will not be able to move much at first, so limit the time to a few minutes and watch carefully to make sure your baby is comfortable.   Some newborns may be uncomfortable on their stomachs before the umbilical stump falls off. If this is the case, you can postpone tummy time for a few weeks.; , If your baby was premature or has health problems, get a doctor’s approval before beginning tummy time. And, as with all babies, do not put your baby on his or her stomach to sleep.  If you put a little thought into scheduling tummy time, you can maximize the odds that your baby will enjoy it. Pick a time when your baby is alert, cheerful, and unlikely to be hungry, and consider building a routine by doing tummy time right after a diaper change.   You don’t want your baby to be hungry, but in general, it’s best not to schedule tummy time immediately after a feeding, either. This could lead to spitting up. Never do tummy time when you are putting your baby to sleep. This should be a daytime, stimulating activity.  For newborns, you can begin by lying down yourself, on your back, and placing your baby on top of you, stomach to stomach. Your newborn will feel comforted by your closeness and your heartbeat. As your baby grows, you can start using a flat surface (a big bed or a blanket on the floor) instead. Simply place your baby on his or her tummy on the flat surface; watch to be sure that your baby supports his or her head well. Be sure to stay close by and keep a watchful eye throughout the duration of the tummy time.   Babies have to work harder when they are on their tummies, so they may fuss at first when placed face down. Take it slow and pick up your baby if he or she starts crying or gets very upset.  Be sure that the arms are forward in a way that the baby could use them to prop her or himself up. Babies with arms that are restrained or twisted backwards will not only be uncomfortable, but will be unable to reap the full benefits of tummy time.  If your baby gets fussy, you can try sitting down and lying him or her across your lap. Keep one leg raised over the other, and put the baby’s head and shoulders on the elevated leg. Then you can sing, talk, and rub the baby’s back.   You can also try holding your baby under your arm on his or her stomach (taking care to support the muscles until your baby can do so). This isn’t as beneficial as true tummy time on a flat surface, though.  If your baby cannot yet use his or her hands to push up, you can roll up a blanket and place it under the arms for support. Babies sometimes enjoy this change of position.   You can also use a nursing pillow as a prop.  For very young newborns, you can start with just a minute or two at a time, then increase the time gradually, up to around an hour per day by the time your baby is four or five months old.   Your baby does not need to do an hour of tummy time all at once; it’s fine to break the time into several shorter segments.  Don’t just place your baby on his or her stomach and walk away. Instead, you can lie down, facing your baby, on your own stomach. Then just talk, sing songs, make faces – whatever feels natural and keeps your infant entertained.  As your baby grows, you’ll want to add colorful toys to tummy time. Try waving the toy in front of your infant’s head and moving it around; this will encourage your baby to lift his or her head, move it from side to side, and, eventually, to reach for the toy.  If your baby cries or protests, it’s fine to end tummy time prematurely. The key is to offer your baby the chance to get accustomed to that position and exercise different muscles, not to force your baby through some rigid program. Keep tummy time fun and interesting for your baby.  By the end of the first month, your baby may be able to lift his or her head for a short time and move his or her feet a bit, as if crawling.  By two months, your baby may be able to hold his or her head up for a longer period of time and turn it to each side.  By three months, your infant may be able to rest on the forearms and pelvis, especially with support from a blanket. By four months, you may notice that your baby can balance well on his or her stomach, and by five months, you may see that he or she will reach for toys.  Your baby will get stronger and stronger over the first few months of his or her life. By the end of the seventh month, your infant may be able to hold himself or herself up with one hand while reaching for a toy with the other.  Some babies begin to crawl in the eighth or ninth month. You may also see your baby start to pull up to something like a standing position.  

start tummy time immediately for a healthy, full-term baby.  talk to your pediatrician if you have any concerns about putting your baby on his or her stomach.  choose the best time.  start with a familiar, comfortable position.  adjust the baby's arms.  change the position.  prop your baby up.  increase the time slowly.  keep your baby company.  incorporate toys.  don’t force the issue.  watch for your baby’s ability to lift his or her head.  look for head turning.  pay attention to your baby’s balance.  watch your baby’s strength develop.  look for signs of mobility. 

 Have them write down the password and keep it in a safe place where you DON'T know where it is.  Until you are under the time, it will shorten and will stop as late as 15 minutes per day. After a week of perfect under the time, you can recover 15 minutes. This will stop at 2 hours. Then after 2 weeks, will go up one hour. Your goal is to stay under 2 hours with the hour wiggle room. After 2-4 months of having a close to perfect record, (1-3 times) you can get rid of the parental controls for good. This should keep you under 2 hours of phone time now.  

have your child, or spouse create a password for parental controls so you don't have more than 2 hours a day to be on it.  if you don't comply and you run out of time before you get home from work, then have them shorten the time by 10 minutes every week. 

 You may be dying to be back with your ex-boyfriend, but the worst thing you can do is hang around him incessantly, call him, or wink at him in class until he gets the picture. If you're always around, he probably does get the picture, but it won't be one that he likes. Instead, you should take a breather and stop hanging around him, at least for a few weeks or longer.   You can decide whether you want to cut off contact completely, or if that's impossible because of school. Stop calling or texting him. Even if you think of something funny that reminds you of him, it's better to hold off. Try to avoid seeing him at all, even when you're hanging out with mutual friends. If you do catch yourselves at the same party, you don't have to be rude to him, but you shouldn't spend too much time talking to him. You don't have to be rude to take a break from your ex. If you do run into him, you don't have to run away, but you don't have to linger and talk about nothing either.; , While you distance yourself from your boyfriend, you'll be in a good position to reflect on the problems in the relationship. If you want to get your man back, then you have to figure out what it was that went wrong, so you don't do it all over again. The problem could be simple, or it could take a bit longer to figure out. Here are some of the things that could have gone wrong:   Maybe you were too jealous or controlling, and he couldn't handle it anymore. Maybe you didn't spend enough time together. Maybe he felt like you weren't caring or affectionate enough. Maybe he felt like you were too clingy and were always around. Maybe there was a situational change, like one of you having to move to a different town, or maybe he was leaving for college in just a few months and wanted to break it off. Maybe you were just always fighting and didn't get along.  Once you figure out what went wrong in the relationship - which could be a combination of problems instead of just one - it's time to think about how you can make things different next time. You don't want to make your ex-boyfriend want you back if you'll just run into the same problems and drama all over again.   You need to work on making some big changes, whether it's controlling an aspect of your personality that led to the downfall of the relationship, or to think about how you can change the dynamics of the relationship if it started again. If the problem was that you were jealous, you need to think about how you can be less jealous. If he thought you were too bossy or controlling, you need to tone down that aspect of your personality. If you fought all the time, you can think about how you can be less combative. If the problem had to do more with him, then you can think about how you can be together again without this issue -- maybe he'll be willing to change. But if he's not willing to change and you know this will be an issue long term, then you should consider whether or not it's worth it to get him back.  Take some time to work out whatever problem may have ended your relationship, and just spend time enjoying your own company or hanging out with friends. Make a list of three flaws that you'd like to change about yourself, and slowly start to address them. It takes a lifetime to grow as a person, but even taking small steps to become your ideal steps can help your relationship.   If you have some quality "me time," your ex will start to wonder where you are. If you're busy focusing on yourself, that will make him think about you even more. Spend time with your girlfriends, working out, or pursuing your favorite hobbies. Take some time to work on yourself, but not too much time. If you spend months addressing your issues and completely fall out of the picture, your ex may have moved on.  

take a break from your ex-boyfriend.  think about what went wrong.  make a game plan for addressing the problem.  work on yourself. 

 Students generally talk to their friends about tests and even about the answers to tests.   For example, keep an eye on students who leave your first period class after a test. If they walk a little with a second period student, they may be sharing answers or passing cheat sheets.  Some students will create a private group on Facebook or Google for the class, using it to exchange notes. If the class is large enough, you might be able to sign up for the class posing as a student, using an assumed name.Some course management systems, such as Blackboard, have an option of letting students email each other without the instructor seeing the emails. Change the preferences so that you also see the emails that students send out through the system.  Often, students might pretend that they are interested in the class, visiting you in office hours and engaging with the class material. These students might butter you up so that you don’t suspect them of cheating because you perceive them to be good students., Do not allow students to be in your classroom when you are not there. Lock filing cabinets and desk drawers to prevent students from looking at tests, and watch for this behavior when you are in the classroom as well.   Create and memorize complex passwords for computer and grade book log-ins; do not write this information on paper.  

listen to hallway conversations.  sign up for the class social media group under an assumed name.  be cautious with favorite students.  protect your physical and digital spaces. 

 Line a shallow baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil.  Line them up side by side, leaving space in between each link. Space the links apart as evenly as possible.  Place the baking sheet on the middle rack of the oven to ensure even cooking. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes.   Note that thicker sausages may need to bake longer. Extremely large or thick links may need to be baked anywhere from 40 to 60 minutes. If cooking them this long, however, you should turn the sausages at least once.  The tops of the Italian sausage links should be lightly browned, but not charred.  

preheat the oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit (200 degrees celsius).  place the sausage links on the baking sheet.  cook the sausages in the preheated oven.  remove the links from the oven once they start to brown. 

 Spray some aerosol hairspray onto a clean cloth and use this to scrub at the marker stain. You may need to use more hairspray or switch to a cleaner section of the cloth before the stain is fully removed.   Once the stain has disappeared, clean off any hairspray residue with a clean, damp cloth and work a little leather conditioner into the furniture.  To clean a marker stain from microfiber upholstery, apply a small amount of hydrogen peroxide to a clean towel and use this to scrub at the stain for 10 15 minutes.   Next, apply a little rubbing alcohol to a different towel and use this to scrub the stain for 10 to 15 minutes. Use a third clean towel dampened with water to clean off any remaining marker. Blot the area dry using a dry towel.  Other types of upholstery will usually respond to stain removal using Windex, rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover. All of these use the same method:   Apply a little of your chosen cleaning agent to a clean, dry towel and use it to dab at the stain (not run) until clean. Some people find that towels that match the color of the upholstery work best. You may need to apply the cleaning agent to a new section of the towel and continue dabbing a number of times before the stain comes away. Just don't let the fabric become soaked in the cleaning agent, as this could stain. Once the stain has been removed, pat up any excess moisture in the fabric using a clean, dry towel. If possible, place the furniture outdoors to dry completely.  

use an aerosol hairspray on leather upholstery.  use hydrogen peroxide and rubbing alcohol on microfiber upholstery.  use windex, rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover on other furniture. 

 Mineral extraction usually occurs at some time in the future as equipment and employees are often scheduled years in advance. If you do not start mining or drilling operations before the expiration of a lease, then all rights to the property and the minerals reverts back to the owner.Oil and gas have the ability to cross property boundaries underground. Some states require drilling companies to specify how oil and gas royalties will be shared among adjacent property owners., There is usually no guarantee that gas or oil will be present, so it would be to your advantage to pay a smaller amount for a lease rather than purchasing outright that will cost more. A lease gives you the right to test the property for minerals., Speculators buy the property with the goal to sell the mineral rights to another company who will do the actual production. It is an opportunity to acquire valuable property from individual owners and sell those properties to mining companies for a higher price than what you paid., In an option transaction a property owner is offered a small amount of money today for the option of buying the property at a certain price before a specified date in the future. You would then quickly try to find someone who will pay an even higher price, purchase the property from the owner, and then sell the buyer your mineral rights. If you fail to pay the specified price by the expiration date of the option, the property owner keeps the option payment., Companies such as Patriot Royalties do all the purchasing of mineral rights and the mining. Investors receive monthly income, and you don’t pay taxes on 15% of the production from a well.   Like other assets, oil and gas royalties can be bought, sold or transferred. The royalty income lasts for as long as the well produces, which may be several decades.  Most mining and drilling activity is regulated by state law. These laws may restrict extraction or require additional expenses, so make sure you are familiar with all regulations relating to extracting the minerals. Also, consider that laws may change or new laws and regulations may be passed which impact your ability to extract minerals.   Note that if you are merely receiving royalties and are not the majority owner of the mineral rights, you have no say in the production schedule. If the majority owner decides prices are too low, they may cease production at any time, which will stop the flow of royalties.  

determine the advantages of buying vs. leasing mineral rights.  lease rather than purchase gas and oil rights.  purchase the mineral rights as a speculator.  purchase mineral rights as an option.  invest in oil and gas royalties.  familiarize yourself with local and state laws. 

 Usually, people do not want to go to court, therefore, many people attempt to resolve any disputes they have with each other outside of court. Even if someone has wronged you, it may be better to try and work it out with them before filing a lawsuit.   For example, if someone owes you money, you should ask the person for the money repeatedly before suing them for it, and consider setting up a payment plan with them if they are having financial difficulty. If the payment plan works out, you will likely get the money that is owed to you must faster than if you sued for it. Lawsuits can be time consuming and very expensive to get involved in, so you should try anything you can to work out your issue, and only file a lawsuit as a last resort.; , Many companies, such as banks, insurance companies, and companies that provide services (cable/cell phone etc.), include mandatory arbitration or mediation provisions in the contracts you sign with them.   These provisions mandate that you cannot sue the companies because you instead must resolve any dispute through one of the out-of-court dispute resolution methods. Therefore, if you have signed a contract that has a mandatory Alternative Dispute Resolution clause, you will not be able to bring a lawsuit. , Before you file a lawsuit, you need to do some preliminary investigation to make sure that the law is on your side. If you do not have a valid legal claim, any lawsuit you bring will be dismissed by the court, and you will have wasted time and money.   For example, if someone “promised” to give you $100 as a gift, you legally would not be able to sue them for the $100 if they didn’t give it to you, because the court will not force someone to give something for free. Similarly, if you are involved in a car accident with someone, but you were not injured and your car was not damaged, you will not have a valid claim because you do not have any damages, even if you know that the accident was not your fault.  Even if you do have a valid legal claim, you should assess the strength of your case before you file a lawsuit. To determine whether you have a strong case, consider the following: Whether you have evidence: you should consider whether you can prove what happened in a court of law. For example, if you need witnesses, were any present, and will they be able to testify at trial? If you need papers or documents to support your claim, do you have them, or can you get them before the trial? Whether your opponent has a convincing story: you should consider whether or not your opponent has a convincing story that conflicts with yours. If so, you should consider how you will convince the court that your story is better. Whether you can prove the legal elements: you need to know the elements or facts that you legally must prove to win your case. For example, in a “breach of contract” lawsuit, you must have enough evidence to prove that there was a valid contract. Without proving the existence of a contract, you cannot show that there was a “breach.” Whether you can collect money from your opponent: you need to know whether or not you will be able to collect a judgment if you win your lawsuit. It will not be worth the money and time it takes to bring a lawsuit if your opponent doesn’t have any money or assets, because you will not be able to collect anything, even if you win. However, if money is no object, you may want to consider a lawsuit anyway in order to get validation that your opponent was wrong. Who could be responsible: before filing a lawsuit, you should think of all of the possible parties that could be legally responsible for your harm. For example, if you were involved in an accident with a truck driver, you may consider suing not only the truck driver who struck you, but also his employer, if he was working at the time of the accident.  You must file your lawsuit within the time that your state laws set as the “statute of limitations” for your type of claim. All states have their own time limits depending on the type of case.   For example, one state may allow a plaintiff who wants to file a personal injury suit 1 year from the date of the injury, while another state may allow 4 years from the date of the injury. As a good rule of thumb, you will be okay if you file your lawsuit within a year from the date of the harm, no matter what type of claim you have or what state you live in.  An experienced attorney can help you win your court case. Additionally, an attorney will be able to help you navigate the unfamiliar and sometimes complex court system.   If you do want to hire an attorney, choose someone who has at least 3 years of experience, possibly more if your issue is extremely complex (for instance, a medical malpractice case). Most attorneys offer free consultations, so you can “interview” as many as you want until you find a good fit. Choose an attorney who has experience and strong knowledge of the law, and who you think that you would get along with and like working with. If the attorney makes you uncomfortable in any way or seems dismissive of your case or your situation, you should choose someone different to represent you. To find an attorney near you, consider talking to friends and family members who have used an attorney before. Find out who they hired, for what type of service, and if they would recommend the attorney. You can also find an attorney by checking online reviews. Many websites offer free reviews of businesses. Some places to look for lawyer reviews include: Find Law, Avvo and Yahoo Local.  The law establishes limits on which courts have “jurisdiction” (power) to hear and decide a case. You must file your lawsuit in a court that has jurisdiction over your case.   Generally, you should file a case that deals with a state law in state court. The majority of cases, including personal injury cases, landlord-tenant cases, breach of contract, divorce, and probate matters, a state law claims. There are a few types of cases that should be filed in “federal court” instead of state court. If your case is based on a federal law, you can sue in federal court. A few examples of cases under federal law include suing a police officer under the federal civil rights statute (called a 1983 case) or suing because a government organization has unlawfully discriminated against you.  Usually, you should file your state court case in the state where the actions occurred. For example, if you are suing for injuries sustained at your workplace in Delaware, you would want to sue in Delaware. Once you figure out which state to sue in, you also need to figure out which court in that state is the correct one to sue in. Most states have different “levels” of courts that plaintiffs can file in depending on how much money they are asking for. Typically, states will have the following courts (which may have different names) to choose from:   Small claims court: small claims courts will usually hear claims that involve a certain amount of money - usually up to $2,500 - $5,000. Courts for medium-sized claims, often called “district courts:” usually, the district court will hear cases that involve claims of up to $25,000, Courts for any cases with larger claims, often called “circuit courts:” there is usually a court that will hear claims that are about $25,000, and also certain specialized statutory claims that specify in the law which court will hear them. If you file your claim in federal court, you will always file in the “district court.”  , To sue someone, you must prepare a document called a complaint that you will file with the court. The complaint includes the grounds or cause of action for your lawsuit.   If you have a lawyer, she will draft and file your complaint. If you are filing on your own, you can use a legal book or CD of legal forms to write out your complaint. You can also copy the style of an existing complaint you find on the Internet or from another lawsuit that was filed in your jurisdiction. For more information on how to write and format a pleading, visit WikiHow’s Guide on How to Format a Legal Pleading.  After your complaint is completed, you should take two copies to the court where you are filing your suit. You will give your complaint, along with a “filing fee” to the court clerk. The clerk can also answer questions that you may have about the process.   In some states, you must sign your complaint in the presence of the clerk or get it notarized. Check your state court’s website to see if this applies to you. You do not need to make an appointment to file your complaint. However, you should make sure that you go to file the complaint during the regular business hours of the court.  The court cannot locate a party for you. You must have a current physical address, such as a home or work address, in order to sue someone. This is because the rules of procedure require that you provide a defendant notice of the lawsuit and give him or her an opportunity to respond. Most states allow you to serve a defendant by mail, or by personal service, through the County Sheriff or a process server. Some things to consider when deciding where and how to serve the defendant:   Your state may require personal service of the initial Complaint: if personal service is required, you will need to have the County Sheriff or a process server serve the defendant. When serving via the County Sheriff, the Clerk’s Office and/or the Court will take care of making the arrangements. Personal service may or may not be offered by your County Sheriff’s Department. If the Sheriff offers personal service, there may be a fee. Call the County Clerk or the Sheriff’s Office to determine if process service is offered, and what the fee is. Your state may require a signature from an appropriate person when serving the defendant. Check with your state’s Rules of Procedure for service or with an attorney in order to determine if the process server may leave a copy of the Complaint at the defendant’s home or work, or if a signature is required. If allowed for the initial Complaint and Summons, service by mail is usually sufficient and reliable, and is usually less expensive. However, if you have any reason to believe the Defendant may attempt to hide from service, it may be best to pay for personal service.  After you file your lawsuit, you will need to gather the evidence you will use to prove your claim. Typically, you can request evidence from the other party (called “discovery”). Discovery allows the parties to get investigatory information on the case from the opposing party. Discovery includes:   Requesting documents from your adversary, Sending “interrogatories,” (or written questions), to your adversary that must be answered under oath in writing, “Deposing” your adversary by asking oral questions that must be answered in person, under oath (this is a little bit like an interview), and Writing and sending the opposing party “requests for admission,” which are essentially requests that the opposing party admit under oath that certain facts are true.  Informal investigation can include the following:   interviewing witnesses, getting documents from someone other than your opponent, taking pictures (either of the scene of the accident, of the damaged property etc.), and finding out as much as you can about your adversary without speaking to them, or contacting your adversary without your attorney’s help to ask questions. If possible, try to investigate your case using “informal discovery” type practices as opposed to formal discovery.Formal discovery can be extremely expensive and also very complex, so sometimes its better to investigate on your own, especially if you don’t have a huge amount of money at stake.  Depending on the facts of your particular case, you may file a “motion for summary judgment.” A motion for summary judgment is a pleading that can be filed by either party, assuming that the party believes that depositions and affidavits demonstrate that there are “no genuine issues of material fact” that a jury needs to consider for a verdict to be rendered.   Essentially, this type of motion argues that there are no issues of the facts, so the case can be decided by the judge on the basis of the law only. Discuss the possibility of a motion for summary judgment with your attorney. If you do not have an attorney and your opponent files a motion for summary judgment, you should argue in response that there are facts that are disputed, and those facts are what will determine the outcome of the case.  Even after filing a lawsuit, you can still try to work things out with your opponent. In fact, most cases actually “settle,” or a worked out, before trial. Settling with the opposing party is a good idea for many reasons including:   Settling will save you time: trials are often long and drawn out, therefore, settling now means that as a plaintiff, you will receive money sooner rather than later. Settling is easier than trial: as someone representing yourself, going all the way through the trial can be stressful due to the complex and unfamiliar nature of the legal system, settling will save you from having to navigate all the way through a trial on your own. Settling insures you agree to the outcome of the case: if you end up going to trial, you really have no idea how the judge or jury will decide your case. Additionally, sometimes, even if you should win, you don’t (or you don’t win nearly as much money as you are entitled to). Because settling a case means that the case doesn’t have to go all the way through the legal system, judges often encourage parties to settle cases as well, and sometimes provides help to parties who want to try and work it out. Ask the clerk in the court where you filed your lawsuit whether there are any resources available to parties who want to settle.  Mediation is an “alternative dispute resolution” technique where a third party “neutral mediator” (that is, someone who is not on your side, or your opponent’s side), yourself and your opponent discuss the case and try to come to an agreement on a settlement. The mediator is there to help the parties discuss the issues without getting angry or frustrated with each other. Many states offer low cost programs that supply mediators for various types of cases, including landlord-tenant disputes, divorce cases, and disputes between neighbors. To prepare for a mediation session, do the following:   Think about what outcomes would be acceptable to you: think about what you want from your opponent, and don’t limit yourself to asking for money. For example, many people want an apology from the person who they think wronged them. Prepare to show the mediator the evidence that supports your claim. This will allow the mediator to get an idea of whose side of the case is “better,” and, even though the mediator cannot force you or your opponent to accept a settlement, they may be able to discuss the chances each party would have at trial. Remember that the goal of mediation is come up with a settlement that works for both parties. Don’t go into mediation with a mindset that you have to “win” or “punish” your opponent. Instead, you should be prepared to work collaboratively with the mediator and your opponent to come up with a creative solution to your issues.  In addition to mediation, you may consider participating in “arbitration” to resolve your lawsuit. Arbitration is similar to a trial, but is more informal.   In an arbitration proceeding, you and your opponent present oral testimony, documents, and other evidence to a neutral third party (the arbitrator) who then makes a decision based on both sides case, usually called an “award.” Unlike mediation, an arbitrator’s award is binding on the parties, so whatever the arbitrator decides goes. Arbitrators are trained, and are almost always retired judges or lawyers. You should prepare for arbitration the same way that you would prepare for trial (see below for more information).  If you do proceed to trial, your case will either be decided by a judge or a jury. Usually, the parties decide whether to have the case decided by a judge or jury.   In some cases, you may want to ask for a judge and not request a jury.If you are representing yourself, a trial before a judge is likely to be more informal, and you will not have to worry about the jury’s impression of you in the courtroom. You should ask for a jury if your case has “emotional appeal” and you think the jury may be sympathetic to your cause. However, keep in mind that this can backfire if someone on the jury doesn’t like you. Keep in mind that the trial will have all of the same “parts,” regardless of whether you are in front of a judge or a jury.  The “opening statement” is a type of speech given at the start of trial. It is your first opportunity to introduce yourself and your case. If you filed the lawsuit (and therefore are the plaintiff), you will give your opening statement first, followed by the defendant.   In your opening statement, you should give an overview of what your case is about and what your evidence will prove. You should begin proving your case by telling the jury what evidence is in your favor and what happened to you. Keep in mind that you cannot state your own opinions in an opening statement, and if you do so you could be reprimanded by the judge.  During the presentation of the case, you will call your own witnesses, and “examine” them (this is called direct examination). You will also have the opportunity to ask questions of your opponent’s witnesses (this is called cross examination). To prepare for calling and examining your witnesses, make sure that they all agree to be present at the trial.   For direct examination, you should prepare a notebook with an outline of what you want to ask the witnesses. Ask questions that will encourage the witnesses to talk, instead of “yes” and “no” questions. To get comfortable with questioning witnesses, you can meet with them to practice beforehand. For cross examination, realize that you probably won’t get that much useful information, and limit or completely forgo examining the opposing witnesses. Only cross examine the opposing witnesses if you can get evidence from them that supports your version of events or discredits their trustworthiness as a witness. Always be kind and polite to any witnesses, even during cross examination. Arguing with or badgering a witness (even an opposing witness) looks bad to the jury, and could get you in trouble with the judge.  A closing argument is delivered at the end of a trial, after all of the evidence has been presented and all witnesses have been called. A closing argument is the last chance you will have to address the judge or the jury.   Closing arguments are usually between 10 and 20 minutes, but, if the case is extremely complicated, they can be much longer, in some cases up to one hour. Unlike an opening statement, which can be written well in advance of the trial, a closing argument will be based on the events of the trial, so to prepare an effective closing argument, make sure that you take notes throughout the trial. To see in-depth information about preparing a closing argument, visit wikiHow’s guide on writing a closing argument.  Even after the trial has ended, the losing party can appeal the loss to a higher court. An appeal is a request to a higher court to review and overturn the decision of a lower court. In federal court, appeals are heard by the United States Court of Appeals. In state court systems, the appeals courts go by various names. If you think you might want to appeal the decision in your case, make sure you understand the following:   How appeals are decided: generally, the courts of appeal do not want to tell the trial judge that he made the wrong decision, or “overrule” that decision. Therefore, an appeals court will usually only overturn the decision of a lower court if the lower court made a significant error of law.What a “significant error of law” is will be completely different depending on each particular case. What evidence you can present: The courts of appeals do not look at any new evidence that may have been discovered after the case was decided (either by the judge or the jury). Instead, the court will look at the documents from the case, a “brief” by both parties discussing why each one believes that they have the correct view, and in some cases, will listen to both parties argue your case in front of the court (this is referred to as “oral argument). The consequences of an unsuccessful appeal: if a party unsuccessfully appeal the court’s order, the higher court will “affirm” the lower court’s ruling (or the jury’s), and the current judgment will stand. For more information on appealing a court order, visit WikiHow’s guide on Appealing a Court Order.

 When choosing healthy proteins, salmon and tuna are your best options. These are rich in omega 3 fatty acids, which are great for heart health, as well as high in protein and vitamin D. When choosing rolls, look for rolls that contain salmon and tuna.However, just because a roll has salmon or tuna does not necessarily mean it's healthy. Watch out for high calorie ingredients, like cream cheese, for optimal health.; , Eel is a healthy source of omega 3 acids as well, but is often prepared in brown, sugary sauces. It's best to limit yourself to one eel roll when eating at a sushi restaurant. This will help you avoid extra sugar and calories., The little additives, the better. The fish found in sushi is very healthy, but additives can add unnecessary calories. Look for rolls that mostly fish, rice, and seaweed. Stay away from rolls with additives like cream cheese, tempura, and mayonnaise. Stick to mixtures that mostly use fish and vegetables., How meat is prepared can affect its health. When choosing meats, look for steamed, grilled, and raw options. These meats have not been tampered with as much, which means they will have less added calories from things like sauces, sugars, and oils. 

go for salmon and tuna.  limit your intake of eel.  opt for fish without added ingredients.  look for meats that are steamed, grilled, or raw.

 The law allows employer-sponsored retirement plans to extend loans, but it is up to the plan whether or not it wants to allow loans. Accordingly, you should check to see if your plan allows loans to be made. If the plan administrator agrees to give you a loan, then you can take it without the 10% penalty.   Some plans might allow you to take a loan but limit what you can spend the money on. For example, a plan might allow you to take a loan only to pay for educational or medical expenses.You can also take a short-term loan from an IRA.; , In a calendar year, you can generally borrow up to 50% of the vested balance in the retirement account, up to $50,000.You will have to pay interest on the loan. Although rates will vary, it is common to have to pay the “prime rate” plus one percent. You can find the current prime rate in the newspaper. Some plans have a minimum amount, so you must take at least that much out in a loan.  You should check with your plan administrator whether or not you can take out the loan. The administrator should be able to tell you whether you qualify for a loan and supply you with the necessary forms.  Loans must be paid back. If you borrow from an IRA, then you must pay the loan back within 60 days.If you borrow from a 401(k), then you must pay back all of the loan before you terminate employment. If you don’t, then the unpaid balance will be considered income, which is subject to both income tax and the 10% penalty.Think about whether or not you are planning to leave your job or if there’s a chance the company might be laying people off. If you lose your job, then you may have only 60 days to pay back the balance otherwise you will be hit with the penalty. Also check how close you are to retirement. You might want to take early distribution if you are 55 or older.  

check if your plan allows loans.  identify how much you need.  call your plan administrator.  make repayments. 

 Putting a (temporary) barrier between the two of you bolsters his surprise and delight when you appear gorgeously dressed and smiling., It may be as simple as buying tickets to a movie he wants to see or a pint of his favorite ice cream. Little surprises along the way brighten his life and break up the usual routine.   Be sure to let him know there's a surprise in store. Drop a suggestive hint like, "Just wanted to make sure you're free tonight because you have a little something waiting for you.", Making up a little code that he probably won't be able to crack keeps you on his mind all day as he tries to figure out what "cot pets roll day" means. ("Let's play doctor!")Anagrams (scrambling the letters in a word or phrase) are great for this.  It doesn't need to be anything eloquent; just leaning in and saying something for his ears only creates a sphere of intimacy and can help bring you out of routine conversations. It can be a simple "I love you," or a question you were going to ask him anyway, like, "Want to go for a walk with me?"   You can even do this when there's no one else around - even better!  

close the door when you're getting ready for a date.  surprise him.  send a cryptic message.  whisper to him.

 You should start by having a detailed discussion with your manager to determine exactly how they want you to handle the handover. Depending on your job and how your manager likes to work, you may be asked to contribute extensively to the handover. This could include the new person shadowing you for a few days or longer.In most instances you will have to at least prepare a formal handover document. Discuss this with your manager and find out how much you are expected to contribute, and what the focus of your handover should be.; , Once you have a clear idea of your manager’s expectations, you can start by drawing up a draft handover document. This will help you to organise yourself, and catalogue all the various tasks and pieces of information that you will need to pass on during the handover period. This document should include:   Detailed information on your day-to-day activities, tasks and priorities. An outline of the key points of the role. An clear outline of what is expected of your successor. A list of any essential files that will be handed over. This might include a particular contract, or work programme., If you know you will be leaving your post soon, it can be helpful to put in a little extra work to make sure that you tie up any loose ends. You will get a sense of satisfaction at achieving this, and you will also be helping your successor start off with a clean slate. Doing this will also help ensure that you leave on excellent terms and with a good reputation.This won’t always be possible, but if you have something that is nearly over the line, put in a little extra work to get it done. A new person coming into a deal right when it is near the line may struggle to get it closed, because they are unfamiliar with all its intricacies.  Before your successor is due to start, try to make some time to talk to your colleagues about the handover and ask if there is anything your colleagues think you should highlight. If there is a developing issue that you are unaware of, this is a good opportunity to touch base and find out.   Developing issues are not likely to affect your final days, but if you are aware of them then you can flag them up to your successor. This is also a chance to make sure everyone knows you’re leaving and when. Let your colleagues know about the handover period, so that they can take it into consideration. Your productivity is likely to slow during the handover, so its good practice to give your colleagues some advance warning.  The final step of your handover preparation is to complete a formal handover document. You can build on the draft document, but try to elaborate and include all the important information. You will need to run through the document with your manager and any other key staff it will affect. Try to have this completed and sent to your successor at least a few days before they are set to start. The content will vary from job to job, but it may include some of the following:A list and timetable of actions. A briefing of ongoing issues. A calendar of forthcoming events and deadlines. Passwords and login information. A list of useful contacts.A guide to navigating files and folders on the computer system.  When your successor begins in the office, you may still be around and be asked to do a more complete handover. The length of this will vary, but in some instances you will be given a few days or longer to help the new person get to grips with the job. Generally the more time you have available for a full handover, the more information you will be able to pass on.   There are bound to be things that you forgot about, and having someone shadow you is a good way to expose them to the variety of day-to-day activity.  During the handover, it is good practice to ensure that all the key pieces of data and documentation and handed over personally. This will help you to make sure that the most important things are dealt with appropriately and priorities are clearly set out. Handing over documents face-to-face means that complex information can be discussed fully before you leave.   This opportunity to explain key information, and for your successor to ask you direct questions is vital for a good handover. This will also give you an opportunity to provide nuance and context in a discussion that might have been overlooked otherwise., If you are in the office with your successor, you should always be attentive and proactive. Make the effort to identify and help resolve any occurring issues. Your successor may be a little shy or intimidated in their first few days, and may not want to hassle you with questions.   Make sure you make it clear that you are there to help, and you welcome queries. By doing this, you will be helping to foster a situation in which the responsibility for the handover is shared between you and your successor., The last thing to do before you leave and complete the handover, is to do full handover meeting with your successor. Ask your successor to bring along any outstanding questions they have, and the notes they have made. This meeting is a great opportunity for the new person to ensure that they understand their role and responsibilities.   Any uncertainties can be cleared up in the meeting. Depending on where you work, it might be prudent to invite your manager or supervisor to attend the meeting. You should certainly inform your manager of when and where it is taking place, and ask them if there is anything they would like to add., Try to think of the handover as an opportunity for you to really contribute to giving someone the best possible chance to succeed. You are not just trying to hand off tasks and jobs, but are trying to help your successor’s professional development and your former employer’s long term-health.Do this by pointing out any relevant training opportunities that you know of. Perhaps when you started the job, you received a suite of training to help you adapt and develop. Be sure you mention this to your successor, and encourage them to explore the possibilities.  If you are spending time with the person who will be filling your position, it’s important not to focus solely on technical aspects of the job. Each place has a unique working environment and culture that can be intimidating or confusing for a newcomer. Be sure to set some time aside to give the new person the lowdown on how the office functions.   Make the effort to take them around the office and introduce them to everyone. Be sure you clearly define the role of the new employee as well as existing employees. If the job description of the new arrival is slightly different to yours, or their responsibilities and priorities are focussed elsewhere, make sure existing staff recognise this., If you really want to go the extra mile, you could provide the new employee with your contact details. You might say that they can contact you if there is a major issue or they need a little guidance. Not everyone will be happy to do this, and it is likely to depend on your relationship with your former employer.   Often a problem can be resolved with a simple email. Offering to help out after you leave will make a good impression and help boost your reputation. 

discuss the handover with your manager.  draw up an early outline of your handover document.  tie up loose ends.  communicate with your colleagues.  write up a formal handover document.  allow as much time as possible.  hand over key documents personally.  make the effort to help.  have a final handover meeting.  highlight available support and training.  don’t neglect the working culture.  provide your contact details. 

 That is, after you have the pieces of fabric you want to work with. Cut them to size and then cut out the corners -- around 2" (5 cm) is a good size.          Corners are virtually impossible to knot or braid. This makes everything much easier and keeps you from wondering what the heck to do with those pesky edges.  An easy way to do this is with painter's masking tape. Mark a line down all four sides of your blanket (on the top side). Keep it in line with the depth of your corner cuts.          Make your cuts. You'll want around 1 1/2" (1.9 cm) to 2" (2.5 cm) for your fringe depth. The width of each piece should be around 1" (2.5 cm). Grab your rotary cutter are start making slits down all four lengths of the blanket.  If you're knotting, congratulations! All you have to do is double knot the top and bottom layers of fringe together. Start at one edge and grab two pieces of fringe that are laying on top of each other. Double knot and work your way around. If you're braiding, continue reading:          Make slits in each piece of fringe. That's right: there will be little teeny holes in all your fringes -- that's how they'll stay braided together.  Any will do. Use a bent paperclip (a crochet hook will work great too) and stick it through the slit of your first fringe.          Then stick the paperclip through the slit of the fringe underneath. It will "hook" the second fringe and you can pull it through the first fringe.  Once you've pulled it all the way through on your first move, your paperclip (or crochet hook) should already be through the slit of the second fringe, and you can move on to the next fringe on the top. Put the paperclip through the next slit to hook the next fringe. If you're right handed, it'll be easiest to work right to left and vice versa.          The most important thing is to always alternate between using a fringe on the top and a fringe from the bottom. When you get to the corners, just keep doing the same thing. It will naturally curve around the corner.  Use them to tie a knot around the first fringe. Make sure to do at least a double knot and triple if the fringe is long enough. That will be the only knot on your entire blanket.          You're done! And no, the edge will not unravel. As long as you've knotted the last piece, you're good to go.  

cut out a square in each corner.  mark and cut the fringe.  decide whether you are braiding or knotting your edges.  choose a piece of fringe to start with.  continue pulling through and "braiding.",  cut the very last piece of fringe in half.

 It will also help if your parents are at the door or place where you are being dropped off for the night. Ask if they could come up to the door with you so that you can say goodnight.  If you are staying with friends while your parents are out of town, if there are events planned such as church or a school function, you will be more comfortable having your own clothes.  Don't bring a lot of toys but you should bring things that make you comfortable.

 If you can, try to get one with long sleeves. Any t-shirt will do, but if you have thick or long hair, you may want to get a larger t-shirt.   T-shirts are made out of softer material than towels. Because they are so smooth, they snag on your hair less. This will help minimize rips, tears, and frizz.  The best time to add hair products to curly, kinky, or textured hair types is when the hair is still soaking wet.   If your hair is tangled, you can gently comb it at this point. Use a wide-toothed comb, and work in small sections, starting from the ends first. Never use a brush.  The arms and neck hole should be facing you, and the bottom hem should be facing away from you.  Try to get your hair as centered as possible. Your hair should be right between the shirt and the top of your head. You want your head very close to the shirt and your plopped hair, but not actually touching it.  Pinch the hem between your fingers, and lift it off the table or chair. Bring it over towards your neck, and let go. The hem should be covering the entire back and nape of your head.  Take the shirt by the shoulders and pull it up and against your forehead. Slide your hands along the sleeves, and hold them tightly.  Pull the arms towards the back of your head. They should cross right over the shirt hem. Tie them in a tight knot. If the sleeves are long enough, you can wrap them back around your head, and tie them in a knot right above your forehead.   The sleeves of the shirt will hold your shirt-turban in place. If the sleeves are too short, try securing them with a bobby pin or a safety pin.  This may take around 20 minutes, depending on how thick or long your hair is.Some people, however, like to plop-dry their hair before blow-drying it the rest of the way.  

find a t-shirt.  gently squeeze any extra moisture out of your hair and add in any hair products that you like to use.  spread a t-shirt out on a chair or table.  lean over the shirt and plop your hair down onto the fabric.  flip the bottom hem of the shirt onto the back of your head.  pull the front part of the shirt against your forehead.  wrap the arms of the shirt around your head and tie them in a knot.  wait for your hair to dry. 

 Gently scrunch your hair with a towel to remove excess water – try not to rough up your hair while towel drying it, since this is damaging. Apply a heat-protection cream product to your damp hair. Run a wide-toothed comb through it to evenly distribute the product from root to tip.  “Rough-dry” your hair, starting with the roots, to give your straight locks extra volume. Once the roots are dry, move on to blow drying the rest of your hair. Tousle it with your fingers and move sections of it around as you blow dry it.Don’t stop until your hair is completely dry.  Part your hair down the middle or along its usual part and divide it into two sections – one on each side of your head. Braid each section loosely. You can start your braids at the root or, for a slightly more “undone” look, start at the middle of your hair and braid it the rest of the way down.Secure each braided section with an elastic, leaving about an inch of unbraided hair at the ends. Tug gently at the ends to slightly loosen the braids.  Starting near the root or about halfway down (depending on where you want to waves to begin), clamp down on each braid with a ceramic flat iron. Press it tightly for a few seconds to create a wave. Release it, move down about an inch or two, and clamp down again.   Work your way down to the elastic on each section. Then move back up to the middle area and clamp down a few more times.  Remove the elastic and loosen both braids. Use a texturizing spray all over your hair, spraying as you finger-comb the sections. Scrunch gently it with your fingers and, if necessary, spray a little more of the texturizing product to set the look.   Use a volumizing powder or dry shampoo at the roots and tousle, if desired. This can provide a little more texture and body. 

shampoo and condition your hair as usual.  use your fingers to blow dry your hair.  divide your hair into two sections and braid it.  use a flat-iron to tightly press down on the braids.  undo the braids. 

 Do you want to consider taking up a career as a professional artist full time? Do you just want to take on this activity as a hobby part time? These are very important questions to ask yourself before you design your creative workroom. After this you'll need to consider what kind of creative work you'll be doing and what mediums (materials) you'll be using.  Tailor your arts and craft studio to your own needs and preferences. Some artist for example work best in total chaos and mess. Others work best in organization and peace.The steps in this article are really only a starting off point. You can always look through art studio sites, read magazines and books or watch videos and show on the subject to get ideas. It can also do good to chat with an artist who does similar art work or work that inspire you and chat with that person for tips advice and ideas. Different materials and procedures also require different settings. A paint project usually needs more space than a pastel or colored pencil. Colored pencils and pens don't require much space and can be carried out efficiently in a spare small room. If the majority of your art takes place outdoors or away from home, like on location, you might just need to room to store finished pieces and a nice way to tote materials to the location. Sometimes an artist just needs a retreat all their own from everybody or a safe place where the kids or pets don't have access to things like paints, sewing machines, and materials. Sometimes artists need to have all their supplies in one place. Sometimes an art studio is just a place to storage art and craft supplies.; , It's best not to try to make a shared part of the home or a major living area like the bedroom, kitchen an art craft studio. Toxic art materials if not handled correctly may end up contaminating the food, being eaten by accident or the artist burning that nights dinner. The living room or family activity can work if the artist can find quiet time away from the noise and distractions of other members. It can became really distracting and stressful for the artist and others the person lives with. Creating an art studio in the bedroom will cause problems not only with the sleeping partner but can cause sleeping problems for the artist. Also if you work at home or use the home office, crafts or arts can distract you from getting an important job done.  No spare room? You can also just invest in a nice modern craft station and/or easel and use that one place to use as an art studio. You can also further separate from the room with boundaries like houseplants, shelves or hanging fabric from the ceiling. Place it in the corner somewhere in a room. Just have a place to storage art supplies away when not in use.  You need to not only think about what materials you are using but other additional supplies you are going need and how are you going to store and work with them.  Painting for example can easily go well beyond paints as the career progresses. Where are easels, canvases, paper, or big bottles of gesso going to go? Also many painters also in time will want to use another technique or new material. Each new container of paint takes up space. If one takes up sewing there is a possibility that maybe another additional sewing machine that does a completely different function from the one that person already owns will need to be stored along with the first one . If you plan on photographing and blogging your artwork plan a place to store and keep the camera and computer. Another thing to consider is that some materials need to be stored under special conditions. Many glues and some paints can't be placed in cold temperatures, some fabrics can't be placed in full sunlight. Some drawing medias like pencils, chalks, pastels, charcoals will get brittle and dry in exposed locations. Others will melt in moist humid locations. There a many locking and air tight solutions in the food storage department of many stores that can easily solve many of these problems.  Kind in mind that some materials may have sticky vapors that will cling to walls and ceilings and form "blobs" that are impossible to get off.  Chalks, charcoals, and some kinds of pastels can get very dusty and coat anything it touches. Cover sensitive objects and surfaces with protective covers or place these delicate items in containers.   Many paints and glues give off fumes when your working with them and need to be used in a well-ventilated room such one with an open window. Also many craft materials can cause problems with health if ingested or if the material gets on the skin. Chalk dust can also cause sneezing and coughing.Some paint pigments are also toxic if ingested or absorbed through skin. When doing any art or crafts that require heat like using a hot glue gun, melting wax or wood burning make sure there is ventilation or cooling available so the room temperature is comfortable. This also includes working with machines that get hot while in operation. Anytime heat or electricity is involved have an fire extinguisher ready to go.  The space doesn't have to be huge but it should be adequate enough to do whatever it is you're doing.  Any artist can make masterpieces in any size room however the artist shouldn't have to bump their head or hands on the walls or ceiling. Consider whether a room is big enough for you to move around freely in as well as doing artistic activities.There should also be ample room to spread an adequate amount of your supplies out in one place instead of having to go back and forth getting supplies. The smaller the space, also the higher the concentration of fumes and smells coming from the paints in the room in most cases. Small rooms can also be noisy when using loud equipment. You can use small working places more efficiently by prioritizing your projects and with good placement of materials and workstations. When you are painting and don't have a lot pf room you may for instance get only the colors you are using for the step your doing now and as the paint dries up get your colors ready for the next step. Many awkward small nooks can hold many great storage or activity spots like storing the washing solution bucket and containing the splatters to one spot. A small room can also encourage an artist to leave the room more frequently and take a break. Big rooms can be overwhelming. The size of a room might make an artist take on too much or too big of a project because the artist feels it needs to be full. Also it's easy to get involved in too many different projects at one time. Bigger rooms also need more maintenance, lighting and cleaning.  This is not just the paints and brushes.But also the worktable, canvas, easel, paint thinner, palette and drop clothes. A crafts person will also need more than one kind of glue for different crafts. Safety equipment and first aid kits are great in case something goes wrong., Or at least consider going to a professional art store for more traditional versions. There are many relatively inexpensive worktables that are sleek and stylish made of tempered glass and steel. These often also will have drawers and pockets to easily place your pencils, paints etc. A glass table is also good for tracing things without the having to use projector all the time.Tables that tilt at angles are also good. Wood tables can also be a great choice with some of the features as above.   Get a workstation that's the correct height and width. You don't want to be crammed into a corner without ample room to stretch and move about nor should you have to stretch out of shape to reach supplies. Don't forget to have comfortable seating.  It's best to pick a nice clean white with no other colors.  Picking any other color may cause trouble. Dark colors will absorb lights and make the room darker which is not appropriate for most crafts. Picking any other color besides white will reflect that particular color unto the project affecting it's colors and your project will turn out different colors in a different room or outside. You can always decorate the other parts of the room with your favorite colors keeping the white dominant.  Excellent lighting is the fundamental of a well designed art studio.  Too much can be just as bad as too much. Poor lighting makes it difficult to do fine details in the work like adding the fine strands of hair to an oil painting or stitching on glass beads to a lace linen. Too much lighting causes glare (reflections off shiny items) and can make colors look faded. Both scenarios will cause eye problems and eyestrain. Choose your light color correctly. Light colors like paint will affect the tones and hues of your projects and materials. Not all light bulbs and colors are created equal. "Warm white" with yellow in it like candlelight or traditional lights can fade colors and make them look duller. "Cool white" with blue in it is said to be the artist light because electric companies claim it enhances the colors of the materials.This white color is also called daylight. There is also one called "pure white" which has no colors in it and it's the same color as bright white typing paper. The best option in light is a cool white or a good quality pure white. Consider cool LED bulbs for detail up close lighting. Incandescent, Fluorescent or Halogen lighting can get extremely hot and make it uncomfortable to work around. LED also perhaps won't hurt most materials sensitive to light. Natural light may or may not be good. The tones of light the sun gives to a room not only varies by the time of day but by many factors. Morning light has more blue in it than Dusk or Sunset light. The storm clouds and also pollution can color the sun an infinite array of colors.Also the colors of things around the window can influence colors in the room.   Keep materials organized in appropriate containers. Categorize your materials by brand, type, material or by project. There many specific containers for specific materials. Some storage containers also have locks to keep unwanted guests or curious pets and kids out of potentially dangerous materials. Don't just dump materials in a huge box or plastic bin. It's practically creating a pile of mess in a box that one has to dig about like a pirate searching for treasure. Don't also put loads of different tiny boxes in one huge container.It's much better to keep lots of smaller boxes on shelves. Save the big bin for larger items.This also will save on straining the muscles and hands. Think beyond the craft stores when it comes to storage. Many times a hardware or tool shop will have storage solutions often at lower prices and have more possibilities. Tool boxes and chest can provide roomier storage than a tiny plastic case. Pegboards, wine racks, hangers for clothes, can become great solutions for awkward items. Many common place containers that are dark colored like iodine glass bottles after rinsing off can help keep sunlight sensitive liquids from being damaged. A great way to store things like colored pencils, markers, pens, crochet hooks, is to create a carousel storage compartment or buy one. Get a lazy Susan at any home decorator shop or cake stand that rotates and use plastic storage cylinders or food cans properly rinsed and cleaned or cups and mugs and place your items in there. Old CD and DVD spindle cases can also be used for many storage solutions.If the compartments of the carousel are not permanently built in there's a great advantage of flexibility and more options.       Consider using vertical shelving for small lightweight items. Flat storage up against the walls will save on valuable floor place. Don't put heavy items on high shelves. Heavy items should be placed on lower shelves and at shorter distances from your workstation.   Consider having a portable form of a workstation or table. Whether it has doilies (wheels) or one of those tables that fold up or let the user change the dimensions of the table. Invest in adjustable shelving systems. These are better options than more traditional shelves because as your creative taste change you can change the space as well. Also if the room has to become a child's room or you need a guest room it easily be converted into another different place. Give your studio a nice place for lounging. Sometimes you might want to look at the works you created with a cup of tea, play on your Android while waiting for the paint to dry or use your studio as a restful retreat to catnap.  It's important to have a place to keep samples of materials and all your little notes. It's important for any creative person to have access to color or fabric swatches, inspirations, notes, tutorials.  Keep your color swatches, fabric swatches in real not digital form. Even the best computer screen can not display all colors accurately nor can it display finishes or textures. There is no such thing as "feel-a-vision" yet. Also the display settings on any computer can vary causing colors to look different among different screens. Keep you color swatches in a sheltered place. Some materials are easily faded by exposure to moisture, dust, air or the sun. This also prevents paint or glue from spilling on those precious swatches. Use the computer and it's many ways of storage to store things like detailed instructions, store information, magazine articles, model numbers. Many manuals are also downloadable via .pdf format online. (option) Looking at what you achieved can be awarding and inspire you to be more creative. If your home lacks room to display your finished pieces use your own craft room as a display room as well. This is your place to be yourself in purest form. Don't be afraid to change the display as needed or as you wish. Display your finished works in your studio as you wish.  Be sure to protect painted or stained projects with the appropriate sealer that is waterproof. Also store these things in appropriate containers. Place paper works in an acid free album or frame with acid free mounting inside. Acid in some framing materials (also fabrics) will cause them to age quickly and become yellowed, discolored or have fine cracks in the material. Store your finished projects in appropriate containers to ensure that they will last for a long time.  Making messes is inevitable in an art craft studio and it's best to keep surfaces safe and clean as possible. If the room or floor is not really in good shape or you're into the spill design trend you can skip this step.  When doing a potential messy craft or painting cover the surfaces of the work station with a drop cloth. Use weather tarp, drop clothes or even rags to keep your surfaces clean and usable. When using things like glitter or beads that can be messy getting all over place, keep these medias in a container such as a paper plate and keep a properly sized funnel so they don't roll or fall all over the place. Keep the container being used in another container rather than on the main surface glitter and beads can also be returned to the original container saving inventory and money. This also is a great way to keep crumbly messes to a minimum. Have anything thing you need handy for cleaning up the media in case of a spill. Water washable material can only needs a nicely sized pail of water or access to a sink.   Don't buy what you really don't need! Many of the "useful" items like, the colored pencil storage case or that carrying tote for brushes will sometimes just get in the way. Also it's not really necessary to buy huge containers of paint, or multitudes of the same color if your doing only a small project. Paints and glues will loss their quality very often when first opened. It's also easy to forget which identical glue container is already opened or brand new. Tame those cords, ribbons, wires, threads and chains. It's best to keep long items on a reel like a thread is on a spool. If these are not storage correctly prepare yourself for a jungle of tangled mess and tripping hazards. Try to also keep those electric wires or air gun hoses under wraps with wire organizational products. You might want to use portable, chargeable, battery operated equipment to minimize cord hassles. Do not keep old catalogs from art stores after a year or two! Prices and products change very often. Many hobby and craft magazines have their articles online somewhere on the web or are often revamps of older articles and information written somewhere else or on a video site like Youtube. These subscriptions can get annoying and costly for the artist in the form of mental and spacial clutter. Before you subscribe to or buy that book or magazine make sure it's not available in some other more convenient, neater form. Also many magazines only describe the project in the magazine and then the reader has to go online to get the instructions. Place paper in a container that keeps it from folding/rolling up the edges (becoming dog eared).  Good labeling that is easy to spot and read will help keep you organized and prevent costly mistakes caused by confusion. If you are a visual person who keeps organization better with pictures use photos or drawings on the storage container. Keep different categories of things in different color containers in a color code system or simply put all similar colors in it's own container or section of the container.  Also if you use more than one of anything that looks very similar like unlabeled crochet hooks, make sure to label them or use a color code system with a color key written down. A color key tells what each color means.Green can be for synthetic brushes and blue for natural brushes. Good labeling also help you seperate your identical paper scissors from your fabric scissors if necessary. Nail enamel or a thin colored tape works great for this purpose. Do not put any important thing of the studio in a nondescript , unlabeled or poorly labeled bag or box! It's too easy to assume such a container has nothing important in it and later realize that that box or bag going to the trash plant has your new ordered paper or finished project you love so much! Avoid this mishap by investing in clear containers or bags and labeling things in them with a fade proof permanent marker or label. At least you'll be able to see what's inside.  Oil and/or clean machines and utensils regularly. Tape the ends of delicate ribbons or use fray prevention glue to keep them looking their best. Close glue and paint projects to increase shelf life. Protect delicate and sensitive materials from their enemies. When not in use cover sewing machines, glue guns etc to protect them from dust and grime., You'll want your masterpieces to last forever so you can proudly cherish them for years to come.  Be sure to protect painted or stained projects with the appropriate sealer that is waterproof. Place paper works in an acid free album or frame with acid free mounting inside. Acid in some framing materials (also fabrics) will cause them to age quickly and become yellowed, discolored or have fine cracks in the material.  

consider how involved in your arts and crafts activities you are going to be.  look for an unused room if possible.  consider what tools, media and the conditions these materials need to be stored in.  consider how messy your craft will be.  consider the hazards of the materials you'll be using.  consider how much space is needed to when working on projects.  get the proper equipment for the crafts activity your doing.  browse the web for workstations specially designed arts and craft centers.  keep the walls colorless if possible.  find the correct lighting.  look into storage options.  keep the design of the room flexible in case of changes.  maintain a place to keep memos.  maintain a place to display your finished projects.  protect surfaces when using messy materials.  get into the habit of keeping clutter out of your craft room.  label, label, label!,  protect the equipment and materials and keep them operational.  protect your finished projects. 

 Get into a college with a photography or photojournalism program by getting good grades in high school and participating in as many photography and journalism extracurriculars as possible. Get involved in a school newspaper, a photography club or group, an internship with a newspaper, or an assistant position with a local freelancer., Get a college degree in a photography related field, ideally photojournalism, to provide you with the skills and the background needed for most entry-level photojournalism jobs. It’s important that you get both the technical and artistic skills of photography as well as a good understanding of news and journalism, though you don’t necessarily need a degree to make it in the industry.   If photojournalism isn’t an available major at your college, try majoring in photography and minoring in journalism or communications, or vice versa. If it’s been awhile since you graduated or took photos for a class or job, try taking an individual course or workshop to refresh your memory and skills.  In classes or on your own, learn and perfect the basic skills that most photojournalism job descriptions require. Focus on areas in both photography and journalism, such as:   Electronic photojournalism Visual communication Visual editing News reporting Interviewing skills Journalism ethics, Invest in professional quality camera equipment, including a good camera body, a wide angle lens, and a telephoto lens as your basics. Do some research to find used gear or older models with the same main features as the newest ones. You may have access to cameras and accessories through the job, but you look more established and attractive as a job candidate if you come prepared with all of your equipment.  Check calendars for local events and attend them, tag along with a photojournalist on an assignment, or simply walk around your town and city to practice shooting events that you see take place. Try to imagine telling the whole story of the event with just your photos. Practice writing captions or a small news brief to accompany the photos, and show them to a seasoned photojournalist for feedback if you can., Set yourself apart from other amateur photographers by focusing on people more than the objects or overall scenery of an event. Be bold and don’t be afraid to approach people to get their facial expressions and a more personal take on the event., Keep up with advances in new camera models, lenses, and other photography equipment. Research the advantages and disadvantages of new features and consider saving up for new models or testing one out by renting or borrowing it from another photographer.  

prepare for college.  go to school for photojournalism.  focus on job-specific skills.  get quality equipment.  attend events and practice.  focus on people.  stay up to date. 

 An unused toothbrush works well for this. Run the soapy brush or sponge under warm water. If you are using a sponge, squeeze out the excess water. If you are in a pinch, you can use a clean rag or folded paper towel.  Using the brush or sponge, wipe down the cuff and tubing, making sure that no water enters the tubing. If there are stains, use a scrub brush or a toothbrush to dislodge dirt. Make sure to vigorously scour the velcro in particular, as dirt and germs can linger within it. Cuffs are resilient; you do not have to be gentle as you clean. Aggressive scrubbing will guarantee a cleaner cuff.  Be extremely careful that no water enters the tubing. You can plug the tube with a paper towel to ensure this. You can, however, rinse the cuff entirely. After rinsing, pat both the tubing and the cuff dry with a clean towel.  The cuff should appear wet after spraying. Leave the alcohol or disinfectant to sit for ten minutes before patting dry to ensure that all bacteria are killed.   Alternately, you can mix 1 tsp. (5 ml) of bleach with 2 cups (473 ml) of water and pour it into the bottle. Shake the bottle and spray the mixture onto the cuff and tubing.  The cuffs should hang on a clothesline or similar apparatus that suspends the cuff without it touching other materials. The outer and inner cuff as well as the velcro should be completely dry before re-use. Once dry, you can reinsert the tubing.  

put several drops of liquid dish detergent onto a brush or sponge.  scrub both sides of the cuff, tubing and bulb completely.  rinse the cuff and tubing with running warm water.  spray both sides of the cuff with rubbing alcohol.you should spray the tubing and bulb as well.  allow the cuff and tubing to air-dry before use. 

 To move a file from the home folder into the documents folder, you first need to use the "cd" command to move into your home folder:       cd ~    ; , Now that you are in the folder you want to copy files from, choose which file you want to copy and run the "cp" command to copy it to the folder you want it copied to. So if the file you want copied to the documents folder is called myFile.txt, the command to use is...       cp myFile.txt documents      , The best way to do this is by running these commands and finding your file in the list.     cd documents ls      

move to the directory you want to copy your files from.  use the copy command to move your files to the directory you want.  move to the folder you copied the file to and check if it copied correctly. 

 If you already have a credit or debit card, go get it. If not, use cash to buy a pre-loaded debit card from a convenience store or pharmacy, or buy a gift card from the theater.   To avoid suspicion, don’t buy the gift card from the theater the same day you try to see the movie.  Purchase your ticket online or at an automated kiosk at the theater.Deal with one less person who may wonder how old you are. Remember that once you’re inside, you'll still have to present your ticket to a staff member who will direct you to the particular theater in which your movie’s playing. Wear clothes and accessories that are appropriate for the age you’re pretending to be.  Once you have your ticket, wait until a few other people approach the staff member who's collecting tickets. The busier it is, the more likely the staff member will wave people through without glancing at anything but the theater number printed on their tickets. If there’s no line, dawdle by the concession stand or pretend to text somebody on your phone until a line builds up.  

use plastic.  avoid human contact.  wait for the line to back up. 

 Slide tackles should be a relatively rare element of your game. A defender should only go to the ground if there is no possibility of defending the play while standing up. If the offensive player is going around you and you have no support, it might be appropriate to go to the ground to stop an offensive charge and give your support a chance to catch up. A good slide tackle usually takes the ball out of bounds, changes possession, or otherwise clears it.   Making an unsafe slide tackle warrants an automatic red card and ejection from the came, with the possibility of further punishments from the league or your coaches. Only use the maneuver if absolutely necessary.  The best time for a slide tackle is when you and your opponent are running parallel, toward the ball, and that you're going to lose possession very quickly if you don't make a move now. If you can't get a foot on the ball while you're in a standing position, and you're about to lose ground, it's the perfect time for a tackle.   Never make a slide tackle from behind. Tackles from behind or from head-on are very dangerous and the possibility of a penalty is high. It's possible to do it correctly in some situations, like if you're both going for the ball but neither is in possession, but not recommended unless you're sure you'll be able to get to the ball first.  The ideal moment for a slide tackle is just after the player in possession has kicked the ball, creating separation between that player's body and the ball itself. That will give you the most room to maneuver and get your foot in the way. Keep your eye on the ball and watch absolutely nothing but the ball while you slide through to tackle. A good slide tackle should be focused on nothing but getting the ball out of the way., Before you decide to take it to the ground, do a quick double check of your emotions. You don't slide tackle a player, you slide tackle the ball to get your team control. Targeting a player will get you ejected and possibly kicked off the team.  Lead with your dominant foot–the foot you use to kick with–and hook your leg into the ball, making contact with ball first and foremost, and sliding as softly as possible onto the ground, through the ball, and across your opponent's path.   A proper slide tackle is just like a baseball slide. You shouldn't leap up into the air and come crashing down on your hip, or you risk hurting yourself. Drop the shoulder closest to the ball and slide with your leg extended. Never slow down before taking it to the ground. You should accelerate into a slide to make sure that your leg follows through with the motion, clearing the ball, not just falling flat.  The legality of the slide tackle depends totally on whether or not you contact the ball first. If you clear the ball, then your opponent trips over your and lands face-first on the ground, it's legal. If you clip your opponent's shin and then clear the ball, you're going to get at least a yellow card warning, and probably worse.  Never slide tackle unless you're wearing form-fitting shin guards of the proper size. You're throwing your leg out there to be tripped over, potentially, or stepped on by a pair of cleats, making it essential that you guard yourself. Shin guards might not be the most comfortable things to play in, but if you're going to be taking it to the ground, they're absolutely essential.  

only go to the ground as a last-ditch defense.  run parallel to the player in possession.  watch the ball closely and wait until you see separation.  check your emotions at the door.  slide into the tackle, don't jump into the tackle.  make sure you get the ball.  protect yourself. 

 Many different things can be used as decoys. Dead blackbirds, cardboard silhouettes, or my personal favorite, dove decoys spray painted black.  Blackbirds prefer to stay close to each other, so the decoys should be pretty close. Put the decoys in an open place where passing blackbirds can see them.  

make decoys.  arrange the decoys in a realistic way. 

 Determine if dating at this time in your life is worth it. This is always a good idea, even if you aren’t dating out of your age group. Make sure that you are going into a relationship with the idea that you may stay in this relationship for a long time, even forever. It will take time, money, and other resources to make your relationship work.; , It makes sense to get to know them. With an age difference, you are more likely to enjoy different things and think different ways. Get to know the person and find out all of their likes and dislikes; what makes them tick.  This seems a little strange, but it’s helpful to clear the air. If one or both of you has a problem with the age difference, but you still want to try the relationship out, go ahead. Often times, you will forget about the age difference and enjoy each other’s company.  In social settings, mean-spirited people will often call the older person a “cradle robber” or some other such thing. More often than not, they are jealous of the fun and happiness the two of you share.   At first, you will try to ignore people like this. When that gets tiresome or impossible, don’t try to reason with them or explain why you are in the relationship. You don’t owe anyone an explanation. Simply say something like, “You’re right, we are a few years apart, but I don’t think I’ve ever been happier.” You’ll be surprised how quickly that quiets busy-bodies.  The first stages of dating involve learning how to be the best of friends. Do that! Beyond getting to know each other (step 2), learn about each other and how to know what the other is feeling. Learn body language, changes in voice, etc.  

take stock of your priorities.  get to know your significant other.  talk about your ages.  learn how to deal with people who point out your age difference.  enjoy one another as you would someone who is your age. 

 When someone offers you baby name advice or opinions that you don’t want, simply thank them and then progress the conversation onto a new subject.For example, if someone suggests a name, simply say to then, “I’ll keep that one in mind, thank you. So, how was your day at work?” If someone offers input on a name you've already chosen, let them know, "I'll consider your advice. Now, how was your day?" Try to shift the conversation toward the other person to avoid any further unsolicited baby advice.  Perhaps there is a name that is significant in your family. Or perhaps there are certain social or cultural connotations that accompany certain names in your area. Consider who is offering the advice and why, and be willing to listen, even if you already have a name you like.Know that listening does not mean you need to apply the advice. However, listening politely may make others feel like they were heard this time and keep them from pressuring you in the future. Understand that this advice may come out of love or from genuine concern. Know that it is likely not meant to hurt, shame, or otherwise insult you.  If someone is looking to advise you or give you an opinion, shift the subject from baby names to something you actually want advice or an opinion on. For example, you may want to ask them if they know of any good pediatricians in the area or affordable but safe car seats.   When you are talking with the person, try turning the subject by saying, “I’m still considering baby names right now, but do you know of a good daycare program for young children?”  

say “thank you.” often, taking the high road is the easiest way to shut down the conversation and still keep people on your good side.  consider the source.  ask for other advice. 

 The scene all started with the band Throbbing Gristle forming their own label, Industrial Records, for a new genre of extremely weird experimental electronic music. For some Rivet Heads, this is the only “real” Industrial music - bands like SPK and The Leather Nun which spawned from this scene of the early 80s.  The modern Rivethead may listen to Darkwave bands resembling a heavier form of EBM (Wumpscut, Skinny Puppy), or even the commercial “Industrial Metal” bands (Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, KMFDM).  It is also undeniable that Sc-Fi movies such as The Matrix have inspired the look of many Rivet Heads - a lot of them will refuse to remove their trenchcoats even in the sweatiest clubs.  

rivet heads, or industrial goths, often do not consider themselves “goths,” although their preferred music and fashion can be found in the same shops and they’ll happily go to goth clubs.  however, in the modern era the industrial scene has come to resemble a dark, rough, dystopian version of the cyber scene.  industrial fashion is somewhat like cyber in its futuristic appearance but is generally more monochrome, less polished and often has a military influence. 

 While the camera may be hidden, the lens can only be camouflaged.  Locate possible places that hidden cameras can be found in a personal residence or business. Start looking in logical places such as in the bedroom, in the living room, or especially near valuable items.        Common items to have video cameras hidden in them include books, smoke detectors, desk plants, house plants, tissue boxes, stuffed teddy bears and electrical outlets.       Check for cameras in less conspicuous items as well. These can include a gym bag, a purse, DVD cases, air filter equipment, eyeglasses, lava lamps, buttons or a Phillips screwdriver.       Look for a little hole, no bigger than this "O," somewhere on the side facing the room.       Look for mirrors that seem to have no reason to be where they are. It may be next to impossible to spot the camera, but you can be alert to the possibility.      ; ,  Search for areas that would offer the best field of vision. This is generally higher up on buildings or in open areas without obstructions.       Look for glass or plastic domes, particularly tinted ones. Public cameras are generally found behind protective shields. Chances are if it's facing the room, and is either mirrored or translucent, there's a camera behind it.        

spot tell-tale signs.  watch for and avoid hidden cameras in public places. 

 Interpleader actions, such as this, are very detailed and far reaching, encompassing multiple types of law. So many different things are likely to impact your case, and judges have great latitude for discretion. If you can afford a local attorney who knows the types of things your judge favors and disfavors, it would be best to hire one. See How to Find a Good Attorney. If you cannot afford a full-service attorney, some attorneys provide “unbundled services”. Unbundled services include:   Preparing documents Giving you legal advice only Teaching you the law as it applies to your case Coaching you through the legal process; , Ideally, you will want to challenge the beneficiary designation prior to the insurance company paying out the claim. The insurance company cannot decide who to pay the claim to, but if there is a formal dispute as to the beneficiary, they will pay the policy out to a trust held by the courts until the dispute is settled. It will likely be much more difficult to collect insurance proceeds from an improperly named beneficiary who has already been paid.If the insurance company pays to the named beneficiary, you will need to file suit against that individual. If the individual has already spent the proceeds of the policy, you may have difficulty collecting. If the individual has no assets, you may not be able to collect at all.  In some states, laws provide that insurance proceeds must go to particular people. For instance many states require a spouse be designated as beneficiary unless the spouse consents in writing to a different beneficiary designation. You can usually find a link to your state laws on the websites for the governor, the highest court, and/or the legislature. Review the statutes regarding insurance and probate., In many divorce and child custody situations, courts order support paying persons to name recipient persons as beneficiaries to life insurance policies to ensure those support payments continue in case of the payor’s death. These commonly include: Child support payments are guaranteed by a life insurance policy naming either the person with custody or a trust for the child as the beneficiary. Spousal support payments are guaranteed by a life insurance policy naming the former spouse as the beneficiary. Installment payments involving assets awarded in property settlements may be guaranteed by a life insurance policy payable to the spouse who was awarded the clear asset.  Insurance companies are required to pay to named beneficiaries, but if that beneficiary is not clear, they cannot pay until they learn who is meant by that designation. Some examples are:Beneficiary is designated as “spouse”, but deceased is no longer married. Beneficiary is designated as “child”, but there is now more than one child. Beneficiary is designated by name to former spouse, but state law requires designation of current spouse.  In some cases, courts will set aside beneficiary designations if they were made by virtue of fraud, undue influence, or mental incompetency. These are difficult, but not impossible, to prove.Fraud can be when a person is told they are signing something other than what they are actually signing or when a person relies on untrue information to persuade them to sign the beneficiary designation. Undue influence is when someone induces the insured to sign the beneficiary designation under excessive threats, flatter or other coercive behaviors. If a beneficiary is acting as a caregiver, power-of-attorney, or other position of trust, undue influence is presumed, but can be rebutted. Mental incompetence is usually defined as the inability to reasonably understand the nature of the document being signed. This definition will vary between states. A person with dementia or other illnesses may be presumed as incompetent, but it is deemed as of the time the document was signed.  To obtain court documents, such as child support orders with life insurance provisions, contact the clerk of the court that issued the order. Be prepared to provide the following information and pay a fee for certified copies:The full names of the parties to the case, such as the parents of the child. The estimated date of the order. The case number, names of attorneys, names of judges or other identifying information if the names are common in that area.  If you need birth certificates or marriage licenses, contact the Department of Vital Statistics or similar agency in the state where the event occurred. You may need to provide proof of a legal right to obtain the document and pay a fee. This proof may include:Copy of drivers license. Copy of passport. Copy of court order allowing you to obtain access to the document.  Especially for claims of fraud, mental incompetence, or undue influence, witnesses will be necessary. You will need to be able to prove specific instances of conduct showing these behaviors. When talking with potential witnesses:Ask them to be specific in particular instances where certain behaviors occurred (such as approximately how many times Aunt Sally forgot where she lived or how the current beneficiary refused to allow Aunt Sally to spend time with her previously beloved niece or nephew). Ask them to write a statement of things they observed about the situation. Prepare them to potentially testify on your behalf.  Unless the insurance company is formally informed in writing of a challenge to the beneficiary, they must pay to the named beneficiary. Once the beneficiary is officially challenged, the insurance company will file what is called an interpleader action with the courts. With this filing:The insurance company will deposit the proceeds of the policy with the court. The insurance company will name and serve all parties believed to claim some legal right to the proceeds. The insurance company will then withdraw from the case, letting the court decide who gets the proceeds.  When you receive notice of the interpleader action, you must take certain actions within a specified period of time. Consider hiring an attorney for these and further legal actions.You must file your answer with the court and serve it on the other claimants within the period of time specified on the summons or citation you received, usually 21 to 45 days or receiving the petition and summons or citation. Your answer must state the all of the reasons you believe you are entitled to the proceeds. Your answer must be signed by you or your attorney.  Most courts will require at least one attempt at mediation or settlement conference. Because the cost of litigating these actions is so high, some cases settle prior to going to trial. Consider whether it is cost-effective to pursue through trial based on the amount of the insurance proceeds. If it is a small policy, the cost of pursuing the case to trial could be more than you stand to gain from the insurance policy.Mediation is when a neutral third party attempts to help the claimants compromise into a settlement. Settlement conference is when the claimants and their attorneys attempt to compromise into a settlement without the assistance of the neutral third party.  

consider contacting an attorney.  recognize the time sensitivity of the action.  check your state laws.  look for court orders.  look for ambiguities.  look for evidence of fraud or undue influence.  contact the clerk of courts.  contact the department of vital statistics.  talk to potential witnesses.  notify the life insurance company.  respond to the interpleader action.  consider settling. 

 Renaissance people spend time balancing the needs of their mind with those of their body. Stay healthy by exercising regularly. If you’ve never exercised before, now’s a great time to start!

 Because breach of warranty claims are based in contract law, you must have a contractual relationship to the plaintiff.   Unlike negligence or strict liability claims, which can be brought by anyone who happened to be injured by your product, the plaintiff must have a specific legal relationship – called "privity" – with you to sue you for breach of warranty.Privity typically is established by a written contract, although the precise definition of privity varies among states. Usually, the plaintiff must be the person who purchased the product directly from you.Even if your product was defective, you can successfully defend against a breach of warranty claim by proving the plaintiff was not a party to the contract under which the product was sold., When you entered into a contract with the plaintiff, you sold a product designed to fit a particular purpose.   There are two basic warranties that courts infer are included in every contract: an implied warranty of merchantability and a warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. Much like strict liability claims, breach of these warranties hinges on the plaintiff proving that the product was defective.Essentially, the plaintiff told you what he or she needed to do, and you provided a product that would fulfill that need. There is an implied understanding that the product you sold the plaintiff would function and meet the plaintiff's specifications.To succeed on a breach of warranty claim, therefore, the plaintiff must prove that she told you her particular needs and you promised to meet those needs, but the product you provided failed to live up to that promise., As with strict liability, you have a defense against a breach of warranty claim if the plaintiff altered your product or used it for an unintended purpose.  If the plaintiff made substantial changes to your product after he or she received it, you may not be liable for her injuries.As in strict liability, you must show the original design for your product, how the plaintiff modified it, and that those modifications caused the plaintiff's injuries.Common examples of a plaintiff's modification that can be used as a defense include removal of safety guards intended to prevent injury, if the plaintiff's injury is the same as the injuries the guard was designed to prevent.You also can defend yourself in a product liability lawsuit based on breach of warranty by proving that the plaintiff got injured while using your product in a way it was never intended.As with strict liability claims, the misuse must be unforeseeable, such as if the plaintiff used a meat slicer as a diaper-changing table.  The contract the plaintiff signed may include provisions on advance notice of a potential breach of warranty claim.   Most contracts use boilerplate language to address the implied warranty of merchantability and the warranty of fitness. These clauses typically require written notice of a breach of warranty claim within a certain period of time after the injury.If the plaintiff fails to comply with the notice provisions in the contract, he or she is considered in breach of the contract itself, and will not prevail in the lawsuit over this defense.Many warranty provisions also limit the amount of damages the plaintiff can recover in a breach of warranty action, typically allowing only repair or replacement of the defective product.If the plaintiff's contract includes such a limitation, you should compare it to the damages the plaintiff is demanding in the lawsuit.  

evaluate your relationship to the plaintiff.  analyze the plaintiff's use of the product in light of the contract.  determine whether the plaintiff modified or misused your product.  check the contract's notice requirements. 

 Before you depart for the airport, prepare for the possibility of a delay and make sure to pack some things to keep you busy and comfortable should the inevitable happen. For example, a tablet computer, a book, a portable music player, a handheld games console, or maybe a puzzle book. A watch is also a must. Children can become extremely impatient waiting around, keep them amused and entertained with a coloring book, or possibly a story book and don't forget their favourite toy!; , Being able to freshen up when trapped in a crowded airport can really make a difference and lift your mood.

Get some food for a frail woman who might have trouble walking down the long corridor. Offer to let someone use your cellphone or your laptop to make contact with worried relatives or friends. Helping others will allow you to stop obsessing over your own miserable situation and will make the time go a little bit faster.  You can just stare out the large airport windows and watch planes taxi and take off. You can even bring a camera and take pictures.  There will be lots to see in the airport, so why not go have a wander round? A nice long walk can pass as much time as you need. You may spot some interesting sights on the way as well. For example, in some airports you can find out about aircraft from the past, such as the world famous Concorde.  There are thousands of magazines and books for sale at most airports. This is a good time to open your mind and learn something new.  Most airport shops will carry puzzle books. Anything from word search to sudoku can keep you pleasantly amused for quite a while, as well as exercising your mind.  Your portable media player can be a life saver.

There will be a wide variety of dishes available, from a traditional meal to a quick takeaway. You are also likely to find some more exotic foods available, so why not be daring and give them a try? Or, if you enjoy the atmosphere of a pub, you can sit down and relax with a meal and drink. For the people who need a drink, there will be plenty of places to find one. If you'd like to get a morning energy buzz at any time of day, see if they airport has a food location that serves coffee, such as Dunkin Donuts. Vending machines and dedicated bars are the best place to buy. However, prepared to spend quite a bit more than you normally would for any given dish.  Most airports have at least one shop, but some major, international ones have multiple gift shops. Shopping inside an airport can also make you more relaxed for your flight. You can buy small little gifts for family and friends, or buy something for yourself.  Internet is usually available in all airports, although it can come at a heavy price, although some airports, such as the Boston Logan International Airport will offer it for free. So, if you have some money, the Internet can make the time fly by. Why not check your emails, or play some games? You could even contribute to wikiHow! If you have children, allow them to play some games as well, as this will keep them entertained for a little while longer, and keep them relaxed before the flight., Some international airports now offer massages, manicures, pedicures, and other treats. For a decent price you will be able to feel fresh and relaxed for your flight. Another treat is to try to buy yourself a place in an airport lounge, where you can spend your time doing things you enjoy, such as playing snooker, having a drink at a bar, or going for a dip in a jacuzzi. Although it can be pricey, if you can afford it, it will make your day.  Talking is also another great time killer. Thousands of people use an airport every day, so you are definitely going to find someone to start a conversation with.

This can also start conversations with other people, who may join in your conversation.  If you are in the airport because you have just completed a vacation, and maybe you met interesting people or took a tour of some interesting facilities or visited a beautiful beach. You probably learned a lot and have many details fresh in your mind. Why not use the opportunity to make some detailed notes about your experiences? You will never remember them as clearly as you do right now. If you are with some of your traveling companions, this airport downtime will present you with a nice opportunity to talk with them about the details of the trip as you are writing. When you get home you can add your notes to a journal, or a scrapbook, or perhaps blog about them. But more importantly, using your airport time to write will help you decompress or debrief about your trip.  Take along a small knitting, crocheting, or other needlework project. Have a photocopy of the pattern, or use a pattern that is easily memorized. Most airlines allow knitting needles and crochet hooks on their planes. Teach your child to knit, crochet, embroider, or make other simple yarn projects.  Take a deck of cards to the airport and play poker or other card games with your fellow friends or passengers (Always works). 

think ahead.  be sure to pack a toothbrush, toothpaste and a facecloth.  help others.  look out the window.  go for a walk.  read.  work a crossword or sudoku puzzle.  listen to music or watch a video.  getting hungry and thirsty?,  shop around.  go online.  treat yourself.  talk to others.  go through the travel plan.  get it on paper.  occupy your fingers.  play a card game.  bring a handheld games console, making sure the batteries are charged.  

 If you have planned your restaurant outing in advance, monitor your blood glucose levels carefully throughout the day and eat wisely and within general diabetic dietary restrictions.  Check your glucose levels in the restroom or outside the restaurant if you prefer, but be sure to keep track of your blood sugar levels before and after the main meal.

eat mindfully the day of your outing.  don’t be embarrassed to excuse yourself to check blood sugar. 

 You can save multiple gallons of water daily by shutting off running water when performing certain daily tasks. Examples of ways you can use less water is to take quicker showers, and turn off the faucet while shaving or brushing your teeth.; , These types of shower and faucet accessories will allow you to save thousands of gallons of water per year because they restrict heavy water-flow. In most cases, installation will require you to unscrew the shower- or faucet-head using a wrench, and screwing the new shower- or faucet-head onto the nozzle.  A dual-flush toilet has 2 handles for flushing different levels of water; whereas a low-flow toilet can save approximately 9,000 gallons (34,068 liters) of water per year.  

use less running water in your bathroom.  install low-flow shower-heads and faucet aerators.  have a dual-flush or low-flow toilet installed in your home. 

 If you’re just building up a fitness regimen, you may not have a clear idea of exactly what you want to achieve. You may not even know what your body is capable of. That’s fine; even simply wanting to be stronger is a solid starting point. In general, it’s healthier and more effective to focus on strength you want to build or activities you want to perform, as opposed to a certain look.   Some sample goals include: running a 5K without stopping, touching your toes, lifting your own weight above your head, and doing the splits. Some fitness programs and diets even discourage you from weighing or measuring yourself as you change your routines.Getting bogged down in the look of your body can distract you from what it can do. Write down your goals in a notebook and set an alarm to look at them in three months, six months, or a year.; , Building a new routine can be tricky: it takes about two months for a new habit to become second nature.Still, you want to set goals that don’t feel too distant. Many fitness experts recommend a three month timeframe: a season is long enough that you can accomplish a great deal, but not so lengthy that you feel like you’ll never see the end of it.Some races and events, like marathons, have a somewhat standardized recommended training schedule.It’s okay to have smaller mini-goals. For instance, you may plan to weight up five pounds on the rowing machine every two weeks. Remember that working out every day is a goal in and of itself.  Every body is different, and everyone’s goals are too. Because of this, there’s rarely one-size-fits-all fitness advice. You are powerfully positioned to learn, because you know yourself and your aims better than anyone does. Put some time in to learn what types of exercise will suit you and which ones you like. There are plenty of resources out there to help.   Though it can’t replace an instructor who watches you in person, the Internet has many reliable fonts of fitness information. Start with the President's Council on Fitness page. If you aren't ready to venture outside with your fitness routine, there are plenty of workouts on YouTube that you can do at home with no equipment. Try Blogilates or Fitness Blender.  If you have the option, do trial workouts at different gyms until you find a vibe you like. Even better, most gyms offer orientations, where an expert can show you how to use different types of equipment to safely maximize your workout. There are many criteria for selecting the perfect gym, including:   Is it easy for you to get to? Is it usually full? Can you easily access equipment? Do you feel comfortable around the other members?, Group classes offer the benefits of in-person instruction for beginners without the pressures of personal training. Plus, the regular schedules and presence of other fitness enthusiasts can help you stay motivated.If you're trying to figure out what you like, try a service like Groupon or ClassPass. These offer a discounted pack of classes, so you can figure out if you're really into hot yoga or spinning before committing to them.  It’s admirable to want to push yourself, but you can’t turn from a couch potato into a track star in a week. Exhaustion is real, and burnout can negatively impact your ability to reach your goals.Work your way slowly up to your exercise goals. For example, if you want to run, start out by walking at a brisk pace until your body feels comfortable and ready for jogging or running.   Walk up and down flights of stairs instead of taking elevators or escalators, and park your automobile in the farthest spot away from your destination to increase your daily activity in the beginning. If you’re too tired for a full workout one day but still want to move, take a long walk or do house or yard work.  

select your fitness goals.  pick a realistic timeframe.  seek out expert advice.  try out a gym.  experiment with group classes.  pace yourself. 

 It is important to start with a clean slate. Wash your face with a gentle cleanser and then follow with a lightweight moisturizer. If you will be spending time out in the sun, then use a moisturizer that contains sunscreen.You can also try a primer. Primers can help to even out your skin and make your foundation look better after you put it on. Try using a matte primer if you want a shine-free look. Just apply the primer to your whole face before you apply your foundation. Using a special serum, such as an eye cream or fine line serum, can also be helpful.Try choosing a special serum that targets an area that tends to give you trouble.; , If you have dark circles under your eyes, then apply a few vertical steaks of concealer over them and then blend them well.Your concealer should be a shade or two lighter than your foundation and using one that has a yellow tone to it will also help to cover dark circles better.         You can use a concealer brush or use a concealer that comes in stick form. Don’t worry if it looks really bright. You can blend and even out the color when you apply your foundation.  Next, apply foundation to your entire face to give yourself even coverage. Make sure that you blend you foundation evenly, especially around your hairline and in the creases around your nose and chin.         You can also use special tools to make blending your foundation easier, such as a blending sponge, a foundation brush, or a buffing brush.Make sure that you choose a foundation that suits your needs. Foundation is available in light coverage formulas and full coverage formulas. You can also get foundation that is moisturizing, matte finish, or oil-free., After you have finished applying your foundation, you might notice a few pimples that are still visible through the makeup. In this case, you can apply a little extra concealer to cover these pimples.         Pat on the concealer with a small makeup brush and then use one of your blending tools to blend the makeup in. If you want, you can also blend a few different concealer or foundation colors to create a custom color.  If you want some bronze highlights, then you can apply a few strategic streaks of a darker color foundation. Choose a foundation that is a few shades darker than your foundation and apply streaks down the sides of your nose, the hollow areas of your cheeks, and just above your eyebrows.         Use one of your blending tools to blend in the darker color foundation until your skin looks sun-kissed.  To ensure that your makeup will stay flawless all day long, apply a dusting of translucent powder over your makeup. This will also help to soak up any extra oil and provide a matte look.         Use a large fluffy brush to apply your powder. Apply the powder all over your face.  

cleanse and moisturize your skin.  cover dark circles with concealer.  apply your foundation.  apply extra concealer over pimples.  blend in a darker shade for a sun-kissed look.  set your makeup with powder. 

 If the child has hit you several times, try to identify what might be causing this behavior. Do they always hit at a particular time or during a particular event? Has something recently changed in the family that might be making the child upset?   If the child is hitting you to get attention, try ignoring the action. This might teach them that hitting you will not get the attention that they want. If you suspect that your child is learning this behavior from other children, you should try to remove them from that peer group. Find a different daycare or play group so that they are not influenced by this bad behavior.Some children may hit because they are frustrated that they cannot communicate properly. Try to teach your child certain phrases or actions to allow them to demonstrate what they want.Try asking yourself some questions to see if you can identify a trigger. For example, you can as yourself questions like “Why are they acting this way?” “Is there one particular person he/she is displaying this type of aggressive behavior to?” “If it is just one particular person, is it because of frustration, anger, or over excitement?” and “Are there any particular patterns or routines you've noticed before, during, or after these occurrences?”  , When your child calms down after a tantrum, acknowledge their good behavior. Make it a habit to compliment your child when they have acted correctly.For example, if your child has a problem and tells you about it, you can say, “Good job using your words.” If your child apologizes to you for hitting you, you can say, “Thank you for saying you’re sorry. I understand how you feel, and I love you very much.”  , Children learn by example. If they see you hitting or screaming at other people, they will learn that these actions are acceptable behavior in public. Act towards other people the way you want your child to act towards you.Use a calm, even voice when disagreeing with people. This will show your child how to act during a disagreement. If you did something wrong, apologize. Say, “I’m sorry for that. I know what I did was wrong.”  , Hitting or spanking your child will only teach them that physical violence is an appropriate way to act. It will not discourage them from hitting, and it may even influence them to become more physical as they grow older., Certain circumstances may cause your child to act aggressively, so you may need to avoid these situations. For example, if your child only acts aggressively at play groups, then it might be best to avoid taking your child to play groups. Or, if you child becomes aggressive when they watch certain tv shows or play certain video games, then it might be best to prevent your child from engaging in those activities.   Try to engage your child in low-key activities to help calm them. For example, you could sit and listen to some calming music with your child or encourage them to color.  It may take time for your child to develop the ability to control their emotions, so it is important to acknowledge their efforts. For example, if you notice your child making an effort to control their anger, then praise them for their efforts.   Try saying something like, “I am proud of you for…” Keep in mind that young children have a hard time controlling their emotions, so it is important to acknowledge their efforts and encourage them.  If the child keeps hitting or starts escalating their behavior—through biting, kicking, or throwing things you may want to consult your pediatrician. They may be able to recommend a child behavioral specialist who can identify the underlying problem and help you fix it. Some things to watch out for include:   Following ongoing patterns of defiant, disobedient, or hostile behavior towards any authority figures. Frequently or easily losing their temper. Being deliberate with their actions or engaging in activities that annoy others. Constantly expressing annoyance, or being chronically sensitive. Having ongoing anger and resentment that they cannot control alone or with the help of a parent. Constantly acting spiteful and vindictive, and is always argumentative.  

identify their trigger.  praise good behavior.  model appropriate behavior for your child.  avoid physical punishment.  be aware of your child’s limitations.  appreciate your child’s efforts.  take the child to see a behavioral specialist. 

 If you already made one and stored it in the fridge, remove it so it can warm up to room temperature. If not, make a cold brew as described, but stop short of straining the liquid. Let the rice sit in the water instead and cover the bowl., Allow the rice water to ferment anywhere from 12 to 48 hours. Uncover and smell the contents periodically. Once it begins to smell sour, consider it fermented. Expect the time needed for this to vary depending on the exact temperature, plus whether or not the liquid has been strained.An unstrained mixture should ferment in 12 to 24 hours. Strained liquid will take between 24 and 48 hours. Higher room temperatures will reduce the amount of time needed.  First, strain the liquid if you haven’t already done so. Transfer the liquid to a pot or saucepan. Raise the heat to medium-high. Bring the water to a boil to cease the fermentation.Boiling the water after fermentation is often recommended, but not strictly required.  If you intend to use it right away, allow the water to cool first to avoid scalding. Otherwise, transfer it to a sealable container. Store in the refrigerator.Expect fermented water to pack a punch. Dilute the fermented rice water with plain warm water as desired when you use it. 

make a cold brew.  let the rice water sit at room temperature.  boil the water.  use or store your rice water. 

 This will not kill living fleas, but it will shut down their ability to reproduce. This is useful considering fleas can have up to a trillion offspring in a lifespan.   Look for an outdoor insect growth regulator you can spray around your yard.  This will kill fleas and other household pests that are found outdoors.  Fleas love to hang out in grassy areas, so a well maintained lawn will not be terribly attractive to them.  

treat your outdoor space with an insect growth regulator.  mix a concentrate of esfenvalerate with some water, and spray it on your yard.  keep your grass short. 

 There are some situations when simply saying “no” might put you in danger. This can include being mugged or held hostage, being alone with someone who is heavily intoxicated, or being in a romantic situation that becomes aggressive. Many of the same principles of saying “no” respectfully still apply. For example you should understand what the other person wants and why they want it. This might help you reason with them., De-escalation is not about being right or wrong. It is about being in control by staying calm and creating a calmness in the other person. Do not criticize or berate them, but talk calmly. One way to bring most people down is to ask them to help you understand how they feel. Allow them to work through “how” and “why” they feel that way while you listen attentively, without interrupting or challenging them.Note that you will most likely not be calm. Breath slowly and steadily to help keep yourself calm., You are much less likely to be in danger if you are in a crowd of people. If you feel threatened, try to move to a more crowded area. If you cannot move the interaction easily, shout and flail to draw attention to yourself if you must., If de-escalation isn’t working and you feel like you can get away, run! Do not try to fight if you can avoid it. This keeps you in a dangerous situation longer and can really anger the other person., If no other option exists and you are in danger, you will have to fight back. It is important to remember the goal is not to win the fight, but to get away. Go for vulnerable areas such as the nose, throat, and groin. If you do manage to hurt an assailant, get away as fast as you can. Go straight to the police.In romantic situations where a clear no is being ignored and you cannot walk away, use the open palm of your hand to hit the offender in the nose with an upward motion. Do not use a fist - an open hand is more effective. Regardless of what Hollywood would have you think, this will not kill them. It will give him a bloody (and possibly broken) nose. Do not resort to violence unless it is absolutely necessary.  

evaluate your surroundings.  de-escalate the situation.  draw attention to yourself.  run if you can get away.  fight back only if you must. 

 Play the CSR Racing video there to get an idea of what to expect in the game.; , This game is structured in tiers from Tier-1 to Tier-5. You advance through the tiers by winning races against some of the best opponents. You start the game racing in Tier-1 so you have to use a Tier-1 car. When you qualify for Tier-2 you have to buy a Tier-2 car. The Audi A1 is an example of a Tier-1 car. You can't use the Audi A1 in Tier-2 competition and so on. There is some overlapping though, for instance, you can use the Audi A1 in Tier-2 in a limited way. It is limited to RR Racing, to build cash in Tier-2 until you're ready to purchase the tier-2 car that you want to use for advancing to Tier-3.  There are 3 levels of difficulty in RR, Rookie, Amateur, and Pro. The best way to build cash in RR is to select the difficulty level to suit your level of winning, or to match your cars level of winning. Of course, you can start upgrading your car to win more times per race, and build even more cash.  One has a 1/4 mile race and another has a 1/2 mile race. Some cars will do best on a longer track, but another car will like the short track better. This depends mostly on the how you upgrade your car and how fast you are at shifting with proper use of the throttle.  There is the temptation to buy more cars than you need but you can only use one car, for the most part, in one tier, and you can't sell your cars in this game. Your agent will randomly offer you a different deal, like 70% off on a new car. When she makes that offer on the car you want, accept it, it's a good deal. But don't buy 6 cars in the first tier, they will be just sitting unused, and you may only be able to upgrade the one used for competition.  When you begin the game in the first tier, you are given a car to get you started. Usually it's a Dodge Dart and you won't have any money at first. You have to use that car to start building up some cash to buy the car you really want. The best way to build cash is to select "Regulation RR" play which will build up the most money the easiest way. It won't take very long to win $10,000 or $20,000 to purchase your new car. , You don't actually drive the car in this game. You only have to shift gears and control throttle at precisely the right moments to win some races. You should be able to build up enough cash to purchase upgrades for your current car, allowing you to win more per race. Then you can advance through this tier and purchase the car you want to drive for the next tier.    , You start out with a stock car and the only way to win anything and go on to the next tier is to upgrade the car with horsepower and speed increasing items like new engines, turbo chargers, gear boxes, and even new tires for better traction. You will get pretty good at this in time.  At some point you will have to defeat a Pitt Crew and their boss to advance to the next tier. The best way to handle this competition is to race one or two trials with the first crew member. If you lose, don't keep trying. You will really need to upgrade your car. You can purchase upgrades to the next upgrade level, then go back to try again. Repeat this until you can progress through the entire crew. At the same time, you can always go back to RR and get more money for more new upgrades.  Tier-5 is the last tier (for now). It is also the toughest to win. You could win all tiers by using nitrous but you should be able to win without it, with determination, and clever upgrade selections. The toughest pit boss to beat is Tier-5 Boss; Errol.

 Men and women tend to wear different types of shorts when playing volleyball. Women’s shorts are tighter and shorter while men’s shorts are longer and looser.   Women typically wear spandex shorts. These have a four-inch inseam and resemble biking shorts.Men wear baggy shorts that reach just above the knee. These resemble basketball shorts.  Jerseys are standard in competitive volleyball. Your team will likely provide you a jersey. Jerseys must be a solid color, and the libero must be wearing a contrasting color to the rest of the team.Women’s jerseys are tight-fitting with short sleeves. Make sure that your shirt is snug but that you can still move your arms. Try stretching and rotating your arms when you try yours on to see how well you can move. Men wear looser jerseys with no sleeves. Make sure yours is not so loose that it can get caught in the net.  Volleyball shoes have special rubber soles that give them extra traction on the court. Two popular brands of volleyball shoes are Asics and Mizuno.Prices for good shoes range from $70 to $150.  Pick knee pads that fit you well and that cover your entire knee. The sleeve of the kneepad should be between 5 and 10 inches.More advanced players may want a shorter sleeve for maximum flexibility while newer players will want longer sleeves to increase their protection.  

wear shorts.  put on a jersey.  invest in a pair of volleyball shoes.  put on knee pads. 

 Every resource has their designated set of job description allotted. Identify the skills from the explained job description. Example- One of the job description for a CNC operator is: - He/ She needs to maintain the machine daily after completing their shift. Skill Identified: - Knowledge of 5S( A concept for maintaining cleanliness). Competency identified:- Awareness towards safety and hazard.; , Repeat the above-mentioned process department wise. Talk to managers and resources. Sum up all the JDS and list down every possible skill that contribute towards an effective task performance.  Fix the categories apt for your organization. This may depend on your organizational industry, product, strength and client base too. Example- Technical, Behavioral and Processes; are some of the category that are common to almost all.  Use your common sense and assign every single skill set into its suitable category. Example. “Machining” is a skill under Technical parameter. However, “5S” (the concept) will go to Processes and “Behavioral safety” can be fixed at Behavioral parameter.  As the name suggests, it is the explained dictionary of every skill that we have mentioned above. We have to explain level wise description of every skill. You can either choose a three - level or four – level dictionary. Level 1 being lowest, Level 2 is Needs improvement, level 3 being Average and level 4 is good. If the highest level is level 5, try to mark accordingly.  If your dictionary has level 1 being lowest, every single addition to its level is commensurate with the difficulty/ perfection level to perform the task. And Level 4 is the epitome for perfection. Assigning resources to these levels depicts their present caliber and knowledge level in that particular skill. Example- If I assign Mr. Gorge (Works at manufacturing industry as a CNC operator for past 2 years) at level 3 in “Machining” skill, then According to the dictionary, I am stating that he is having an average level of understanding for this skill.  One resource needs to map twice against every single skill. As it is a tool to enhance the skill and get the appropriate training hence, Mr. Gorge needs to map again for knowing what is the desired skill level for him to perform the machining task most efficiently. It will vary according to designation, years of work experience and educational qualification. Example- If Mr, Gorge is a diploma holder and is working at junior level associate, his required level of competency would be level 4 (On a scale of 1-5). And if he is a graduate and is at mid-level associate, the desired level of competency would be much high as at level 5.  Gap between Actual and Desired is the source of Training need identification. Comprehend the gap and fix it with appropriate training and seminar scheduling.  The measurement can be done in two phases. One, just after the training, with a questionnaire and on-job performance. And Two, After six months of training, imparted. The second phase of measurement is aimed to testify the retention level.  Competency mapping is a cyclic process. If, after two-phased evaluation, the resource has improved, then the actual skill level is enhanced and so the desired one too.  It is a very useful tool for objective appraisals.  

skill identification from the job description.  club all the skills across organization.  frame skill categories.  devote skills into categories.  prepare a skill dictionary.  understand the levels.  mapping is comparison.  identify the gap and translate it.  measure the effectiveness.  map the resource again.  link the evaluation with performance appraisal schemes. 

 Even if the bunny will be confined to one room, he will get out sooner or later, so it's best to do the entire house. Potential threats include:   Electric cables, especially when attached to heavy things (e.g., kettles, irons, etc) or if they are dangling in their path.       Bleach, pesticide and other chemicals       Small cracks, holes and gaps which your bunny may get stuck in. They can get into surprisingly small spaces and are drawn to dark hideaways. Remember that they are burrowing PREY species.      ; , Put it out of reach (preferably somewhere high up, rather than simply in a cupboard) cover it up with something your rabbit cannot chew through, or get rid of it all together. If none of these are possible, keep the room strictly off-bounds for the rabbit until you have a solution.   Electric wires and cables are dangerous; unplug and store them, or cover them with plastic sleeves. Don't choose cord covers/protectors that are scented, or have spaces in them.  You probably have furniture or items made from wood, metal, plastic, and stuff that your bunny can chew on that is not edible but may seem attractive to the rabbit. To avoid letting your bunny chew on these things is to put a pen or some kind of crate around it. This way he/she can't get through to it., Something as innocent as a piece of string can potentially kill your rabbit if he finds it lying on the floor. Remember, rabbits are curious and love to chew.  You are essentially rabbit-proofing your family as well. Make children in particular aware of the rules. Make sure these are included:   Do not feed junk food to the rabbit       Do not feed too much fruit to the rabbit       Do not pick up the rabbit without warning       Do not squeeze, hit, poke or shout at the rabbit       Do not leave chemicals, junk food, rubbish or string/yarn lying in the rabbit's reach. This is especially true for chocolate, which is very appealing to them and is poisonous for bunnies.  These can be used to possibly distract the bunny from chewing things., Bunnies do not litter train like cats do, but you can put a litter box where they have had a pee and they will use it, especially if you wipe the inside bottom of the pan with the paper towel you just wiped the pee up with (clean the original spot with an enzyme odor-removing cleaner). They key off of both scent and location. Once they are using the box regularly, it can be gradually moved to a more convenient nearby location, if necessary. Some bunnies can be trained to poop only in their litter box but others cannot. This is not usually a problem, since their pellets are usually dry and easily swept up.  Do not use clumping clay litter for bunnies. It can cause digestive problems.  Some bunnies can be trained to the "come" command. If they can, do so, since this makes them much easier to find/ catch/ remove from behind the washing machine... Be sure to always reward a bunny well for responding promptly and enthusiastically to this command, since it can be a life saver. 

go around the entire house on your knees, or even better your belly which puts your eyes at bunny level, looking for potential threats.  find a way to deal with every threat.  place a crate around chewable things.  tidy up.  make a list of rules for the whole family to follow.  spread suitable rabbit toys around the room/house.  provide a safe spot for their bathroom needs.  train your bunny to come, if possible. 

 You could get they're before everyone else does and change before any of them come in and change very quickly., If you go fast enough, none of them will even notice you were there. 

go quickly.  speed change while they're there. 

 You may think that that can of soda at dinnertime is sufficient time for the effects to wear off, but science says it's not. It can last in your system for up to twelve hours.Heck, that means avoiding it at lunch! But at least science isn't taking away your morning cup of joe.   In case it wasn't implied clearly enough, having loads of sugar isn't great for your sleepiness either. Even if you avoid the soda, stay away from the overly sugary juices and caffeine free but not sugar free beverages, too.  Not including the other obvious reasons you should quit smoking, nicotine can also interrupt your sleep schedule -- it's a stimulant. What's more, you may wake up in the middle of the night with a nicotine craving. That's no good for your sleep cycles, either., Whether that means going for your lunch in the park or just throwing open all the curtains, make sure your brain gets stimulated by enough daylight. The sun is a natural cue to your brain that it's time to wake up. Need an excuse to walk the dog? There you go!   Remove your sunglasses in the morning for an instant, "WOAH, I'M AWAKE" feeling. The more your eyes can soak in, the better. And if you've got a case of the winter woes, think of investing in a light therapy box. It causes your body to release melatonin the same way the sun does.That being said, you want a room that's dark at night. You may find investing in a good set of light-eliminating curtains blocks out that street light and cuts down on your falling-asleep time. Just make sure to throw 'em open in the morning!  , That doesn't mean you have to turn into an Olympic athlete -- just 30 minutes a day of aerobic exercise (the heart-pounding kind) can help you sleep better.Break it up into smaller chunks if that's better for your schedule; you'll still reap the benefits.   If possible, work out in the late afternoon, but before dinner. If you work out within 4 hours of going to bed, it could just rev you up., When you go to bed, you want to neither be hungry or stuffed -- either feeling can keep you awake. So if you tend to eat your dinner late, this is even more important. The alternative is going to bed later, but you don't want that either!   Rich, fatty foods are harder for the stomach to digest. The heavier the food, the more conscious of it you'll be, making it harder to fall asleep. And be wary of spicy foods -- heartburn is just as unpleasant at night as it is during the day, Spending the day frustrated, nervous, irritated or just plain stressed will seep into your night routine. If you have troubles sleeping at night, could this be a cause? What could you do to reduce it?    Manage your stress by taking time to do yoga, a relaxing hobby, or just five minutes to yourself each day to focus on your breathing. If it's a bigger issue, consider seeking professional help.  There are a variety of problems that are sleep-related, and they're not always crystal clear. If you set up a routine and follow this page, but still can't sleep, you may be best in a doctor's hands.   If you have headaches in the morning or are constantly sleepy, that's a red flag. If you act out your dreams or get tingling sensations, those are signs, too. Anything out of the normal that disrupts your ability to sleep how you'd like may be grounds for asking a professional. Don't take yourself lightly -- your health is of the utmost importance.        

avoid caffeine.  quit smoking.  get enough light in your day.  exercise.  keep dinner light.  check your stress at the door.  know when to see a doctor. 

 Where is the firing coming from? To find out, use the minimap––it tells you where your opponents are even without the UAV. If you see a chunk of your teammates on the left side of the minimap, chances are the enemy is on the other side. Use this knowledge to your advantage and situate yourself to be in prime position to get the first shot.; , Much like driving you've got to pay attention to the entirety of your peripheral vision. Watch for dark corners and turns that would allow an enemy to get the jump on you.  People don't look up. You can just shoot down on them. You should put a claymore on the stairs (or however you got up) so if they try to get revenge, they blow up.  

know what is going on around you.  scan the field.  get above the enemy. 

 Sandpaper can be found at hardware stores and many supermarkets. Hold the sandpaper and begin to rub your shoes with it. Apply some pressure as you rub. Don’t rub over the entire surface of your shoes with the sandpaper. Only go over the parts where you would like to see marks., A pumice block is typically used to remove dry skin, but it is also a great way to scuff up your boots. Hold the boot in one hand and the pumice block in the other hand. Rub the pumice block back and forth over one part of your boot. Move on to another part of your boot when you are satisfied with the marks. Repeat with the second boot.You can find a pumice block online, at a beauty supply store, or at many supermarkets.  A wire brush is good to use for lighter, wispier scuff marks. Hold the boot in one hand and the wire brush in the other. Go over the boot in a back-and-forth motion. It may take a couple of minutes to achieve noticeable scuff marks. Move on to other parts of the boot and then repeat on the second boot., Scouring pads are made out of steel and wool and are typically used to clean tough surfaces, which makes them great for making scuff marks. Use the scouring pad to get larger, more noticeable marks. Simply rub the scouring pad over the part of the shoe where you would like to see marks—like on the toe. It may take some time to achieve the desired scuff marks. 

go over the shoes with medium grain sandpaper.  use a pumice block.  rub with a wire brush.  use a scouring pad. 

 If you have not already downloaded it on your device, then do so.  If your Netflix account has multiple profiles, make sure to click your own when the "Who's watching?" screen comes up.  If you have a specific title in mind, click on "search" in the upper right hand part of the screen and type in what you are looking for. If you don't have a specific title in mind, browse through all that Netflix has to offer using whichever means you wish. Once you have located which title you want to add to your queue, proceed to the next step.  A small menu will open up showing information about the movie/TV show. On the right of the menu, there will be a box with the words "Add to My List."  , If the title has been successfully added to your queue, the "Add to My List" button will change to read "Remove From My List," and you will be able to locate it in your queue.  

open the netflix app.  log into your netflix account.  find the movie or tv show you want to add to your queue.  select the movie/tv show.  click "add to my list." 

 A great way to build a good neighborhood is to start with your home. Basic maintenance is a great way of creating the impression that your neighborhood is a good place to live. If you don’t maintain your home, you’ll send the impression that you don’t care about your neighborhood or your neighbors.   Paint your home (as needed). Make necessary repairs to your home. This includes rotten wood, broken shutters, and more. While some repairs might be expensive, basic maintenance (paint touchups and replacing wood rot) can be inexpensive if you do it yourself.; , In many places, the idea of a good neighborhood is tied to positive and desirable aesthetics. One of the most important aspects of this is the way people’s lawns and yards look. If you want to make your neighborhood a better place, you should put some effort into tending to your lawn and yard.   Cut your grass regularly. This might mean cutting every week or two depending on the season and your region. Remove fallen limbs, sticks, and other organic debris from your yard. Sod or seed your yard, if you lack grass., If you are serious about building a better neighborhood, you should make sure that you aren’t accumulating junk in your yard. Storing junk in sight of your neighbors can alienate them and create a negative vibe in your neighborhood. This is because you’re likely to decrease property values and give the impression that your neighborhood is a less nice place than it really is.   Don’t store your collection of classic project cars in your front yard or where your neighbors can see them. If you are serious about your fifteen project cars, put up a privacy fence to protect them and hide them from sight. Make sure trash makes it to the curb on trash pick-up day. Avoid storing excess furniture, Christmas decorations, your lawn mower, or other collectables on your porch., One of the best ways to create a good neighborhood is to make sure that you don’t create any problems for your neighbors. After all, if you create problems for your neighbors, they’ll probably resent you and won’t want to interact with you. This will help establish a negative vibe in your neighborhood.   Don’t let your animals roam freely. Free ranging dogs may chase children on bikes, runners, or otherwise cause problems. Free roaming cats could kill birds, squirrels, and more. Avoid blocking the path to your neighbor’s driveway. This could include not putting trash on the curb next to your neighbor’s driveway, or parking your car (or visitors’ cars) in certain spots., Noise complaints and noise problems are one of the biggest issues in many neighborhoods. As a result, if you want to better your neighborhood, limit the noise you produce.   Monitor your dog (or other pets) and make sure they don’t bark or otherwise disturb your neighbors on a continual basis. If you have parties, make sure to limit the noise you produce and turn all music off at a reasonable hour. In many cases, eleven or midnight on the weekend is a good time to turn your music off. Nine or ten at night is a good time to turn it off on a week day. Try not to blast the radio too loud as you’re washing your car. Avoid sawing wood or cutting down a tree at inopportune times. Home improvement projects are best done between the hours of 10 and 5 on weekends. 

maintain your home.  tend to your lawn and yard.  avoid accumulating junk in your yard.  don't create problems for your neighbors.  limit the noise you produce. 

 If you perceive your ankles to be unusually thick (especially if a sudden change has occurred), then schedule an appointment with your family physician. Your doctor will examine your feet, ankles and legs, ask questions about your family history, diet and lifestyle, and maybe even take your blood pressure or send you for a blood test (to check cholesterol levels). Your doctor will determine if your cankles have a relatively benign cause (such as weight gain or edema from too much dietary salt) or if they are related to a health problem (such as poor circulation or heart disease). However, your family doctor is not a foot or circulatory specialist, so you may need a referral to another doctor with more specialized training.   Genetically, some women have naturally larger bones / ankle joints and thicker calf muscles, which cannot be remedied without invasive surgery. Obesity obviously involves fat accumulation around the body, but the face, abdomen, buttocks and thighs are much more common destinations for fat deposit than the ankles.; , If your family doctor thinks your cankles are related to a blood flow problem such as venous insufficiency (a vein condition that causes blood and other fluid to accumulate around the ankle and foot) then you may be referred to a vascular surgeon for a consult.If a hormonal problem is suspected (such as low insulin levels, which is indicative of diabetes), then you may be sent to an endocrinologist. If a heart problem is suspected (such as congestive heart failure), then a cardiologist might be the most appropriate doctor to see and treat your problem.   Vascular ultrasound is a painless procedure that allows a doctor to assess the function of the veins and arteries of your lower leg. Podiatrists are foot specialists who may also be helpful in diagnosing ankle problems.  Make sure you get the doctor to clearly explain the diagnosis, especially the cause (if possible), and provide you with various treatment options for your cankles. If it's determined that you have no health issues and your larger-than-normal ankles are simply due to genetics and body type, then focus more on body acceptance and overall health, while being less concerned about something as frivolous as the aesthetics of your ankles. Body shapes and sizes can be changed somewhat, but only within well-defined limits.   Muscle fiber types and bone structure are inherited characteristics, so loosing weight and working out your leg muscles may have very little impact on your cankles.Research the various causes of thick ankles on the internet. It will give you ideas of potential treatments you can do at home, but always stick to reputable medical / health sites.  Walking, jogging and cycling are all good exercises that force your lower leg muscles to contract. If you have poor circulation in your legs due to faulty or leaky valves within your veins (a common cause of venous insufficiency), then exercising your lower legs muscles can act like a second heart because they will squeeze the veins and help return the venous blood back into circulation.If you decide to jog, then run on softer surfaces (such as grass) and wear well-cushioned shoes or else you increase the risk of damaging or spraining your ankles and contributing to your problem. Stretching your ankles and lower legs may also promote better blood and lymph flow.  Fluid accumulation (edema) around the ankles can also be caused by peripheral arterial disease, which occurs when small arteries carrying blood to the legs slowly become narrowed or blocked from plaque accumulation inside the arterial walls -- a disease process called atherosclerosis.Without proper blood flow, the tissues of the foot and ankle don't get enough oxygen and other nutrients and become damaged. With time, the feet and ankles may become inflamed. Taking blood thinners (usually a prescription medication) prevents the plaque build-up in arteries and promotes better blood flow and blood pressure.Commonly recommended blood thinners include aspirin and warfarin (Coumadin). Arterial plaque contains cholesterol, so maintaining a healthy blood cholesterol level may help prevent atherosclerosis.  Compression stockings are available online, at medical supply stores, or maybe your medical specialist will give some for free if you're diagnosed with a vascular disease. Compression stockings provide support to muscles and blood vessels, which reduces edema / swelling and promotes better circulation.   Putting your feet up while resting, watching TV or sitting at the computer will help with blood flow from your legs due to reducing the effect of gravity. Laying down is even better. Soaking your feet and ankles in a warm Epsom salt bath can significantly reduce pain and swelling.  If your cankles are caused by obesity, then shedding some weight should also help to slim your ankles eventually, as well as improving your overall health status (such as a reduced risk of heart attack and stroke).Depending on your level of obesity, you may want to start with exercises that don't put too much pressure on your ankles and other leg joints, such as swimming or cycling. Once you bring your weight down to safer levels, add weight-bearing exercises such as walking or bouncing on a mini trampoline, which will also promote better blood circulation within your feet and legs.   Exercise regimens for obese people should be supervised by a healthcare professional. Fat loss usually occurs from the face and abdomen initially, so be patient for the fat to be burned off from around your ankles. Consider doing some leg exercises that increase the definition of your calves (such as stair climbing) without making the muscles bigger. The enhanced muscle definition may make your ankles appear slimmer.  In addition to cardiovascular exercise, focus on reducing the number of calories you consume on a daily basis. Most people who are relatively sedentary only require about 2,000 calories per day to maintain their body processes and have enough energy for mild levels of exercise.Reducing your calorie intake by 500 calories daily will result in about 4 pounds of fat tissue loss per month.   Salads made with leafy greens and fresh vegetables are excellent choices for weight loss because they are low-calorie, high in nutrients and relatively bulky (high in fiber), so they fill up your stomach. Just remember to go easy on the salad dressing. Drinking lots of water is great for weight loss because it's calorie free and helps to curb your appetite.  If you're having trouble losing the fat deposits around your ankle, then schedule a consultation with a vascular or cosmetic surgeon in order to discuss fat removal via liposuction.Being invasive, surgery should be your last option to combat your cankles, not your first choice because of the potential convenience. In addition to liposuction, the surgeon may be able to shave or remodel the bones and muscles of the lower calf and ankle.   Make sure you understand all the risks of undergoing surgery, such as allergic reactions to anesthesia, infections and heavy blood loss.  Diets high in salt tend to make tissues look puffy because the sodium within salt pulls the water from the cells into the surrounding interstitial spaces, creating a type of swelling called edema.The face, hands and feet / ankles are common areas affected by high-salt diets. Most processed foods are high in sodium, so focus more on fresh meats and produce.   Canned tomato sauces, salsas, crackers and pickled veggies are particularly high in sodium. Your daily sodium intake should be between 1,500 mg and 2,300 mg.A low-sodium diet recommended by many doctors is called the DASH diet., Pregnancy not only involves weight gain that may negatively impact your ankles, but also periods of poor circulation and changes in hormonal levels, which often promotes fluid retention in the lower legs. So if you're worried about your cankles during pregnancy, then you can certainly reduce your sodium intake, but simply wait until you give birth and see if your ankles go back to normal size.   Going on moderately paced walks and always raising your legs when you sit will help reduce edema in your ankles while you're pregnant. Realize also that edema can come and go with a woman's menstrual cycle., Chronic alcohol intake can injury the pancreas and liver because ethanol is relatively toxic. A damaged liver doesn't work properly making enzymes and processing amino acids, which leads to edema (water retention) in the body.Alcohol is also fairly high in sugar-based calories (especially when combined with soda pop) without containing any other nutrients, which promotes weight gain. Beer can be particularly problematic because some brands are also high in sodium.   Consider switching to red wine, which is healthier for your blood vessels.Avoid eating the peanuts and pretzels that are served at some bars, as both are very high in salt.  Long pants will cover your cankles and slim your legs at the same time. Wide-legged styles are best, as these don’t hug your ankles. Try to avoid skinny jeans and cropped styles that cut off right above the ankle.Long dresses and skirts also have a slimming effect. Just make sure they cut off at the ankle, not above it.  High-waisted bottoms lengthen your legs, resulting in a slimmer-looking ankle. Try high-waisted pants or a long, high-waisted skirt., Chunky heels can make large ankles look slimmer. Stay away from stilettos, which are small and thin, making your ankles look larger in comparison., Ankle straps will only call attention to your cankles. Instead, pick shoes that cover your ankles, like high boots, or shoes with pointed toes, which help elongate your legs., If you don’t want to give up cropped pants or sandals with ankle straps, try accessorizing. Bold accessories, like handbags, sunglasses, and jewelry, will draw eyes upward and away from your cankles. 

schedule an appointment with your doctor.  see a specialist about your ankles.  get an accurate diagnosis and understand the cause.  exercise your legs more.  consider taking blood thinners.  wear compression stockings.  lose weight by exercising.  lose weight by decreasing your caloric consumption.  consider liposuction.  reduce your dietary salt intake.  be patient if you're pregnant.  avoid consuming excessive alcohol, especially beer.  wear long, wide-legged pants.  choose high-waisted bottoms.  pick chunky heels.  avoid shoes with ankle straps.  draw attention elsewhere with accessories. 

 While it's okay to be bold, women will not take well to you being pushy. Pay attention to how she's responding. If she seems curt or closed off, back off. Continuing to flirt at this point will only bother her.If a woman is not returning your gaze or smile and doing things like crossing her arms during conversation, she's not receptive to your flirting.  While touch is a great means of flirting, it's also a delicate matter. Everyone has their own space bubble and some women don't like to be touched right away. If she recoils from your touch, or gets quiet or uncomfortable afterwards, you have invaded her personal space. Go back to other flirtatious tactics and refrain from touching her again., It's great to compliment a woman in a respectful fashion, but steer clear from saying anything that could come off as sleazy. Stick to complimenting things like her smile, laugh, and eyes, and avoid overtly talking about her body.This is especially important if you don't know a woman. A woman may feel very uncomfortable if a strange guy is talking overtly about her body.  

don't get pushy.  watch her reactions closely when touching her.  avoid being too overt when complimenting her physical appearance. 

 Use a mild, gentle cleanser and lukewarm to wash your face every evening.Gently pat your face dry with a clean washcloth.Avoid scrubbing your face dry, which can damage your skin.   If you have problems with acne, consider washing with a product that contains salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide to manage it. If you wear makeup, remember to always remove it every night. Gently dab at the inner corners of your eyes with a dampened washcloth to remove any debris.; , Use a moisturizer that contains a minimum of SPF15 sunscreen to protect your skin from sun damage. Choose a moisturizer that matches your skin type – moisturizer products usually cater to oily, dry or combination skin.   After each shower, apply lotion to your body to avoid cracked skin. Pay special attention to the knees and elbows, which tend to get very dry.  Tweeze any stray eyebrows that you see, especially in between your brows. If you shave your face, do it carefully. Always use shaving cream, which protects and lubricates your face. Use a sharp razor that has no debris lodged between the blades. Always shave in the same direction your facial hair grows.For those who don’t shave their face, inspect the hair above your upper lip – do you see any dark or long fringe? If so, you can manage that by bleaching the hair or removing it entirely with a depilatory.  Before you leave the house, check to make sure your nasal passages are clear. Always blow your nose when you get out of the shower. The warm water of the shower will loosen any fluid or mucus that might be trapped in your sinuses, making post-shower the ideal time to flush them out.   If you’ve recently been ill or if you have allergies, consider flushing out your sinuses with a saline solution using a neti pot.Avoid picking your nose.  

wash your face twice per day.in the morning, a water rinse will suffice for most skin types.  apply moisturizer with sunscreen daily.after cleansing, moisturize your face.  manage your facial hair.  check your nasal passages. 

 Nobody wants to hang out with some poser scene kid. Listen to the music while following the steps below.   If you like metal, listen to Death-core/Metal-core bands like Bring Me the Horizon, Suicide Silence, Chelsea Grin, Asking Alexandria, and the Acacia Strain. If you're more interested in pop, listen to something still electronic-based and danceable but edgier than a soccer mom would listen to like Panic At The Disco, Hellogoodbye, Lady Gaga (Yes, really) and deadmau5 if you like Dubstep. Want something mellow/soft? Try indie like Death Cab For Cutie, Ellie Goulding, LIGHTS, and Foxtrot. If you're looking for something in between, try post-hardcore & Screamo. Examples include A Sky lit Drive, Sky Eats Airplane, Escape the Fate, Breathe Carolina (electronic), Attack Attack, etc. A good website to go on to find bands is www. taste-kid.com. It has you type in a band you already like, and it'll give you even more suggestions.; , The most important part of the scene look is the hair. You can get away with any clothes as long as your hair is perfect. The typical scene hairstyle is unisex and works for all lengths/hair types. Just make sure you have short layers at the top and side bangs. Cut them yourself if you can. Girls can also have straight bangs. Don't forget to get your hair thinned out.  Straighten your hair completely flat. If your hair seems frizzy, add shine serum. If you're a boy with longer hair, stop here because you're done. Everyone else, grab those teasing combs. Only tease the uppermost shortest layers if you have short hair. If you have long hair, tease the upper half of your head. Everybody also don't forget to hairspray! Obviously, don't tease your bangs.   Guys should never ever wear a ponytail. Short haired girls are allowed to skip the teasing step and wear a deer tail.Girls with long hair can wear a ponytail with all of the hair tied to either side of you, directly behind your ear, and your bangs remaining in their original place. Girls with any hair length can wear pigtails. When styling hair, it is important that all hair on the front part of your head remain flat. Use your ear as a guide. Nothing in front of it should be moved when creating your hairstyles.  Sure, you can go ahead and dye your whole head green but it's a lot easier/healthier/trendier to add a few streaks of any color into your hair using extensions. Fashion core needs to be up to the minute, so this is the way to go. At the moment neon is in style, but check out hair on the runways to see what's in the next season. Also, some people add coontails to their hair, which will probably be on the outs by the time you'll read this. Either go to your local hair supply store and buy the extensions or go to Sally's or even buy them on Myspace. You can glue them to your hair or clip them in. Just make sure to trim the extension to the length of your actual hair when doing streaks. Make it look real. Its not that difficult.  Buy tightest pants possible. Add tight graphic tee, band tee, or v neck. Go to next step. Ladies have the real options. Here are a few looks a scene girl could try out:   A casual look can be skinny jeans in a black/light wash/ripped/neon variety with a tight graphic or band tee. You could substitute t-shirts with other tops like beater tanks or regular tanks in the summer. Try one white or black tank with a neon color underneath. Another idea for the summer is to swap out the skinny jeans for shorts or Bermudas in black and white with prints. A more glam look can be leggings with an oversize graphic or band t shirt. Just make sure the shirt is large enough to cover your crotch but not so large that it is actually a dress. Find the perfect medium between thug tee and baby doll. Dresses are also becoming more popular in the 2010/11 scene. The most popular at the moment can be found at Rue 21 and Delia's.  This is a unisex look.   In colder climates, bomber jackets and fur puffy vests are OK. Limit hats because they crush the hair. If one's needed, choose something bright, beanies, or berets. Scarves and earmuffs are acceptable.  Seriously, no guy-liner unless you're actually a rock star. You will still need to be flawless. Drink 8 glasses of water each day. It really does clear up skin, even better than Proactiv. (You should still wash your face every night!) Wear colorful nail polish. Really, anything will do. Black is acceptable but overused and expected. Guys should not paint their nails as that is way too 1992 to function. Girls should follow the following makeup guidelines:   For the casual look, start with whatever you usually use to cover blemishes. Add blush and cheek highlighter. Smooth a white eyeshadow underneath your eyebrow and above your top lash. Then apply a black eyeliner on top and bottom and follow with 2 coats of mascara. When getting dressed up, use a color eyeshadow on your lids and follow the rest of the directions for the casual look. The eyeshadow can be black or neon. Use whatever colors compliment your eye color. Use blue for blue eyes, pink for hazel, lavender for brown, and purple for green eyes. Or wear any color, as long as you look amazing! When leaving the house without makeup, it is mandatory you wear sunglasses to cover this fact up.  Unisex shoes are great for casual looks. These include Converse, (although Converse have become far to much of a fad - it's best to steer clear of them.) Vans, Reebok Freestyles, and Nike Dunks. Girls can wear ballet flats or pumps with any outfit and probably get away with it. Flats are getting more and more popular. It's mandatory to own at least one pair of black flats. It's also good to have silver or white. Collect tons of different colors to wear with different outfits. TOMS shoes and moccasins are also becoming more popular. Don't wear boots unless they're flat.  Girls can wear these for a casual look as well. Girls also wear necklaces with over sized pendants as well as bangle bracelets. Light, dressy scarves are acceptable as well. Pearl necklaces and silver necklaces with random pendants on them are great too. Don't wear those gummy or rubber band bracelets as they are truly passe. An actual rubber band that really does tie things is an acceptable piece of jewelry for both sexes. Girls should also wear a hair bow or a headband. Tiaras are for birthdays only. Girls can wear those 3 in 1 belts if they want to glam up. Only wear the ones with snaps instead of the ones that loop through a buckle. Also, if you need to wear glasses, they should be plastic. The current trend is to get your grandma's old huge plastic frames and get them filled with your prescription. If you don't have those, get prescription Ray Bans.  You could do something creative with your pictures like give yourself porcelain skin or purple eyes.  Facial piercings, plugs, and tattoos are scene too. When getting a tattoo, just make sure not to get any tribal tattoos. Nothing in this step is mandatory though.  Try not to do the hold-the-camera pose, the "oops" face, or the peace sign. Using a self-timer, take pictures of yourself outside, in looking out of a window, or write your best friend's name on your palm. Upload! Get a high-quality camera instead of just using the camera on your phone.   Create your own Myspace and be famous with lots of friends. Create proof of yourself using a picture or video. For example, you could have a photo of yourself holding a piece of paper with your URL or a video telling your URL.  Have you added everyone in your area in your age range? That's a good start, but if you want fame, which you DO, you're going to need a higher friend count than that. Go to friend adding sites. Add kids who look scene. Myspace only lets you add 400 people a day, so hop to it! Strive for a six figure friend list. Nothing in this step is mandatory. Fashion-core is about fashion. NOT about having a bazillion friends on Myspace. This actually has NOTHING to do with it, but it may help.  Add all the bands you liked on Myspace and find what dates they are coming to your town. Go to every show you can even if its local. You need to be seen to be Scene. Make sure to post bulletins telling people what show you're at and tell people to say hi to you if they see you. Bring a friend so you don't look lame and make sure you look your absolute best. Learn to do the dances you see at the shows. If you have a band, talk to the band after the show. They probably know people who can get you gigs. Again, nothing in this step is mandatory. If you're not overly obsessed with music and going to shows, you don't have to. Be yourself. Don't try to be something you're not, or you will be labeled as a poser.  An iPod touch works well too. Decorate it by adding small rhinestones, using Sharpies, and adding cell phone charms. The more cell phone charms, the better!  , Doing this ensures that everyone knows where all the action is at. After a fun night, post a blog detailing all the upscale things you did. They don't need to be upscale, just make them seem like they are. For example, if you go to McDonald's, say you went to a restaurant with friends. Don't divulge every detail of your life. Make yourself seem mysterious.  If you do it too often or too little, people will find you boring. Try to post pictures with your hot friends, but just make sure you are the best looking one in the picture.  Try not to watch television if possible. Go to coffee shops, techno clubs, shows, the mall, the movies, whatever. Just don't be boring.  Also read NYLON and Miss Behave magazines.  Just because it's scene to listen to a certain band does NOT mean you have to if you don't want to.  

download music.  cut your hair.  style it!,  hair color isn't that important.  fashion-core boys have it easy here.  in the winter, wear a cardigan sweater or a hoodie.  make your face all pretty.  shoes!,  now for the trimmings:  guy accessories include bandannas , huge sunglasseswhite pyramid belts and over sized novelty belt buckles.  photoshop your pictures.  have piercings or tattoos.  take flattering pictures of yourself and put them on your myspace.  add, add, add friends on myspace.  by now, you should have listened to some with all the dance parties you must have had while getting your fashion-core on.  get an internet capable phone like a sidekick, iphone, or anything of the like.  post tweets on twitter or facebook from your phone whenever you're about to do something .  add new pictures or blogs every few days.  make sure you're always doing something.  read japanese fashion magazines, such as fruit s. the japanese fashion plays a big role in the scene style.  in all this, don't lose your real self! 

 The major female Greek system is governed by the National Panhellenic Conference (NPC). The NPC is made up of 26 member organizations. They rotate chairmanship within the group based on the date of entrance of their group in the Conference. There are additional sororities that are regional or specific to certain schools. Other sororities are specific to different groups such as minorities or particular groups like music or academics. Most sororities are U.S. based, but many have chapters abroad in countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom.; , A recruitment party from the perspective of a potential new member is different from the perspective of those who are on the recruiting end.   As a potential new member, you will be treated to food and conversation at each sorority house. After each night is over, you will return to your dorm room, and wait to fill out your order of preference.  When you sign up for recruitment, you will most likely be assigned a recruitment counselor to help you through the process. They will help you understand the different rounds of the process, and they are available to answer any specific questions you might have that pertain to what goes on at your university. Usually, earlier rounds start as informal functions, and later rounds advance to be more formal with more pomp and circumstance.  If you have any family members or family friends that have went through the Greek system, you can have them write recommendations for you to be sent to the local sororities to which you are applying. These forms tell the chapters who to keep an eye out for and seek out. Most sororities have their forms online that you can just download, print and mail to the recruitment chair. Having immediate family members such as sisters, mothers and grandmothers that were in a sorority gives you the advantage to being what is considered a “legacy.” In some sororities, this gives you a preferential status, but being a legacy doesn’t mean that you automatically will be given a bid or invitation. That’s up to you to earn. To have a RIF written for you:   Instruct the volunteer writers to visit their national sorority’s website. They can usually easily find the Web site by typing their sorority name into a Web search engine, and following the Web link to their group’s official homepage. Have them download their recruitment form, sometimes called a Rush Information Form or Recruitment Information Form (RIF). Provide a head shot photograph. A 4x6 or 5x7 is an ideal size to go with each RIF. Have those people mail the form to each of the sorority’s “Recruitment Chair” at the sororities’ chapter house address or mailing address.  When going through the recruitment process:   Dress appropriately to the particular round that you are going through. Be prepared to carry on a conversation about your background and your college plans. Refrain from using any profanities.    Consider carrying around a small notepad in your purse to jot down notes between parties. Write down names of and information on people who you met. Write down what stood out to you about the chapter. When you go through long nights of recruitment parties, sometimes the details start to blend together. This will help refresh your memory later. After each round, the chapters will vote on who to ask back. You will be provided a list of which chapters are asking you back. Work with your recruitment counselor to properly fill out the forms to narrow your list down for the next round. Be aware that each university will stage recruitment in different ways with different regulations upon both sorority members and potential new members participating in recruitment. Research your specific Panhellenic system as much as possible before recruitment and always feel free to ask questions.  

understand the greek system.  look behind the scenes of a recruitment party.  know what goes on in your local recruitment.  have others write recommendations for you if necessary at the university.  make a good first impression.  know what to do after the party. 

 Don't get too many items, See this list of what you need:   Rails Minecart Powered rails A pickaxe (stone or better depending on what you will be going through) An axe (optional) A shovel (optional) Sign (for posting information) Extra space for mined items Map Redstone torches (activate powered rails); , Draw out your plan of your railway map, bridges, tunnels, signs etc. The map of your Minecraft city must also be needed to help building.  This is a high-class railway system, so you must build a station for the railway. A tunnel is always the best so it won't block your buildings that you might build on the ground.  Dig in a direction, so you could build stairs instead of ladders. Dig in 2-3 blocks wide.  Make sure you make it convenient enough for yourself. Dig until you reach 8-15 blocks deep.  If there is a cave, change your direction.  It could be 1-2 blocks wide. You could put it to the side or end of your station.  This is a high-class type, so you must make your station clearer and nicer. Start putting more exits of your station, so it would be easier for you to get to it. At each of those station exits/entrances, add signs that says whatever the name of your station is. Since the wideness is 2 blocks, put 2 signs. The signs should be on top.  It could be like an arrow pointing to the direction on the sign.  That should be showing where the exits lead you to, where the trains head to, etc. , Put gold, diamond whatever you like.  It is true that you could get it off your TooManyItems cheat, but this just makes it more real.  Put minecart tracks along the way, but two or three powered rails at the start of the tracks without redstone torches, this helps stop the cart to stop moving. You must do that for all stations to help it stop. Between 7-14 Minecraft tracks, add one or two powered rails along with redstone torches on the wall. This speeds up the cart so it won't stop.  According to building your first station, you must decorate this station too.  Then, name your line. , 

make an inventory with items you only need.  create a (real life) map.  according to your real life map, start building.  when building the station, don't dig directly down.  don't make it too deep.  when you finished digging till your point where it isn't too deep, create an area cleared up.  build your space for your train tracks.  don't start putting the tracks down yet!,  add signs that show the direction of where the station platforms/concourses are.  add information based on your real-life map.  put staircases on your stairs that lead up to the exits.  ,  you could change the colour of your station, not just some boring cobblestone colour.  put a chest that contains minecarts so you could get them easily (consider using ender chests since it saves you the trouble of running around replacing mine carts later).  after you decorated your first station, start building your railway.  use your player minecraft map to help yourself guide you where your next station is going to be.  repeat these steps until you finished your first line.  for interchanging stations with different railway lines, you have to put a note for information about it too.  ,  if any of your lines go through the sea, make sure you dig deep enough for your railway tracks to not get flooded.  

 Developing a positive attitude will lead you to happiness and success:   Look at the bright side of life. Choose to be and stay optimistic. Focus on your good qualities and give yourself a pat on the back. Have faith in yourself. See problems as challenges and opportunities. Say "I can" more often that "I can't" Choose positive-thinking friends. Read inspiring stories/quotes, Repeat affirmations that inspire you and motivate you. Learn to master your thoughts.; , Think of other times when you have experienced a similar difficulty that resulted in a positive outcome. Ask yourself what you did then that made that difficult situation turn OK for you. What specific things did you say or do to successfully overcome the same obstacle that you are facing again today? Remember your previous solution.  There is always a way out of a difficult situation, and you always have options, even if you do not know what they are when things suddenly go wrong.   Take some time to sit down, relax, and brainstorm for possible solutions. This will help you feel less trapped, stuck, or overwhelmed; these are what most of us feel when we start to believe that we do not have options to remedy our problems in life. Reducing these common emotional responses will help you to think more clearly and choose a solution!  , After you have brainstormed for exploring various remedies for your problem, choose one solution. choose the solution that sounds most effective to you (select only one). Keep in mind that you are one step closer to resolving your difficult situation.  Be proactive and actualize your solution. By actually doing something about your problem instead of staying stuck in the disappointment, fear, or overwhelming mindset of your problem, you will begin to feel more hopeful and optimistic about your solution!  , Stay focused on your solution and avoid dwelling on your problem. your solution will most likely create joy, and your problem would most likely create unpleasant emotions that will be counterproductive to maintaining a positive attitude or resolving your problem. Stay focused, and do not lose hope.  Avoid telling yourself negative things like "This is useless", "There is no hope" or "I'll never get through this". When you tell yourself negative things, it creates negative thinking - and negative thinking creates negative attitude. Instead, tell yourself positive things like "I'm gong to get through this" or "There is no problem that I cannot handle". Maintaining a positive attitude all the time can be a difficult task. But don't worry you can surely have it if you believe in yourself!  , For one week treat every person you meet, without a single exception, as the most important person on earth. You will find that they will begin treating you the same way!  , Our attitude is the primary force that will determine whether we succeed or fail. The pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity ; the optimist finds and opportunity in every difficulty.  

have a positive attitude.  think of similar difficulties that resulted in a positive outcome.  brainstorm.  choose a solution.  take action.  focus on the solution instead of the problem.  avoid negative self talk.  make an attitude application challenge for yourself.  believe in yourself! 

 While there are different methods you can use to remove caulk. Get ride of old caulk by slicing it off with a razor scraper, utility knife, or five-in-one painter's tool.          Using quick, sharp strokes, slice through the length of the old caulk and peel off the majority of the loosened caulk using your fingers. Note that metal blades and chemical caulk removers can damage plastic tubs. Use a plastic razor if your tub or shower is made of plastic, not ceramic.; , Scrub the sides of the shower with a dry, nonabrasive pad or sponge to wipe away all residue left behind by the old caulk.          When done, wipe the area down with a damp, soft rag to remove any caulk dust. Dry thoroughly with a dry rag, hair dryer, or paper towels. If your old caulk was made of silicone, you will need to use a pad soaked in mineral spirits. Use a soft rag, however, and not an abrasive one.  Place two strips of tape equidistant from either side of each joint being caulked. The lines of tape should run parallel to each other and be spaced roughly 3/8 inch (9.5 mm) apart from each other.          The tape is used to help keep the bead of caulk straight and uniform.  When selecting a caulk for your shower, use one labeled "Tub and Tile" or "Kitchen and Bath," as these are usually chemically formulated to resist mildew and stick the smooth surfaces like your shower.         In particular, there are two types of caulk usually used for showers: silicone and acrylic latex. Silicone is very flexible, tough, and waterproof. On the downside, it can also be difficult to smooth and may require the use of mineral spirits to clean up. The color range can also be fairly limited. Acrylic latex is easier to apply, clean up, and smooth. It also comes in a wider range of colors. On the downside, it dries harder and shrinks more than silicone caulk does, so acrylic latex caulk will probably have a shorter lifespan.  Trim the nozzle of the caulk tube near the tip, cutting it off at a 45 degree angle.   The hole should only be big enough to fill the joint. As a general rule, the hole of the tube should actually be about 2/3 the size of the actual joint needing to be filled. The measurement for most showers should be about 3/16 inch (4.8 mm). Use a utility knife with a fresh blade or a 1-inch (2.5-cm) wide, razor-sharp chisel to cut the tip off the nozzle. Note that some nozzles actually need to be punched in order to begin the caulking flow. If a nail does not prove long enough, use thin, stiff wire like electrical wire or a coat hanger. Some tubes of caulk will even have a line on the nozzle to indicate the point at which you should cut. If your initial cut produces a bead that is too small, you can cut a little more off the tip. If a piece of plastic remains hanging on the nozzle after being cut, pare it down with your utility knife to remove it completely before starting. Otherwise, this little burr can prevent the caulk from being smooth. To improve the process even further, use 100-grit sandpaper to smooth and right the tip a bit.  Cheaper guns tend to be less predictable and may lead to sloppier application, but a professional gun applies more consistent pressure.          A professional level gun does not need to cost a lot, either. Power caulk guns can be very pricey, but all you need is a professional hand-powered caulk gun, which might fit into your budget better. A cradle caulking gun will produce the best, most even pressure and is a better long-term investment than a frame caulking gun. If using the latter, though, at least make sure to look for one labeled as being "dripless."  , Release the pressure off the handle once you see the caulk at the tip and clean off any excess with a moist rag.          This precaution brings the caulk right up to the tip of the caulk tube, so it will be ready for use once you bring it up to the shower joint.  The nozzle should be positioned at a 45 degree angle out from the joint.          The tube tip should directly meet the surface of the joint.  Press the trigger gently to release the caulk bead into the joint. As you move the caulk gun along the length of the joint, continue applying even pressure to create an even line.          You can either push or pull the gun. It is entirely a matter of preference, so do whichever option feels most comfortable to you. If you are right-handed, you might find it best to brace the nozzle with your left hand and squeeze the handle with your right. For left-handed individuals, try the opposite. After squeezing your nozzle the first time, do not squeeze it again until there is a good size drop coming out of the nozzle.  If the rate at which the caulk is flowing differs too much from the rate at which you move the caulk gun, you could end up with a messy situation.          If you move the caulk gun too fast, the bead will become too thin and will break too quickly. If you move the caulk gun too slow, you will end up wasting caulk and creating more mess.  Caulk should only be used to temporarily patch up small patches of missing grout in between tiles. If a large amount of grout is missing, caulk is not a good substitution.          Ultimately, patching up missing grout with more grout is a better alternative, but it can be difficult to do without the exact shade of grout used. For larger patches of missing grout, you will need to scrape the old grout out with an oscillating tool equipped with a tile blade before re-grouting. Even if you do use caulk to temporarily repair a few small gaps in your tile grouting, you should not treat this as a permanent solution. If the grout is getting old, you will need to replace it sooner or later.           Look for areas where holes have already developed. Chip away the grout surrounding the hole to get rid of the weakened grout around that hole. Work carefully so that you do not crack the tile by accident.  Quickly swipe a small bead or line of caulk over the hole to fill it in. Hold the tip of the nozzle at a 45 degree angle from the hole itself.          Use even pressure as you drag the caulk gun over the hole, and work at a pace that roughly matches the pace of the caulk gun to avoid making excess messes. As with shower joints, it is not necessarily a bad idea to apply painter's tape around the crack in the grout to prevent caulk from getting on the surrounding tile.  You should either use dampened fingers or a moist, lint-free cloth rag to smooth out the bead of caulk immediately after applying it.          If using a rag, press it into and along the caulk with your finger to apply the appropriate amount of pressure. Work in a continuous motion to avoid inconsistencies and to create a smooth, concave line. If you can do both at once, you can save yourself time by placing the tip of your index finger over the joint as you caulk. By applying a small amount of even and consistent downward pressure, you can apply and smooth the caulk at once If using your fingertip, clean your finger off periodically with a damp rang to prevent the caulk from smearing everywhere. Smoothing is essential for both aesthetic and practical purposes. During the smoothing process, the caulk is forced to adhere more securely to the surface it fills.  For many silicone caulks, you will need to wipe down the excess caulk with a soft cloth rag soaked in mineral spirits.          Wear a disposable nitrile, latex, or vinyl glove to protect your finger from wear and tear. It also makes the process much easier to clean up afterward since the glove can simply be removed and thrown away.  Peel the tape off slowly and do not let it touch any of the fresh caulk.          If the tape left "ridges" of caulk behind, you should clean these up by smoothing the area out again with a damp rag or damp finger. Pull the tape off at a downward, outward angle.  You should wait for at least 24 hours before running the water or using the shower.          If you run the water over the caulk before it finishes curing, you might rinse some of it away or cause it to smear and run, creating a big mess.  

slice away old caulk.  clean off any residual caulk debris.  line the joints with blue painter's tape.  use the right caulk.  trim the nozzle.  invest in a good caulk gun.pick out a professional level caulk gun.  give the handle a little squeeze.after placing your caulk tube in the caulk gun, give the handle a slight squeeze to begin the flow f caulk.  position the caulking gun equidistant from either side of the joint.  apply even pressure as you move the caulking gun along the joint.  match your speed to the speed of the gun.  assess the damage.  remove loose grout.use a utility knife with a sharp blade or a scraper with a sharp edge to gut the damaged grout out.  apply a small bead of caulk.  smooth the caulk while wet.  clean with mineral spirits, if necessary.  remove the tape.  let the caulk cure before using the shower. 

 Whether you’re looking at a printed stereogram or one on your computer monitor, get as close to the image as you comfortably can. Don’t worry about focusing on it; in fact, try to look through the image, not at it.It's usually easier to view the stereogram in printed form rather than on a monitor, so if you're having trouble seeing it on your computer, print out a copy to work with instead. If you normally wear glasses or contact lenses to help with your vision, wear them when you look at the stereogram.; , As you move away from the stereogram, your natural instinct will be to try to focus on the image. Keep your eyes from doing so by continuing to look through the image as you step back. If your eyes start to focus on the image at any point, move closer to the stereogram again, and repeat the process.Don’t get discouraged if your eyes keep managing to focus on the image as you back up. It’s normal for it to take several tries before you get it right. It can help to pretend that the stereogram is a window and you're trying to look at something through it to avoid focusing on the image itself.  At the right distance, you’ll begin to see that the patterns overlap one another and blurry 3D images may begin to appear. Continue to look at the blurry 3D image at the same distance and in the same position. It will eventually sharpen and come into focus.Remember to have patience. It can take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes for your eyes to naturally bring the hidden stereogram image into focus. If you lose focus on the image at any point, repeat the process from the beginning to refocus your eyes.  

place your face directly in front of the stereogram.  slowly start to back up.  move your head back and forth. 

 You can identify the caller before picking up the phone and, if it is an unwanted call, hang up or let the call go to your messaging service.; , Nearly all phone companies have ways in which you can block calls from specified numbers. With some companies, it can be done by entering a code and then typing the number to be blocked. Check with your telephone service provider to see their procedure., If you have a "trap" applied to your phone , incoming phone calls will be tracked back to their real destinations (not the fictitious tracking information that robocalls provide on caller ID) and can be blocked in the future. Trap lines are now offered by private companies and many telephone service providers., While many people know of the national Do Not Call list, private companies are also mandated to remove anyone who asks from their call lists. As with the national Do Not Call registry, your request must be renewed every five years., If your phone company has failed to protect you from unwanted calls so far, ask to be put in touch with their Annoyance Desk/Annoyance Department the next time you talk to one of their representatives. Most companies have a such special group, and usually they largely deals with harassing calls.  

use caller id.  block a phone number.  set up a "trap".  ask to be put on a company do not call list.  contact your telephone company's annoyance desk. 

 Looking confident is one of the most important parts of being persuasive. If you're not sure, then why should they trust you? Stand up straight, look people in the eye, smile, and keep your voice even and enthusiastic. Also dress nicely and not like a sweat pants and t-shirt.; , Do research on the computer or in the library. Know everything that you can possibly know about what you're trying to talk them into. You're not going to be very convincing if you tell them something that they know isn't true.   Where you get your information will depend on what you're arguing for, but try to only get your information from reliable, legitimate sources. It's a good idea to research all sides of the issue as well. Play devil's advocate with yourself!        , They'll probably have some arguments against what you're trying to get them to do. Know some of the most common arguments and be ready with a good way to win them over.  Keep calm and turn on the charm. Seriously though, if you start shouting or get all whiny, no one is going to listen to you anymore. It becomes like tuning out a small child. Keep calm and friendly in your demeanor and you'll be fine.  If you can, it's best to get to know your audience before you try to persuade them of anything. Develop a bond with them, because if they trust you, they'll be much more likely to listen to you. Even if it's just a half hour of trust building, anything helps.   Depending on the situation, how you bond with them may change. A good basic place to start would be to say, "Can I take you out for a cup of coffee?" While you're having coffee, talk to them about what's been going on in their life and the exciting or challenging things they have coming up. Offer them some solid advice and help them if you see an opening. Try not to persuade them during this meeting unless your matter is urgent. Take them out another time at least a week later, catch up on what you talked about previously, then get to work persuading.  Look at where your audience is coming from. Are they poor, rich, middle class? Do they live in the city, suburbs or the country? Do they come from this country or are they from somewhere else? Where do they work? Our background heavily influences how we perceive arguments and what arguments work best on us.   For example, if you're trying to persuade someone who's rich to buy something that looks low-class, sell it as "kitsch" or "Americana". To a lower class person, sell it realistically as a useful item.  Do they think of themselves as educated, logical people? Do they view themselves in a more emotional manner, like the hero of their own life story? How they see themselves will heavily influence what type of evidence you show them when you try to persuade them.   Talk with them for awhile and do your best to get them to talk about themselves. Listen to how they describe themselves or what they do. Do they emphasize what degree they have? Do they mention their church involvement? Do they talk about their kids? Another trick to seeing how they process information is to work them into a discussion of politics. See how they talk about the issues. This can reveal a lot about how they think.  Try slipping your idea into a conversation with the other person, to find out what they think about it. This can help you figure out how you're going to approach the idea with them and how they might react. The more prepared you are, the better.   Try to keep this as subtle as possible. For example, if you're planning on persuading your wife to let you buy a new car, tell her you need advice on something. Your buddy Max wants to remodel his living room (mention the cost as being the same as a new car and detail his family expenses as being the same as yours), but he doesn't know how to bring it up with his wife or what she'll think. Max asked you for advice but you thought your wife would know better. How she thinks the other woman should react can help you understand how she might react and what some of her arguments may be against it.  When you tell your audience anything, watch for their reactions. Watch their face, their body language, and even things as subtle as when they breathe. All of these things can tell you what someone is thinking.   Held breathes indicate anticipation, listening with bated breath, while a sharp exhale usually indicated surprise. Squinted eyes indicate doubt or displeasure, as do crossed arms. Relaxed body posture indicates mild interest or expected information, while upright posture with a forward lean indicates interest, sitting up up and taking notice. Fidgety movements indicate nervousness.  If you really want to be persuasive, you have to be able to change your tactics at a moment's notice. This means practice and it means being flexible and it means thinking things through before you go into them. Being able to react the right way to your audience's feelings can make all the difference.  Choose when to persuade them very carefully. Let's say you're a salesman: you want to sell someone a couch when they're looking at a couch, right? Not when they're looking at a fridge. And you want to pay attention to if they're spending a lot of time looking at different couches and not harass them as they're walking past trying to get to the exit. Timing is everything.  A bored audience is not a swayed audience. Make sure that you're keeping them engaged in the conversation that you're having. Give them lots of opportunities to talk and look for signs of that they're not feeling it (checking their watch, shifting their weight, etc).   You can pull the old teacher trick of randomly engaging them in conversation. Ask them questions every now and again, even if it's just something like, "What do you think of that?" or "What would you have done in this situation?" You can also refocus their attention by making them move, physically. Ask them to get up, look around, or say something. Make sure this makes sense in context, though, and use this trick sparingly.  Before really sinking into your argument, make them see the need for what you're arguing for. Even if there really isn't one, create the illusion of one. For example, if you're trying to persuade your wife to let you get a PS4, tell her about how you've been feeling really restless and bored lately and you're worried about the effect that that's having on your desire to be at home.  Take the most common argument against what you're trying to argue for and make it seem terrible and stupid. Make it seem like the worst possible option, or something that needs to be actively avoided. For example, if you're trying to persuade your teacher to increase your in-class reading time, show her some statistics about how few kids actually have conducive reading environments at home.  Make it seem like the decision they need to make about what you're persuading them to do can only be made for a short period of time. If they only have a few seconds or a few minutes to think about it, they'll have less time to realize they don't really like the idea.  When you persuade them, use language very carefully. Use words like "we", "together", and "us" instead of words like "you" and "I" or "me". This forces your audience to view you as a single unit with similar interests, rather than two separate people.  Use evidence when you're trying to persuade someone into doing something. If you have facts right in front of them that show how great your idea is, it becomes a lot harder to argue with you.  If they're someone who values education, intelligence and facts, appeal to their logic when you try to persuade them. Argue things like, "If you don't do (A) then (B) will happen because of (C) reasons."  , If they're someone that is obviously emotionally prone or strongly values emotions, use arguments like, "You should do (A) because if you don't then (B) will suffer and the consequences will affect (C,D, and E)."  , If they place a high value on themselves, use a similar argument to that for emotions but show the negative consequences for them instead of other people.  Help them see the reward in doing whatever you want them to do. Show them all of the upsides until what you're arguing really does sound like the best decision. Sometimes, you may have to get a little creative and find something that might not be that obvious. Another technique is to ask them what rewards they would want out of doing that thing or what rewards they think they'll get. Good luck!  

appear confident.  know what you're talking about.  prepare for their arguments against you.  stay calm.  develop an emotional bond.  look at where they're from.  evaluate how they think of themselves.  introduce the topic subtly.  watch for their reactions.  change your methods as necessary.  pick the right time.  keep them engaged.  create the need.  demonize the other argument.  make the decision rushed.  cultivate your language.  use evidence.  appeal to their logic.  appeal to their emotions.  appeal to their vanity.  help the other party see the reward. 

 Some people think that they have to act like someone else in order to get a person to like them. However, this is really just tricking that person into thinking you are someone that you are not.   Show your boyfriend your real personality by sharing your interests and hobbies, sharing jokes that you think are funny, sharing what type of music you like, and acting in a way that feels comfortable for you. Do not apologize for who you are! If your boyfriend does not understand or appreciate your personality, then perhaps he is not the right guy for you to be dating.  Although some people claim to not be creative at all, everyone is creative in unique ways. If it feels challenging for you to communicate verbally, another way to get comfortable around your boyfriend is to express yourself creatively.   Show him artwork that you created, songs that you wrote, poetry that you wrote, and things of that nature. If you are into technology, you could tell him about a video game, website, or app that you are designing.  Girls especially struggle with this. There is often a feeling of always needing to look perfect when around your boyfriend. However, displaying confidence even when you do not look perfect helps you to relax around him.If you are a girl, do not be afraid to spend time with him without any makeup. In fact, many boys and men prefer the way girls and women look without makeup as opposed to with it. Wear clothing that feels comfortable to you. You do not always have to dress to impress; wearing jeans and a t-shirt or even sweatpants, if you are hanging out at home, is perfectly acceptable.  One of the most important aspects of any relationship is friendship. The strongest couples are also friends, so if you were not already friends with your boyfriend prior to dating, then build a friendship with him.   Especially when first starting to date someone, it is tempting to act differently around him than you would around your friends. However, showing him the personality and side of yourself that your friends see will help you to feel more comfortable around him more quickly.  

show your true personality.  express your creativity.  feel confident about your appearance.  become friends with your boyfriend. 

 Budget billing makes budgeting easier, since you’ll know exactly how much you need to pay each month. If you’re someone who has limited income or who doesn’t like guessing how much you’ll need to pay on your utilities each month, you might enjoy budget billing. Consider your own attitude towards billing and convenience before deciding if budget billing is right for you., If you have high heat bills in the winter or high electrical bills for air conditioning in the summer, you might benefit from budget billing. Look over your prior electric and gas bills from years past to determine if you paid an excessive amount each month. Take these costs into consideration before choosing to use budget billing.Try examining your bills over the course of the previous year to get an idea of how budget billing might help or hurt you. For instance, if your utility bills over the course of the past three months totaled $600, you might have received a bill for $100, another bill for $200, and a third bill for $300. Then imagine a budget billing scenario in which you paid just $200 every month over those same three months. Which billing style do you prefer? You could also imagine how the end-of-cycle “settle-up” process works. Suppose you only used $190 worth of energy during the budget billing period where you were expected to pay $200 monthly. The extra $10 worth of utilities you didn’t spend over the course of one year could yield a $120 rebate (the total of $10 in monthly savings over the course of 12 months).  Budget billing often lulls poor planners into a false sense of security, since their utility bills are artificially low until it comes time to readjust the utility bills during the next billing cycle. If you are a poor planner, you might not want to use budget billing because you may have trouble realistically seeing the ramifications of your actions in the future.This, in turn, could cause you to reason that since your bills are relatively low, you may as well keep the air conditioning or heat higher than you otherwise would.On the other hand, budget billing might be great for you because you’ll know exactly how much you’ll be paying each month (at least during the budget cycle).  There are two alternatives to budget billing. One is to save money on your utilities. Careful use and management – by using up-to-date appliances, closing the window when the heat or air is on, and settling for a temperature that is comfortable but slightly outside your ideal – is one way. The other way is to more carefully manage your money.During months when you spend relatively little on energy, save an amount equal to what you might under a budget billing system. Use this surplus to pay your utility bills off in more expensive months. For instance, if your utility bill in July is $30, pay the bill and put $70 in your utility fund. When you have higher utility bills – for instance, in December – you can use the money you’ve saved to pay them.  

decide if convenience is important to you.  consider the costs of your bills.  determine if you are a poor planner.  identify alternatives to budget billing. 

 Draw inspiration from all those who only ‘made it’ in later life and who credit their earlier experiences as being instrumental in equipping them for the career they (eventually) found success in.; , Seriously consider your personal position from all relevant angles. Assess your financial situation and other practicalities you’ll have to account for. Be sure you’re not viewing a certain career through rose tinted glasses; talk to those already doing it, research it widely, and develop a genuine passion for it that’s so absolute it’s almost tangible. You will need to completely believe in the goal to ensure others will do too!  , Many older workers become overwhelmed at the thought of starting a whole new career in mid-life, but the process becomes much less intimidating if you break it down into smaller steps. You could start by taking a night class at your local community college, or reading a book or guide regarding your prospective new career. Later on, you might volunteer for a relevant organisation for a few hours a week; work shadow someone within your chosen career field; or start with consultancy or pro bono work for people you know.  Ensure solid awareness of track record, key strengths, career highlights, and sectors where you’re most likely to create interest.  They can offer an objective and professional viewpoint, helping to identify careers suited to your skill set, interests, background and future vision. They will assist in focusing on the target, as opposed to using a ‘scattergun’ approach by pursing too many options simultaneously.  If you’re a worker over 50, and on the job market, one of the things you want to do is leverage your experience. This can be one of your major advantages, and experience is one thing that can’t be bought or learned out of a college textbook. Some workers are afraid to put everything on their resume for fear of appearing too old, or “over the hill” in the eyes of an employer.  If you have college degrees, list them, but don’t give the date when they were awarded. You only need to go back 15 or 20 years when listing past jobs, and it’s best to only include experience that pertains to the job you’re seeking. Don't fossilize. Ensure resumes/curriculum vitae use the latest jargon and drop anything that has lost currency. In some industries the lingo moves on quickly so it’s pointless to use old terminology which is long gone. That is why it’s so key to research your target field, along with the fact that if you’re changing careers, chances are you’ll be shifting to an industry you don’t know much about.  Smaller firms can be more flexible in their hiring guidelines, and tend to be more open to hiring older workers. Your skills and experience may be more valuable here than in a larger corporation. You can find a way into such firms by initially calling up the receptionist. They’re usually very willing to provide information and help.  Social media can be very useful for job seekers and career changers of all ages.  Attend meetings of relevant institutes and have some business cards ready to hand out. Exchange them with anyone who offers you theirs and be proactive in passing them to those you talk with. Be sure to actually get in touch with these contacts afterwards-interacting with people within your target industry is a great way to find out more about it.  When the opportunity arises, point out your experience and positive attributes. Be sure to tell the interviewer about your past accomplishments. Project an air of energy and youthfulness, and make it clear that you intend to work for the company for a long time.  No one is going to make your career change happen for you. Take action every day toward your goals, no matter how small. You'll probably find that once you get the ball rolling, the process begins to gain momentum and taking action will become a comfortable habit rather than something to be avoided.  It may take a little longer, but the opportunities are out there. Just be patient, have a solid game plan, and seek out the employers that put a high value on your valuable wisdom and experience.  

get inspired.  be realistic.  develop a master plan, a blueprint for getting to where you want to go.  know yourself.  consider using a career guide.  leverage your experience.  use your resume/cv to your advantage.  seek out openings at smaller companies.  become familiar with and use online tools like linkedin.  get networking.  always be upbeat and positive during a job interview.  take action on your plan every day.  don’t give up or become discouraged. 

 Unless directed by the referee to do otherwise, simply remain silent and accompany the referee during any pre-match procedures.; , The referee team should review basic mechanics and pertinent deviations from the Laws of the Game authorized by the rules of competition that apply to the game being played (e.g. age group modifications or league-specific rules). The center referee should also advise assistant referees as to any preferences he or she has for the amount of assistance ARs should offer or for the methods of communication between the referee team.  After the coin toss, the members of the referee team should walk together to the center circle, with the assistant referees to the sides of the referee holding their flags furled in the outside hand. If there is a fourth official, he or she should be to the left of the referee. The team should do a quick handshake and wish each other luck at the center mark.  After making sure the team is on the same page, both assistant referees should sprint to the goals in their respective halves and do a quick last-minute ceremonial check of the nets. Once satisfied, they should then run to their respective touchline and position themselves facing the field, even with the second-to-last defender. After counting the players in their halves, they should make eye contact with the referee and unfurl their flags.  During active play, assistant referees should strive to maintain a position even with either the second-to-last defender or the ball—whichever is closer to the goal line.   The assistant referee should stay about one or two feet outside of the touchline in order to maintain a wide-angle view of play close to the touchline and to avoid causing the ball to remain in play if it were to strike the assistant referee.  In practice—and especially when there is the potential for an imminent offside or goal/no goal decision—assistant referees should move in a side-to-side shuffle facing the field. In the event that the second-to-last defender or the ball is moving too fast to maintain position while shuffling, assistant referees should instead turn and run normally. Being in the right position at the right time is of paramount importance.  While the ball is in play, assistant referees should always keep their flags in the hand closest to the referee. Ninety five percent of the time that will be the left hand, unless the assistant is following play upfield. When moving—and especially when running—assistant referees should keep the arm that the flag is in still and not pump it while running. This may sound trivial, but when at full sprint, pumping the flag arm can look sloppy, and the motion of the flag can distract the referee and cause him or her to stop play, thinking you signalled for something.  When a penalty kick is awarded, the assistant referee should position himself or herself at the intersection of the goal line and the penalty area line to allow him or her to more accurately watch for the ball crossing the goal line or for violations by the goalkeeper.  These are as follows:   Always make eye contact with the referee before signaling. Come to a complete stop and face the field before signaling. In all signals, the flag is an extension of your arm. You should be able to trace a line from your shoulder down your arm to the tip of the flag. Signal with your arm held completely straight. If the signal is composed of multiple parts, start the first signal in the arm that will be used to make the next signal. If you must change hands, do it below your waist. Do not signal in an overly hasty manner, but do signal crisply, quickly, and authoritatively. It is sometimes helpful to signal in a manner in which the fabric makes a loud snap as you signal. Hold your signal until the referee acknowledges it, either by stopping play or by waving it off. Then drop your flag and move to the proper position.  When the ball completely crosses the touch line for a throw in, signal by raising your flag at a 45° angle in the direction in which the team entitled to the throw-in is attacking.  When the ball completely crosses the goal line for a goal kick, signal by pointing your flag straight across the field toward the goal area. Use your right hand to avoid impeding your view of the players and the referee.  When the ball completely crosses the goal line for a corner kick, signal by pointing the flag at a 45° angle downwards toward the corner flag on your side of the field—even if the corner will be taken across the field. If you are standing directly on the goal line, take a few steps upfield so that your flag is not crossing the plane of the corner flag and pointing to a spot off the field.  When you detect an offside violation by the attacking team, raise your flag straight in the air. If the referee acknowledges the signal by stopping play, drop the flag to a position indicating where the offense occurred: 45° upward for an offense occurring on the far side of the field, straight across the field for an offense in the middle of the field, and 45° downward for an offense on the near side of the field.  If you detect a foul and are certain that the referee did not see it and would not have applied advantage had he or she seen it, raise your flag straight up in the air. Make eye contact with the referee, and give the flag a slight wave. If the referee stops play, signal with the flag 45° upwards in the direction in which the free kick should be awarded.  In the event that the foul you detect in the above scenario is committed by a player in his or her own penalty area, raise your flag and give it a slight wave, but instead of signaling a direction, hold your flag horizontally across your waist to indicate that the offense warrants a penalty kick. If the referee awards the PK, move to penalty kick positioning.  When the ball crosses the goal line between the goal posts, you will do one of three things:   If there is no occurrence that would bring the validity of the goal into question, make eye contact with the referee and sprint a short distance up the touchline towards the center line. Then record the goal. If there was an offside violation by the team that scored the goal, signal the offside violation. If there was a foul by the team that scored the goal that you believe the referee did not see or any other problem that might invalidate the goal, stand at attention and do not move until the referee consults you about the situation.  If, during a valid substitution opportunity, one of the teams wishes to make a substitution and the substitute(s) is/are ready and standing at the center line, raise your flag horizontally over your head (your hands should resemble the American football "touchdown" signal with the flag held between them). Then conduct the substitution as directed by the rules of competition.  (This is another USA-specific procedure.) In the event that, based on your view of a situation, you believe a caution or send-off is warranted by the laws of the game, you may discreetly advise the referee by placing your hand over your badge to suggest a caution and yellow card, or patting your back pocket to suggest a send-off and red card. (Note: your referee may ask you to follow an alternate procedure in his or her pre-game conference; since the "back pocket" is nowadays quite synonymous with a send-off and somewhat well known by players and coaches, such an overt gesture may tie the referee's hands, so to speak, and fuel any disagreement in the event that he or she does not issue the send-off.)  , After the final whistle for the half or for the match has been blown, assistant referees should furl their flags and rush to meet the referee at the center circle. The referee team should then leave the field together.  

before the game, nearly everything is under the sole jurisdiction of the center referee.  be sure to have a thorough pre-match conference away from participating teams.  stay together.  perform the last-minute needs.  stay in position.  position yourself accurately.  know how to use the flags properly.  position yourself accurately.  know the basic guidelines that apply to all assistant referee signals.  know how to signal a throw-in.  know how to signal a goal kick.  know how to signal a corner kick.  know how to signal offside.  know how to signal a foul.  know how to signal a penalty kick.  know how to signal a goal.  know how to signal a substitution.  know how to suggest a card.  know how to use the flags at endpoints of the game. 

 Depending on the needs of your business and the responsibilities of your employees, you may need to review different aspects of a candidate's background apart from verification of his or her employment history.   The scope and depth of your background check should reflect the nature of the position for which the candidate is applying.For example, if the job entails no financial responsibilities or handling of cash transactions, you probably don't need to pull an applicant's credit report. Likewise, there's no reason to look at a candidate's driving record if his or her job duties won't entail driving for the company (not including the commute to the workplace).  Among the many different background check services, the best for you will be the one that provides all the information you want and doesn't waste your time or money pulling information about employee candidates that isn't necessary for you to evaluate that candidate's viability with your company.   For example, some companies verify an applicant's education records and driving records, but if you don't need this information, you can save time and money by not requesting it.Make sure the service you choose is in compliance with its responsibilities under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The law mandates specific procedures for providing notification to applicants and ensuring all reported information is accurate and up to date., You must obtain consent before you can conduct a background check on a potential employee.   Federal law requires you to inform the candidate that you are conducting a background check, as well as explaining that the information you obtain through the background check may be used in deciding whether to hire him or her.The law also requires you to have written consent from the employee before any background checks are performed. The scope of the background check should be generally explained in the document the employee signs authorizing the check and report.If you're getting a full investigative report, which can include interviews with people who know the applicant, you also must inform the applicant that he or she has the right to a full description of the scope of the investigation and the types of questions that will be asked., The background check service will provide you a report of the results of the completed background check.   Keep in mind that federal law prohibits using this information to discriminate against applicants on the basis of certain traits such as race, sex, religion, or disability. Make sure you're using the information appropriately, and that any information on which you base your decision is directly related to the job and necessary for you to run your business.Under federal law, you must securely dispose of any background report you receive after one year, regardless of whether the applicant is hired., If the information in the background check raises questions, you may need to discuss these with the potential employee and resolve any discrepancies.   In many cases, a discrepancy may be due to a misunderstanding rather than any intent on the part of the applicant to mislead you about his or her past. In some circumstances, it also may be helpful to get the employee's story behind what happened or what led to a particular entry on their background check. If you decide not to hire the applicant based on information contained in the background report you received, you must provide him or her with a written statement specifying the information that led to your decision along with a copy of the report you received. 

decide what information you want included.  choose a background check service that meets your needs.  get consent from the employee candidate.  receive the results of the background check.  follow up with the employee candidate. 

 If you are at least 16 years old, consider getting a small part-time job that will allow you to pick up shifts after school. A job that requires late night hours after school may not be the best job. However, there are many employers that look for teenage employees. It will also look good on your college application to maintain good grades while working a job.Grocery stores, retail stores, and restaurants frequently hire teenagers. Put your entrepreneurial skills to work by starting a small babysitting or lawn mowing business.; , Explore your passions and interests by serving your community. Volunteering is a great way to get work experience while you are still in school. Volunteering, like maintaining a job, will look good on your college applications.Volunteer somewhere that interests you like an animal shelter or local non-profit. Consider volunteering or shadowing in a field that you would like to work after school, such as a hospital or nursing home.  Spend some quality time with your closest friends after school hours. Go to each others houses or meet up at a local restaurant. Invite your friends to attend community or school activities that are planned in the evenings.  Extracurricular activities, like part-time jobs and community service, can also look good on your college application or resume. It shows diversity and commitment to something other than school. Extracurricular activities will also help to teach you time management. You can find extracurricular activities within your school or community.Join a physical activity such as a sport, dance, or gymnastics. Increase your musical ability by learning an instrument or taking voice lessons. Challenge your knowledge by joining a debate or trivia team.  Since you have spent the majority of the day sitting in a desk, it is important to get some exercise after school. Get some fresh air by taking a walk, run, or bike ride around your neighborhood. Consider joining a gym or utilizing your school’s weight room if it is available to you. Challenge your friends to a game of basketball. 

get a part-time job.  volunteer your time.  visit with friends.  join an extracurricular activity.  get some exercise.

 If you’re looking to feel energized and refreshed on a regular basis, exercise is a big part of the equation. One way exercise works to make you feel refreshed is it reduces stress and helps you expend anxious energy. Try to work a 30-minute exercise session into your schedule 5 or 6 days out of each week.Start small by taking two 15-minute walking breaks at work every day. Regular physical activity also helps maintain good blood pressure and decreases cholesterol levels. Exercise stimulates the release of endorphins, which is a hormone in the body that promotes feelings of well-being, even relieving pain.; , Not only can building consistent exercise into your routine help you stay refreshed, but choosing a physical activity that makes you feel happy—without necessarily any set schedule—can help you feel refreshed for an afternoon. Grab a pickup game of basketball or soccer with some buddies to reap this benefit from exercise.   Fun outdoor activities can also include taking a weekend hike, going for a family bike ride, playing softball one Sunday after church, going swimming with the kids, and many more. Try to work this unstructured physical activity in once a week.  Do your part to keep from getting sick by keeping your yearly physical, dental, and eye exams. Sick people do not feel refreshed. Make appointments with your doctors now and keep them every year.   The recommended frequency of doctor visits is different for each gender and age group, but most things are standard for everyone. For example, everyone ages 18-39 should get their blood pressure checked every two years and go to the dentist once or twice a year., Sleep is a major part of feeling refreshed. Lack of sleep affects everything—your ability to focus, your energy level, your emotional well-being, even your productivity. Take measures to ensure that you get good sleep and for long enough.Adults 18 and older need 7.5 to 9 hours of sleep each night. Keep a sleep diary that records how you feel at the end of each day, as well as how much sleep you get each night. Looking back in this diary can show you where you need to make changes., Something as simple as taking a shower can help you feel refreshed for hours. Keep up with your physical hygiene even when you can’t get in the shower to help you feel refreshed. The feeling of oily skin before it has been washed, or teeth that have not been brushed, can weigh on you without you realizing it.   Try changing into clean clothes after you get off work to create a feeling of being refreshed. Taking a relaxing warm bath with scented soap and bubble bath can both relax and refresh you.  

start an exercise routine.  do enjoyable physical activity.  go to the doctor.  get enough sleep.  practice good hygiene.

 Observe other brainy girls carefully. What do you like about them? What do you dislike about them? Make a list of the pros and cons before you consider the change.; , Studies have shown that medium length hair is perceived as intelligent. If your hair is medium length, you can neatly braid it, wear it down and natural or put it in a neat looking bun. If you would prefer to keep it long, that is okay, but, you should make sure it's clean and neat. Whatever your style, make sure it doesn't take too long to manage. You will want to spend more time learning and less time standing in front of the mirror. Keep it natural looking and avoid excessive hair product (including dye, except in a natural colour). A small leather headband is good too.  Cotton polo shirts, T-shirts with the names of museums or with university logos on them, plain and tailored looking pants, knee-length and above the knee skirts and clean, neat, clean-cut and sensible leather shoes/sandals are all nice. Navy blue, plaids and brown also look nice, but don't do it every day. Avoid trends and flashy clothes. Dress modestly. Don't show too much skin.  No glitter or shine. Imitate the makeup of women of stature. Look for inspiration from fashion websites that address makeup for working women, and only use makeup in that section. You don't have to wear any makeup if you don't want to. Avoid excessive piercings.  Sometimes it makes people seem more intelligent, especially rectangle and rounded frames. Keep them clean. Thick frames are especially good. However, if you don't need them, don't be pretentious. , Start to study very hard and keep trying to raise your grades. Ask your teachers what you can do for extra credit. Your teachers in high school will write recommendations for you for college. Keep that in mind! Become a "do-er" at school which means win the science fair, run for office or organize the school dance. Write good articles for the school newspaper.  Many teens show, or pretend to have, a very negative or bored attitude about high school and working hard. They think it is "cool" to be indifferent. Be the opposite. If you don't take delight in school, why waste your time? You are there to learn.  Keep all your work/books/supplies in one place, along with a desk and a strong desk light. Insist on peace and quiet from other family members. If it is too loud at home, study at the public library. Organising your schoolwork and making lists helps you, not just in school, but in life.  Try to raise money and awareness for worthy causes such as "Stop Hunger in Africa" or "Cure Childhood Cancer". You will also feel like a better person for it.  It will give you much-needed focus and make you more relaxed. Eat protein sources: egg white, tuna fish, chicken, power bars, etc. Try out for a good team sport like soccer or something you enjoy. Get good at it and enjoy it. Attend sports camps in the summer for at least 2 weeks. Try to jog, slowly building up to 5 kilometres (3 miles) a day to help your endurance. Also run stairs if you can to build up your leg muscles. A great side benefit is how thin you will stay or become and you will feel great about yourself. Also working out at a gym can build strength and confidence.  Ask if she will "mentor" you during school.  It's much easier to get things done if you clearly outline to yourself exactly what it is that you need to do.  College admissions look at the High School you went to, your transcripts (grades and SAT scores), your teacher/counselor recommendations and what you tell them in your essays about yourself. Finish college applications early when you are a Senior.  Discover interesting things to do with your close friends and when you are by yourself. Try to pick a music, a sport, a craft, and anything else you love.  It will leave you more room for fun. Figure out where you are losing too much time in your day and fix it.  Work at becoming steady and confident. Try to some have composure at all times. Giggling, gossiping and insecurity make you look silly. Practice staying calm under pressure and being comfortable in a variety of settings.  Have your planner out, then put your pencil case on top in front of you. Get your ruler and pen/pencil out, ready to learn.  Teachers will think you are really trying and it could be the few marks you will need to move from a B to A.  

envision yourself as the "smart girl".  cut your hair to a medium length.  dress intelligently.  keep your make up clean and not excessive or elaborate.  wear glasses if you need them.  carry these items: a practical backpack of reasonable size, a good book to read, an address book to put your friends' phone numbers in, notebooks for your various needs, school paper, some pencils with good erasers, some ball point pens, a hand held manual pencil sharpener that doesn't need to be used over a trash bag, some good art erasers, some good eraser caps and a study/day planner.  ,  impress your teachers.  show enthusiasm about school.  build a "homework cave" for yourself at home.  with your principal's permission, start a project in your school.  exercise as much as you can.  find a smart woman for a role model.  set goals.  work hard to get into a good college.  broaden your hobbies.  practice time management.  develop poise.  always have your stationery out in lessons.  answer questions 3 times a day, not by getting picked, by volunteering. 

 Remember, though, to consider the flow of energy and the flow of physical spaces throughout the house. Consider incorporating feng shui principles elements in your design overview.; , Basically each room should be designed by the primary users of the room and the focus should be on filling the space with the look, feel, and objects that provide pleasure and a quiet feeling of "rightness" for those individuals. Some possible designations which might make sense in your home:    For one family member - The room will be used, primarily, by one member of the family. Other family members and friends might visit the room daily or weekly to visit, convey messages, clean, remove clothing for washing, and similar activities.  Essentially, the room will be an individual space and should be arranged and decorated in according to the tastes and desires of that individual. Provide a place where visitors can sit down and feel at home if this function is in the vision for the room. Give primary voice to the individual who will claim the space as their own. Examples of such rooms might be the bedrooms, kitchen for the chef of the family, laundry room for the designated clothes care person, the study for dad or mom or kids, the garage, the shed, the sewing room, the greenhouse, and other similar rooms which are mostly used by one individual family member.    Shared by family members - This could include a bedroom shared by siblings or mom and dad, a family room or den, the dining room or breakfast nook, and similar rooms around the house.  The design should strive to make all individuals who use the room feel comfortable. Each individual should be a participant in picking the elements which provide comfort and should have the right to veto arrangements or items which make them feel uncomfortable. Some family members might not be too keen on having a stuffed elk head across the room or might have a personal objection to a proposed design element.    For guests - Keep things open, interesting, and inviting.  Special use rooms - Included here might be an exercise room, computer room, game room, home theater with surround sound, video or sound mixing room. These should meet the special needs of your family or individuals as well as remaining open, warm, and inviting.  The feeling that is evoked when you enter a room will be a combination of the visual and audio. Primary elements are the overall lighting, be it natural sunlight or mood lighting, spot and task lighting, room color, furniture placement, sound dampening or masking, and the audio experience.  Provide plenty of well-organized storage so that everything is at hand and the room stays naturally decluttered. , Angle chairs and couches so they are about three feet apart.  Color is paramount in making your room comfortable. It will, in large part, set your mood.    Red is a bright, warm color that evokes strong emotions. It is associated with love, warmth, comfort and feelings of excitement and intensity.  Blue is described as a favorite color by many people and is the color most preferred by men. It calls to mind feelings of calmness or serenity. It is often described as peaceful, tranquil, secure, and orderly.Blue can often evoke feelings of sadness and aloofness. It has been claimed that people are more productive in blue rooms.  Green symbolizes nature. It represents good luck, health, and jealousy. Green rooms improve reading ability.  Yellow is a bright that often described as cheery and warm. It is also the color that is identified most easily and detected quickly. It is the most visible color, and can create feelings of frustration and anger. That said, a yellow room can be very cheerful with the right shade.  Purple is a symbol of royalty and strength and is associated with wisdom and spirituality. It often appears exotic or artificial.  Brown creates a feeling of strength and stability. It is often described as natural and down to earth.  Pink' is the color that's most preferred by women. It symbolizes femininity, and fertility. It is a calming color.  White represents purity and peace. It can make a room seem more spacious, however, it also makes it feel cold and bland.  Use an odor-neutralizing spray like Febreze. Open a window to encourage air circulation. Burn incense or scented candles for a mild effect--keep in mind that a strong scent can make some people uncomfortable. Strewing herbs used as a dry potpourri or simmering on the stove are warm, inviting, and subtle.  Avoid putting your things on those sitting spaces (don't throw your jacket or keys onto an open chair, for example). Add an ottoman so someone can prop their feet if they'd like. Keep a blanket nearby, or put a throw on the chair so a person can use it if they get cold.  Use lint rollers often. Remember that some people are allergic to pets. Ideally, you'll want to keep pets off the furniture. , Many people put photo albums on side tables for people to browse through. They're great conversation starters, and a chance for guests to get to know you better. There are also coffee table books which are usually beautifully photographed, which makes them easy to flip through without requiring too much concentration. Adding a simple game like checkers or dominoes for people to play is also a good idea. A puzzle or brainteaser is a nice touch, too!  , 

work one room at a time.  specify who will be using each room on an ongoing basis.  create the ambiance.  provision for utility.  set aside adequate workspace.  ,  make sure to provide enough comfortable seating so that everyone can sit and lounge comfortably.  choose the color you want your room to be.  make sure the room smells good.  ensure that there are comfortable places for someone to sit.  if you have pets, keep their fur to a minimum.  keep tissues within reach.  ,  provide games, entertainment, or anything of interest to look at within reach.  you have finished your room!  

 You will need to work chain stitches in multiples of three, then add one to complete the chain. For instance, your foundation chain could consist of 19 (18 + 1), 22 (21 + 1), or 31 (30 + 1) chain stitches.          You will need to start your work by tying a slipknot onto the hook. See the "Tips" section for more detail. Also consult the "Tips" section for instructions on forming a chain stitch.; , Work one single crochet into the second stitch from your hook. After that, work one single crochet into each stitch of the previous row until you reach the end of the row.          Turn the piece over when you reach the end of the row. If you do not know how to work a single crochet, check the “Tips” section for instructions.  Work these stitches directly from the loop already on your hook.          This set of chain stitches will count as both a half double crochet and an additional set of two chain stitches.  Skip the first stitch of your previous row. Then, wrap the yarn around the hook, insert it through the next stitch (the second stitch of the previous row), and catch the yarn on the other side. Pull the yarn back through to the front of the stitch.          Repeat this process two more times, moving onto the next stitch in the previous row each time. When finished, you should have seven loops on your hook. This step starts the actual triangle stitch.  Yarn over the tip of the hook again, then draw this last bit of yarn through all seven loops previously gathered onto your hook.          When finished, you will only have one loop on your hook. This step completes the actual triangle stitch.  Work these chain stitches from the loop already on your hook.          This will create a gap in between your individual triangle stitches.  Follow the same steps indicated above to create another triangle stitch.          Yarn over the tip of the hook, then insert the hook through the last stitch you worked your previous triangle stitch into. Yarn over the hook from the back and pull the yarn back to the front of the stitch. Yarn over the hook, insert it into the next stitch, and catch the yarn from the back before pulling it to the front. Repeat once more with the following stitch. Once seven loops have been gathered on your hook, yarn over the hook and pull the yarn through all seven loops. This series of moves completes your second triangle stitch.  Chain two, then repeat another triangle stitch exactly as described in the previous step. Repeat this pattern until you reach the end of the row.  Chain once, then work one half double crochet into the last single crochet stitch of the previous row.          Turn the work over at the end of this row. Read more about half double crochets in the “Tips” section.  Work one chain stitch off the loop on the hook to advance to the next row.  The placement of your single crochets will vary based on where they land in the row.          Single crochet once in the first stitch. Single crochet once in the next "chain one" space from the previous row. Single crochet twice into each of the "chain two" spaces from the previous row. Single crochet once into the second loop of your original turning chain from the previous row. Turn the work when finished with this row.  At this point, you should have your foundational chain, your prep row, your first row of triangle stitches, and your second "in between" row. Repeat the steps used for the triangle stitch row and the "in between" row, alternating back and forth, until your project reaches your desired length.          Cut the yarn. Pull the tail through the loop on your hook and tighten it as much as possible to tie off the work. Weave the excess tail into the back of your work to hide it from sight.  

create a foundation chain.  single crochet across the chain.  work four chain stitches.  yarn over as you pick up stitches.  draw through seven loops.  work two chain stitches.  make another triangle stitch.  repeat to the end of the row.  work one chain stitch and one half double crochet.  chain once.  single crochet across the row.  repeat as needed. 

 Take your vitamins, (if you take vitamins). Drink milk, eat foods containing iron, etc.  Use a sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher. If you are pale, you can always use self-tanners.

 Wrap the yarn over the crochet hook three times, working from back to front around the hook.Wrap the yarn in between the loop already on your hook and the opening of the hook. Note that each consecutive yarn-over should be made in between the last one and the opening, not in between the previous yarn-over and the starting loop on your hook.; , Slide the tip of the hook into the stitch indicated in your pattern instructions.   Only insert the tip of the hook. Do not draw any of the yarn already on your hook through the stitch. Keep the working yarn behind your crochet piece as you continue along.  With the opening of the crochet hook still behind the piece, wrap the yarn over the hook once, letting this yarn-over slide into the opening of the hook.   Wrap the yarn from back to front.  Pull the crochet hook back through to the front of the stitch, bringing the most recent yarn-over with it. Note that the yarn-over has now turned into a loop.   There should be five loops on your hook at this point. You may need to keep tension on the previously worked portion of the piece using the thumb and index finger of your non-dominant hand (the hand not holding onto the hook). Doing so can make it easier to slide the hook in and out of the stitch.  Wrap the yarn over the tip of the hook once more time.   Work from back to front again. Let the yarn-over slip into the opening of the hook.  With the previous yarn-over caught in the hook opening, draw it through the top two loops previously on your hook.   If you have difficulty drawing the yarn-over through the loops, gently twist the hook so that the opening faces down and try again. You should be left with four loops on your hook at this point.  Yarn over the hook, then draw the yarn-over through two loops. Repeat this three more times until you are left with only one loop on your hook.After the first repetition, you will have three loops left on the hook. After the second repetition, you will have two loops remaining on the hook. After the third repetition, you will only be left with one loop on the hook. Once you complete this step, you have completed one DTR (double treble crochet) stitch.  Attach the yarn to your crochet hook using a slipknot and create a foundation chain. Your foundation chain needs to have five stitches more than the number of double treble crochets you want in your first row.   For example, if you want to create a row of 10 double treble crochets, you need to start with a foundation chain made of 15 chain stitches. If you do not know how to make a chain stitch or a slipknot, please check the "Tips" section for additional help.  Skip over the first five stitches next to your hook and work one standard double treble crochet into the sixth stitch. Use the same method described in the "Double Treble Crochet Stitch" section of the article.   Yarn over three times. Insert the hook into the stitch to be worked. In this case, it is the sixth stitch. Yarn over once. Draw the yarn-over back through to the front of the stitch to create a loop. Yarn over once. Draw the yarn-over through two loops. Repeat three more times: yarn over, draw it through two loops; yarn over, draw it through two loops; yarn over, draw it through two loops. This completes the stitch.  Work one double treble crochet into each chain of your foundation chain. Continue doing this until you reach the end of the chain.   To complete a straight row, only make one double treble crochet per stitch. Once you reach the end of the chain, you have completed a first full row of double treble crochet.  If you have not done so already, flip the crochet work over so that its front becomes the back and its back becomes the front.   Note that this technique applies if you are working on your second row or any row after that. It will vary slightly from a row of double treble crochet completed from a foundation chain.    The purpose of a turning chain is to extend the yarn up to the finished height of your next row, and the height of that turning chain is based on the type of stitch you will be making in that row. For a row of double treble crochet, you need a chain of five stitches. When counting the stitches in this row, you will count your turning chain as one double treble crochet.  Work one standard double treble crochet stitch into the second stitch of the previous row, counting the stitches starting at your hook. When the time comes, insert the hook into both top loops of the stitch, working from front to back. The double treble crochet you make now should follow the basic instructions provided in this article.   Yarn over three times. Insert the yarn into the stitch to be worked. In this case, that should be the second stitch. Make sure that you insert the hook into both top loops from front to back. Yarn over once. Draw the yarn-over into a loop at the front of the piece. Yarn over once. Draw the yarn-over through two loops on your hook. Repeat three more times: yarn over, draw it through two loops; yarn over, draw it through two loops; yarn over, draw it through two loops. When you only have one loop on your hook, the stitch is complete.  Make one and only one double treble crochet in each stitch of the previous row. Continue until you reach the end of the row to complete a full row of double treble crochet.   Note that for future rows, you will need to make your last double treble crochet into the fifth stitch of the turning chain from the previous row. You can complete as many rows of double treble crochet as desired using this technique.  

yarn over the hook three times.  insert the hook into the indicated stitch.  yarn over the hook once.  draw a loop back to the front of the stitch.  yarn over once.  bring it through two loops.  repeat three more times.  make a foundation chain.  work one dtr into the sixth chain.  repeat the stitch across the row.  turn the work.  chain five.work a short turning chain of five chain stitches.  work one dtr into the second stitch.  repeat across the row.

 Often the manual for the gun will have specific areas needing oil, but a quick look at where the gun is wearing will give you a good indication of the needs.   Be sure to oil the areas around rotating parts, such as the bolt and trigger assembly. Try to keep oil away from the openings into the firing pin housing (oil is a collector of dirt and powder buildup, and buildup around your firing pin can prevent it from firing). Don't forget to oil the bolt rails and the grooves in which they ride. , 

oil all the components requiring lubrication.  reassemble the rifle and make sure all parts are functioning properly.  ,  wipe down the whole gun and remove any excess oil.  

 After the summer weather has faded into fall, and the nights have gotten colder, it's time to plant your bulbs and start dreaming of spring again. You want to plant the bulbs before the first deep frost, which hardens the grounds and makes it much more difficult to dig holes for the bulbs. The bulbs should be planted when the soil is still at least 60 °F (16 °C).Plan to plant the bulbs within a week after buying them. They shouldn't stay above the ground for too long.Don't plant the bulbs too early, or they might come up before the weather gets cold and die as soon as the frosts come. They should lie dormant in the ground all winter and come up in the spring.; , You can get them from a nursery, a home and garden store, or buy them online. Tulips are hardy flowers that will grow in most climates. Depending on what variety you buy, each bulb will produce one 1-4 stems and blossoms.          Choose bulbs that are firm to the touch with a light brown papery skin, almost like an onion skin. Do not plant a bulb that is soft or shriveled, as it may be rotten or dead inside.  Many people plant tulips along fences, walkways, or buildings to add little bursts of color. They're often planted in rows, since it's easy to control where they come up. Figure out where you want to plant your tulips as you get ready to plant them.         Tulips grow best in areas that are sunny or lightly shaded, and not excessively wet. Tulips come in many colors, so it's easy to plant them in interesting patterns and shapes. You could alternate colors or plant a whole bed of multicolored tulips, for example. Design a tulip pattern that makes sense for your yard.  Tulips grow in most soils, and there's not much you need to do to get it ready for planting. However, if the soil where you live is very dry or hard, you can wait to plant the tulips until a day after it has rained. Remove any weeds or stones and use a trowel to loosen and aerate the soil.  Space the holes 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) apart, and dig them about 8 inches (20.3 cm) from the base of the bulb. So if you have a 1-inch bulb, you'll need a 9-inch hole. The larger the bulb, the deeper the hole must be.          As you dig, clear away roots, rocks and other debris that could impede the growth of your tulips. You can sprinkle kitty litter, gravel, holly leaves, or thorny bush branches into the hole to deter mice and other rodents from occupying the hole., Place them in the holes pointy-side up (otherwise they'll try to sprout downward). Sprinkle the soil back into the holes and pack it down with your hands, taking care not to tilt the bulbs in another direction.          Tulip bulbs are naturally perennials, meaning they can come back more than once. In most climates, though, the soil isn't conducive to more than one year of growth, and the bulb only contains enough nutrients for it to bloom once. If you want the tulips to come back after the first year, place some plant food in the holes before closing them back up.  Right after planting, give the bulbs some water. This helps them begin the process of growing. Don't give them a soaking, though; bulbs will decay and die if they get too wet.          Don't water the bulbs again unless it's extremely dry outside. Unless the ground is very dry, there is no need to water the bulbs. Newly planted bulbs may rot if the soil becomes sodden and waterlogged. There should be enough rain through the autumn and winter to provide your bulbs with enough moisture.  By March or April in the northern hemisphere and September or October in the southern hemisphere, your bulbs should have transformed into beautiful spring tulips.         

prepare to plant the bulbs in the fall.  choose tulip bulbs to plant.  decide where to plant the bulbs.  assess the planting site.  dig holes for the bulbs.  plant the tulip bulbs.  water the bulbs lightly.  watch for the tulips to sprout in the spring.

These will let in light for your seemingly dark and forbidding house. , If you want wood furniture, ask a friend who is good with wood, unless you are good with wood yourself. Clay furniture will take up a lot of time, but it's worth it.  Your pet will thank you for this, as wood and clay are uncomfortable to sit on and sleep on.  This is also a good time to think of your pet's personality. Is your new stuffed animal playful? Shy? Caring?  , These spots will be your hot spots. You'll be glad you did this later.  Stuffed animals don't like walking around with no clothes on! Think of pajamas, everyday clothes, fancy clothes, a bathing suit, etc.  Having fun with your new stuffed animal is the most important thing after you get your animal. 

find a fairly large cardboard box.  paint or color the box's outside.  paint or color the area where you will put the door.  paint or color the inside.  cut the door so that it opens and closes.  paint or color the area around where you will put windows.  ,  make some furniture!,  sew a mattress for the bed, cushions for the chairs and couch, etc.  sew some sheets for your bed!,  set up some areas in your house for your new stuffed animal to play, meet friends, hang out, go to a pool, etc.  when you have your stuffed animal, make some clothes for it!,  have fun! 

 If you are converting the weight of a real-life object, you can use a scale to weigh it. If you already know the weight in pounds, just write the number and label it "lbs".   Let's follow along with an example. Say that a newborn baby is weighed at the doctor's office and found to be exactly 10 pounds. We would start our conversion by writing 10 lbs on the paper.; , This is the number of ounces in one pound.   In our example, we would multiply 10 × 16 to get 160.  Writing "ounces" or "oz" next to your answer is important. If you don't, it won't be clear which units you converted to. If you're doing this work for school, you may even lose points for forgetting to label.   In our example, we would write our answer as either "160 ounces" or "160 oz." Both mean the same thing.  Division is basically the "opposite" of multiplication. This means that dividing by the same number that you multiply by will "undo" your work. In other words, dividing a number of ounces by 16 will get you an answer in pounds.   In our example, dividing the baby's weight in ounces by 16 gets us 160/16 = 10 lbs. Don't forget the "pounds" label.  

write the number of pounds.  multiply by 16.  don't forget the "ounces" label.  convert back to pounds by dividing by 16. 

 Bullying is a serious problem that can have lasting emotional and physical effects. Talk to an authority like a guidance counselor or principal about what’s going on with you. Adults at school are trained to intervene, offer protection, or help you find strategies to deal with the situation.   Talk to a mental health counselor, especially if you afraid for your physical safety or are feeling suicidal. These are serious matters that need to be handled immediately. Approach your guidance counselor and say, “Mr. Alexander, I really need your help with something serious. Can we talk?” Tell a teacher. If you are being bullied in school, teachers may be the adults you feel closest to. Try saying, “Hi Mr. Taylor. Can I talk to you? Something is really bothering me and I need your advice.”  , Although it is not recommended that parents get directly involved in bullying that goes on at school, you can still let them know what’s going on. A family member can advise you on how to approach adults at school or talk to you about what to do or say when faced with a bully.   Talking about bullying can be hard, so talk to a family member that will support you. Try saying, “Uncle Eric, I really hate going to math class because Kristin constantly makes fun of me. What should I do?”  , If you can’t bring yourself to talk to someone you know, or if you need more assistance, get in contact with someone trained to handle your situation. You can do this by calling a hotline or even sending an anonymous email through a website. Most contact options are anonymous and provide someone to listen to your issues and help you cope.

 Not all family histories have to be massive recordings of multiple generations. You could just create a story of your immediate family -- your parents and siblings or your spouse and children.Get a rough idea of how far back in history you intend to search. This will help you decide what kinds of resources you need to explore. In addition to deciding how many ancestors you want to include, you should also consider if there is a particular geographical location you want to stick to. If your ancestors immigrated, do you want to conduct research about their lives in another country or do you want to keep it centered in one specific location?; , Similar to deciding on your scope, a clear research question will help guide your research. Is there a particular ancestral figure you want to focus on?For instance, do you want to know why one branch of your family moved to another region of the country? Do you want to know the source of an old feud with another family? Asking something specific will help you narrow your scope and then branch out into other information.Decide what you already know. How much information do your already have on your family? What gaps in knowledge exist? How do you intend to fill them?  , In the digital age, resources for finding information on your family can be easily accessed on the internet. Here are some types of records that can help you build a family history:Land deeds and records (often available about the National Archives' web site for the U.S. as well as the records division of your local county courthouse) Census information (available at the U.S. Census Bureau's web site) Military records (National Archives) Ship passenger arrival records and land border entries (National Archives and The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation Inc. web sites) Engagement/wedding announcements, birth announcements and obituaries (often in local newspapers or church bulletins) School yearbooks or old transcripts (usually available from the person's alma mater) Legal documents such as wills and testaments (also available at their corresponding courthouse) Church registries (check with local churches if you know your family has a history there) Old letters, journals or diaries from ancestors (ask older relatives if they have these) Family recipes and/or cookbooks  , While records and written documents will give you important facts, visual sources will make your history more engaging to read. Look for old family photographs, maps of land, posters, postcards, and newspaper clippings to include. Nothing will make your history feel more alive than actual depictions of your ancestors.Look for other physical items such as childhood toys, clothing, jewelry, kitchenware, and mementos/keepsakes kept by your older family members to include in your family history. These items will give you a sense of your relatives' tastes and interests beyond a basic genealogical record.  Genealogy libraries specialize in resources for finding your family history. They often include extensive microfilm collections where you can read a variety of helpful sources all in one space.Some of the most well-known genealogy libraries in the U.S. include the Library of Congress, the New York Public Library, the Midwest Genealogy Center, the Family History Center in Salt Lake City, the New England Historic Genealogical Research Center Library, and the Clayton Library Center for Genealogical Research in Houston.You may find that taking the time to visit one of these libraries will actually save you time in the long run because of the wealth of resources they provide all in one place. You should also check your local library system to see what kind of genealogical resources they provide.  If you are limited in your ability to travel to libraries, then try to use on-line resources. Web sites such as Ancestry, AfriGeneas, Find A Grave, Archives.com, and Genealogy provides lots of great tips for starting your family history.They will often provide timelines and checklists so you can properly organize the information that you are gathering and save it in a digital space. On-line resources will also be convenient for sharing materials and records with other family members if you don't plan to send a physical copy of your family history to many readers., Sometimes the best historical sources are your current relatives. As you are gathering information, structure your interview around want you want to know. Do you want to hear about a particular time or period in this subject's life or do you want a general overview of their family history?Schedule the interview for a time and place that is convenient for your subject. This may be in their own home or in a more public place. Document the interview. You should plan to take notes during the discussion -- don't just assume that you will remember everything afterwards. If you don't want to take notes, try to record the interview with a recorder or video camera.Ask important questions. These should include fact-finding questions (like the names of relatives/dates of important events), but you can also ask substantial questions about family traditions or customs, family trips, and how your subject related to their local communities. Respect sensitive subjects. Over the course of a person's life, they may experience something very painful or have a moment they do not want to revisit. Respect your interviewee when they say they don't want to discuss something -- don't push them or make them feel uncomfortable.If you do not know your interview subject well, consider asking if a close friend or relative of theirs will accompany you during the interview. This might make your subject more comfortable while they are talking to you if you are a stranger., Some genealogical histories are simply lists of names, birth and death dates, marriages and offspring. While this is a good place to start, it probably won't give a very in-depth view of the personalities belonging to the people in your family.Focus on narrating the story of your family rather than simply making lists on a family tree. Give details about your ancestors based on the research you have compiled. Did the family suffer financial ruin at one point? Did they have any disputes in court? Did anyone commit a major crime? These are the kind of substantial details that can make your history a compelling text to read. Consider if you want to divide sections of your history by time or by geography. For example, if one branch of your family is from one state, but another branch of the family still lives in a different country, consider dividing the family history into regional or geographical sections rather than by a historical timeline.  If you are putting your history into a book format, you should have some tools that will make it easily accessible for your reader. The most helpful tools will be a Table of Contents (so your reader knows how the history is structured) and then an Index of Names at the back.   The Index will be especially helpful to a reader who wants to learn about one member of the family in particular., You don't have to follow each family member's life from the moment of their birth to their death. Opening a chapter with the sentence, "Beauregard Fortiscue was born on October 9, 1875" will often put the reader to sleep because they already sense the arc of this story.Instead, open with a compelling anecdote about your subject. Have you found a long lost love letter from Beauregard to his wife? Do you have evidence that he was entangled in a bitter land dispute with a neighbor? These are more compelling stories to use as an introduction to his history and they will hook your reader early on.  There are number of style guides you can use for correctly citing your sources, such as the Chicago Manual of Style or Modern Language Association style book. Pick one style guide and apply it to the sources in your project.You will generally need to cite a source whenever you directly quote from it or whenever you refer to it generally (as when you paraphrase or summarize a section from it). Most citations require the name of the author of the source, the date it was published, and the title of the work (such as The Journal of Beauregard Fortiscue, 1888-89). Sources from records such as the census or other similar documents should also be cited. Consult the style guide for specific instructions on how to cite it properly.  The best way to improve your writing is to get feedback from other readers. Consider joining a local writing group (often hosted at local libraries or community centers).If you have some extra money, you can also consider taking a class in non-fiction writing at your local college to help improve your writing skills. Writing groups will also give you a set of deadlines to meet while you are drafting your project.  You can also hire a proofreader to help you with this if you want to spend more time focusing on the content of the story. Try looking for local freelance writers or even asking students in a graduate writing program if they want to take on a side project., Self-publishing might be the best route for your family history; it is likely that your broadest audience is your own family (and future family members), so most major publishers will not take on your project. But there are lots of options for self-publishing today:Look for local printers who use Xerox DocuTech if you only want to print a limited number of copies. These are often lower-cost options that also provide a quick turnaround.Consider print-on-demand publishing. On web sites like Lulu, you can print one book at a time directly from a computer file (rates begin at $13 for 24 pages). This is a good option if you think you might only want a couple copies of your history.You can also turn your history into an e-book for free on web sites like Scribd., While you might assume that your family history should take the form of a book, there are many other formats to consider as well.   The website PlaceStories allows you to pick notable addresses on a digital map and then attach stories to them. You can consider using this site if you want to base your history geographically.Vlog your research. You can also make a series of videos in which you discuss your research and then upload them to sites such as YouTube or Vimeo if you want to orally tell the story of your family.Consider using a digital newsletter that you can email to your friends and family. Each newsletter can feature a story about a different relative in your family history and it will present the information in easily digestible chunks as opposed to one long book. You can use services like MailChimp or ConstantContact to create these kinds of newsletters and mailing lists.  In a survey conducted by Ancestry.com, more than 67% of users reported that learning about their family histories made them feel wiser; a majority of users also reported that it helped them feel closer to older relatives.If you have been looking for a way to get closer to relatives you don't know very well or whom you have lost touch with, then researching a family history can be a great way to do this.  If your family belongs to a marginalized or oppressed group, writing a family history can also help you dismantle racist or stereotypical narratives about your family's ethnic or religious background. Writing can become an act of empowerment for your family and broader community., Writing can have significant benefits for your mental and physical health. Studies have shown that writing can ease symptoms of depression and anxiety.It has also been show to reduce symptoms in cancer patients.Not surprisingly, the mental work of writing has also been shown to boost your memory.

It can take some time to conceive after you stop birth control, so stay diligent.   Stop using condoms or spermicides as soon as you decide to get pregnant. Because these forms of birth control don’t use hormones, there may be no delay in getting pregnant. Stop taking your birth control pills or have any devices such as IUDs removed. Recognize that it can take up to six months for your cycle to become regular and for you to ovulate after stopping hormonal birth control.; , You’re most like to get pregnant when you are ovulating. From monitoring cervical mucus to taking your basal temperature, watching your menstrual cycle can help you detect ovulation, which may increase your chances of conceiving.Many smartphones offer apps that can help you track your ovulation.  A woman’s cervical mucus changes consistency depending on her cycle. Watching for differences in your cervical mucus may help you conceive more easily.Look for an increase in mucus and a change in consistency to thin and slippery around ovulation. Following ovulation, cervical mucous decreases, thickens, and is generally less noticeable.Be comfortable and extremely diligent when examining your cervical mucus to increase your chances of conceiving., Observe the “standard rule” that menstrual cycles average between 26 and 32 days for most women. Watching the calendar can help you figure out the days when you are most likely to conceive.Watch for changes in your cycle around day 14, which is the approximate day on which many women ovulate.Be aware that this can vary from person to person. Consider enjoying sex more often between days 8 and 19 of your cycle to increase your chances of getting pregnant.Keep a small calendar with you so you can track the days of your cycle.  Your basal body temperature, or your body’s temperature while fully resting, can increase slightly during ovulation. Take your temperature every day before you get out of bed in the morning to measure your basal temperature and increase your chances of conceiving.Use a thermometer specifically designed for taking basal temperature. You can get these at many pharmacies and medical supply stores.See if your basal temperature increases up to 1 degree Fahrenheit (.5 Celsius), which might indicate ovulation.Take your temperature right after you wake up and before you get out of bed as your baseline number. Make sure to continue measuring your temperature at the same time every day.Write your temperature down in a notebook and see if you notice any patterns.Most women are fertile in the two to three days before their temperature rises., If tracking mucus, days, or temperature feels like too much work to you, buy an ovulation predictor kit. These tests can predict ovulation or signal it before it happens.You can purchase an ovulation predictor kit at a pharmacy. For most kits, you will need to start using the kit on day 10 of your cycle, but check the instructions that come with the product to be sure. When it is time to start using the kit, you will urinate on the test stick to see if you might ovulating., They key to getting pregnant in most cases is to have sex.

She can run tests to determine if you have a fertility issue or recommend a specialist for high-risk pregnancies.Be open and honest with your doctor about what methods you’ve been using to increase your chances of conceiving. Take any notes you’ve kept on your cycle. Ask any questions you might have about conceiving or your chances for getting pregnant.  There are a variety of reasons that may prevent you from conceiving naturally including structural issues with either the man or the woman.Determining what is impeding your ability to conceive can help your doctor formulate a more effective treatment plan and may also help you get pregnant. Undergo any tests your doctor might suggest for you and your partner including:   Semen analysis Hormone testing Ultrasound of the scrotum (for men) or uterus and fallopian tubes (for women) Testicular biopsy Genetic testing Ovulation testing with blood Imaging tests such as hysterosalpingography or hysterosonography., If your doctor determines that something specific is impeding your ability to conceive, treat the disorder.

After fertilization, the embryos are implanting into the woman.Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), in which a healthy sperm is injected into a mature egg.Donor eggs or sperm. Although most couples will use their own eggs and sperm, if there are serious problems with either the eggs or sperm, you can opt to use a known or anonymous donor egg or sperm.Gestational carrier.

 Some dents are best accessed from behind. This is especially true for dents with very small diameters that are difficult to remove with other methods. Determine if the dent you intend to remove is located somewhere you can access by removing components of the body.You will likely need to remove body components to access a dent from behind. Determine if you can gain access to the dent based on the tools you have on hand and your level of expertise in removing and replacing body panels.  Once you have identified what components of the body you will need to remove to gain access to the dent, lay down blankets on the ground for any painted pieces you will need to remove. You may also need to replace mud guards from the bottom of the vehicle, tail or headlights or the wheels.Be careful not to lose any of the hardware used to fasten the body components to the vehicle that you remove. Never lay painted components down on blacktop without a blanket or something to protect the paint.  Once you are able to access the back side of the dent, jack up the car if need be and find the dent from the inside. You may need a flashlight in order to see the inside of the dent.Locate the dent and position yourself so you can reach it. You may need to try multiple positions in order to apply the leverage you need to the dent.  For larger dents, you may be able to apply pressure to the inside with your hands to pop the dent back out. Dents with smaller diameters may require that you press into them with a harder surface such as the handle to a hammer.Attempt to press the dent back out before resorting to using a mallet. There is less chance of damaging the metal by applying pressure than there is in striking at it with a mallet.  Wrap a cloth around the head of a wood mallet to soften the striking surface, then hit the inside of the dent with the mallet. You may need to hit the dent repeatedly in order to knock it back out.Be careful not to bang on the interior metal from an angle or the side of the mallet may create small creases in the metal. Do not continue to hammer on the metal after the dent pops out or you could cause the metal to bow outward slightly.  

assess the location of the dent.  remove body components as necessary.  locate the backside of the dent.  apply pressure to the back of the dent.  use a wooden mallet covered in a cloth to bang on the dent.

 Preventing hemorrhoids from cropping up in the first place is a good way to avoid having to treat them. Try practicing all of the methods below in order to prevent hemorrhoids from afflicting you.   Drink 8 glasses of water per day.Drinking lots of fluid will help. Eat a diet rich in fiber, especially fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, in order to ease bowel movements. Don't be afraid to use stool softeners if necessary.  Hemorrhoids can be caused by excessive straining during bowel movements. Try to let the bowel movement pass without straining or forcing, as this can cause an unnecessary pressure buildup and worsen hemorrhoids.  If you sit for long periods of time, get up and move around. Constant pressure can cause and/or worsen hemorrhoids.  If the area with hemorrhoids itches, apply a bit of witch hazel. When wiping, don't use tissue to itch the area.   Use softer, non-aggravating toilet paper. Avoid toilet paper that is colored and/or perfumed.  Cotton undergarments are very breathable fabrics. They also have the benefit of being softer and less irritating than other non-natural fabrics.  

understand that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  don't strain during bowel movements.  take a break from sitting every once in a while.  don't scratch the area with hemorrhoids and don't over-wipe.  wear cotton underwear.

I will be here when you get out to help you get settled back into your apartment. It might take some time, but you can definitely get over the worst of this and get back to your normal life.”  , If they have a lot of trouble at work because of their IBS, remember to listen to their stories and be there for them. Work life can be especially difficult for people with IBS and they may not have people who listen to them or understand their experience at work. So it is important to offer an attentive and empathetic ear.You might try asking:   "How did your meeting go this afternoon?" "How are things going at the office?" "Do you get any home work days with your new job?"  

ask them how they are doing.  visit them in the hospital.  listen to their office troubles.

 There are a number of great resources to help you better understand depression. These resources can often help with a self-diagnosis, but seeing a doctor is better because even the most intelligent people can easily misdiagnose themselves and a medical professional would look for other possible causes first. You can use a variety of tools you can use to understand more about this disorder.   Online surveys can help identify if you are depressed. They ask questions about your lifestyle, and often include multiple-choice questions to determine how you are feeling. Some surveys include a scale survey that allows you to place yourself on a scale of feelings. Brochures or pamphlets can provide statistics, references, and resources. Many public places like libraries, clinics, and universities have brochures and pamphlets on common illnesses. They often include short informational material like brochures that can give you a quick look at the disease. Non-profits or other recognized organization sometimes specialize in health disorders. Their websites will often provide helpful frequently asked questions. Organization like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) provide information on their websites about depression and other mental disorders. These websites can provide research and scholarly information.  If you think you may be depressed, you may want to visit your doctor. Even specialty doctors such as OBGYNs, Endocrinologists, and Pediatricians have the resources and know-how to diagnose mental disorders like depression.  In the end, you can be your own best research advocate. Take the time to research depression on your own using reliable materials. You can visit a library or an online research database to help you in your search.   You can review the Diagnostic Statistic Manual (DSM), which is the leading book on mental health. It is the standard on classifying mental disorders and can be accessed by the public. JSTOR.org is an open database that allows you to review journals, newspapers, and books. This is a great scholarly resource that you can use to research depression symptoms and treatments.  

reflect and diagnose yourself.  see your doctor.  research the signs and symptoms. 

 Some companies will have a special account for each employee where a portion of the company earnings will go in towards a retirement fund, or a pension plan. These retirement savings plans may require your company to deduct 5 percent of your gross salary, or they may use company earnings to help you save for retirement.Some companies will match employee donations dollar-for-dollar or a percentage of their salary, known as a 401(k). 401(k) plans can help you build a tax-deferred nest egg for retirement. The 401(k) may kick in as soon as you start working for the company or within a certain time period after your start date.  As part of your employee benefits, you may be able to get profit sharing, where you receive a portion of the annual profits of the company. This is often offered by companies who plan to be fiscally stable and as an incentive to keep people employed with the company for a long period of time.   You may be able to get stock options as part of your employee benefits. Or you may be offered an ESOP, or Employee Stock Ownership Plan. ESOPs allow you to buy company stock at below market value.  Many companies will offer a certain number of paid days off in a fiscal year for vacation, such as one to two weeks per year. You may be allowed a certain number of days during your first year of employment and then accumulate more days over time. There may be a maximum number of days you are allowed to accumulate for your vacation.There should also be a note about sick days in your benefits package and how many you are allowed as an employee. There may be restrictions, such as only using sick days with a doctor’s note or only taking personal days if there is a death or serious illness in the family. Check that there is information about holiday pay. Employers should offer paid days off for statutory holidays.  If you are being offered a salary based position, you may not get overtime pay as part of your employee benefits. However, some companies will offer compensation for time that goes above the expected standard, usually forty hours of work a week. You may get a bonus or overtime pay. Or you may get comp time paid, where you get hours off for extra time that you work.If there is no information about overtime or comp pay, talk to your employer about this information, especially if you know the job will require long hours and overtime work.  Look through the employee benefits for information about any reimbursements you may get that relate to your job. You may have an expense account that you can use when you entertain clients or travel for business. You may also be offered compensation for daily transportation costs, such as gas costs, to and from the office, especially if you have a long commute.Read over the employee benefits for information on a mobile reimbursement, such as a cellphone that you use for your job. You may also be able to get reimbursement for parking costs as part of your benefits, especially if the company is short on free employee parking.  Some companies will offer health and wellness benefits for employees like free memberships to a health club. You may also be able to get fitness classes covered as part of your benefits.You may also be offered academic compensation, such as all or a portion of your tuition paid for as an employee of the company. Some companies will pay for you to take continuing education classes if they relate to your position at the company.  

check if there is a pension plan.  determine if there is profit sharing or stock options.  look at the vacation and sick pay.  note if you get overtime or comp pay.  check for business-related reimbursements.  look for any health or academic compensation. 

 The American Kennel Club (AKC) describes the breed as "alert, projecting the ‘terrier-like’ attitudes of self importance, confidence, self-reliance." Though these traits can look cute when coupled with a five-pound dog, Chihuahuas have a tendency to become dominant and controlling if they aren't provided with a strong pack leader - and though Chihuahuas are naturally affectionate and loyal, their mischievous side can lead them to exhibit bad behavior. Unfortunately, because of the increase in popularity Chihuahuas have been receiving, more "backyard breeders" have started breeding low-quality Chihuahuas with poor tendencies of being extremely shy or vicious. Always purchase a Chihuahua from a responsible, high-quality breeder, or adopt one from a reliable shelter.; , People tend to have completely different approaches to behavior from small and large dogs, and this can lead to accidentally reinforcing bad behavior from Chihuahuas. If a German Shepherd growled at a dog in the dog park, for example, the dog would be immediately corrected. If a Chihuahua did the same, people might remark on how cute it is that the Chi thinks he's a larger dog than he really is, or the owner might even scoop him up to "protect" him. Avoid making the mistake of treating a Chihuahua like a baby, instead of a dog - correct your Chihuahua if he behaves badly.  Dogs retain instincts such as the instinct to live within a pack with definite rules and a leader. Domesticated dogs replace the pack with their human family, and expect the alpha of the pack to take control. If your dog believes that you're weak or unable to protect the pack, he'll take over for you! Because we're a different species, it can be hard to distinguish what behaviors count as weak and our desire to see behaviors differently from what they really mean can hamper our ability to properly control our canine companions.   As an example, imagine a dog begging at the table. The dog paws at his owner's leg, staring pleadingly up at his owner. He jumps up so that his paws are on the owner's knee and makes eye contact. The owner, whether seeking to spoil or humanize the dog or from feeling guilty or exasperated, throws the dog a piece of beef. From the dog's point of view, he just invaded the owner's personal space by pawing and jumping at the owner's leg, which is a dominance signal, made strong eye contact, which is a dominance signal, and forced the owner into submission (the owner gave him food). The dog may now regard the owner as weak.  Socialization is about introducing your dog to various parts of life - taking your dog to a park, introducing him to a young child, and so on. Socialization is extremely important for puppies, and it doesn't stop there - adult Chihuahuas should be provided with new sights and sounds as well. If your Chihuahua is scared by something, resist the urge to comfort and cuddle him; instead, gently but firmly require that your Chihuahua face his fear, whether he's walking on a slippery floor or being pet by a stranger.  Though Chihuahuas generally do provide for their exercise needs through play and activity around the house, always take your Chihuahua on a daily walk. Not only does this provide extra exercise (which is helpful, since Chihuahuas can get chubby easily), it stimulates his mind, socializes him, and if done correctly, reinforces your status as alpha. Your Chi should be in the heel position whenever being walked. In packs, alpha dogs lead the way, and your Chi will see being allowed to walk in front of you yet another sign of your inadequacy as pack leader. The same goes when passing through doorways: go first, and have your Chi follow.  Chihuahuas are highly intelligent dogs (if somewhat stubborn), and training is recommended to stimulate their mind, increase your bond, and to keep them out of mischief. Using a positive reinforcement system that requires your dog to think for himself - such as clicker training - is your best bet. Start with simple tricks such as sit, down, stay, come, and heel, and then the sky's the limit - try crate training your dog, or training it to jump on his hind legs!  , Chihuahuas are experts at puppy-dog looks, but sometimes it's important to put your foot down and say no. Though you should always treat your Chihuahua well, sometimes you have to skip the extra treat and give your Chi a bath, even if he really doesn't want one. Learn how to be assertive, and know when enough's enough.  Spread your new-found Chihuahua knowledge around - by doing anything from teaching a young girl that Chihuahuas aren't toys to training your Chihuahua to compete in a dog sport, you'll spread love and respect for this wonderful breed. Most of all, help people learn that Chihuahuas are not vapid accessories for celebrities and fashionistas but are actually wonderfully intelligent little canine beings.  

research the breed.  recognize how people often behave around small dogs.  understand dog pack hierarchy.  socialize your chihuahua.  walk the dog!,  train your chihuahua.  toughen up.  teach others. 

 You can dip raw almonds in chocolate just as well, but toasting them creates extra flavor and a crisper texture. Preheat your oven to 325ºF (160ºC). Toast your almonds on a lined baking sheet for 6–8 minutes, or until they turn golden brown and release a strong aroma.Let them cool while you move on to the next step.; , This will hold your chocolate-covered almonds later, while they harden in the fridge.   For a perfect presentation, place a fine mesh cooling rack on top of the sheet.This will leave a more even coating of chocolate, without the impression where the almond rests on the sheet.  Chop 6 oz (170g) bittersweet or semisweet chocolate into small, roughly equal pieces (~¼ in / 6mm) and add to a double boiler.Heat over low heat, stirring slowly with a rubber spatula, until the chocolate is fully melted. Keep it away from moisture and high heat, which can cause chocolate to seize and turn grainy.You can use other types of chocolate, but lighter chocolate burns more easily. Prevent this by taking the chocolate off the heat when there are only small lumps left, then stirring until it finishes melting. If you want the chocolate to look glossy on the almonds, temper it instead or follow the ganache recipe in the "Variations" section below.  Mix in a large bowl until the almonds are covered in melted chocolate.  Scrape the almonds onto the baking sheet (or mesh cooling rack), then quickly separate them with a fork so they don't get stuck together.For a professional look, get finicky: lift the almonds out one or two at a time with a fork or dipping tool, tap gently against the bowl to remove excess chocolate, and place on the baking sheet., A generous sprinkle of sea salt is an excellent complement to dark chocolate. Large grains of raw sugar are another great addition, especially if the chocolate is very dark., Un-tempered chocolate will "bloom" if left to solidify at room temperature, forming a layer of white fat solids on the surface. To prevent this, let it set in the refrigerator until the chocolate is completely hard. Cover the tray with plastic wrap if there are any strong scents in your fridge.   Condensation may gather on the chocolate after you remove it from the refrigerator, causing a "sweating" appearance. You can reduce this effect by covering it, so most of the condensation gathers on the lid of the container instead.If you tempered your chocolate, you can let it set at room temperature.  Some people prefer the cocoa powder look to the sometimes dull appearance of once-melted chocolate. This is particularly useful if your chocolate has "bloomed" — it's still good to eat, so dust it thoroughly and serve it without shame.  Ganache is an emulsification of melted chocolate and heavy cream that hardens into a glossy, attractive coating. Ganache will also coat the almonds more evenly, adding to the visual presentation.  Chop 4.2 oz (120g) bittersweet chocolate into even pieces less than ¼ inch (6 mm) across. Place it in a large, heatproof mixing bowl.   You may use milk chocolate or white chocolate instead, but the ganache will be too soft unless you increase the amount of chocolate. Try 5.25 oz (150g) of milk or semisweet chocolate, or 6.3 oz (180g) of white chocolate., Pour 3½ tbsp (50 mL) heavy cream into a pot and heat until it just begins to boil. This ratio of 1 part cream to 3 parts chocolate will create a thick ganache that sets into a hard shell.  Let it cool undisturbed for about a minute.  Beating too fast can make a grainy, "broken" ganache. Stir at a steady pace until the mixture is smooth. Do not pause, as you can only form smooth ganache in a limited temperature range.  Toss 1.5 cups (360mL) almonds in ganache and transfer them to mesh cooling racks. The storage life depends on the type of chocolate and many other factors, but it's generally safe to leave ganache at room temperature for two days., Classic pastel Jordan almonds require a more specialized approach, but this rougher riff on the sweet only requires basic supplies:1.5 cups (360mL) toasted almonds  10 tbsp (150mL) granulated sugar 2 tbsp (30mL) water ½ tsp (2.5mL) salt ½ tsp (2.5mL) cinnamon  , The almonds are done when the coating starts to look dry and sandy, about 8–10 minutes., Let cool on a parchment-lined baking sheet in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.  Melt 6 oz (180g) chocolate in a double boiler over low heat, stirring constantly. Once smooth, pour over the almonds and stir until well-coated.  Place the almonds back on the baking sheet. Spread them out with a fork so they don't end up stuck together. Store in the fridge until ready to eat.  

toast almonds (optional).  line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  melt the chocolate.  stir the almonds into the chocolate.  transfer the almonds to the baking sheet.  sprinkle with salt and/or sugar.  let set in the refrigerator.  coat with cocoa powder (optional).  make ganache for a glossy, even coating.  chop the chocolate into small pieces.  bring heavy cream to a boil.  pour the hot cream over the chocolate.  stir in slow, circular motions.  coat almonds in ganache.  combine all ingredients besides chocolate in a medium saucepan.  stir constantly over medium heat.  transfer to the fridge.  coat the sugared almonds in melted chocolate.  let set in the fridge. 

 Add salt.; ,, With the dough resting in a bowl, place bowl in kitchen sink and turn on the tap. Allow water from tap (medium flow) to run into the bowl and start kneading dough in the running water. Yes, keep kneading and washing the dough. The water will turn milky as the starch will be washed away but keep kneading. The dough will eventually shrink to about 20% of its original size and it will feel rubbery.  Remove and drain.  Pinch a piece of washed dough (it’s like rubber) about 2 centimeter (0.8 in) x 2 centimeter (0.8 in) and fry it till it puffs up and turns golden brown.  Dish up and place on kitchen napkins to absorb excess oil. 

place flour into a suitable bowl for kneading.  gradually add water as you knead the flour into a dough and let it stand for 2 hours covered by a piece of moist cloth.  ,  wash the dough.  keep kneading till the water becomes clear.  heat oil in a wok.  manage the heat from the stove so that the oil does not overheat.  finished.  

 Shop at American Eagle, Abercrombie, Aeropostale, Pink, Saks, Nordstrom and all the "in" stores. If you can't really afford it, just shop in the clearance sections. Clothes can be up to 80% off in all the above stores. Also check out their outlets. Before shopping there, look for coupons for up to 25% off, because on top of the 25-90% off sales, sometimes you can add 25% off on top of that with your coupon. You can also shop at places such as Loehmann's, Marshalls, TJ Maxx and Ross if you look for big names such as BCBG, Ralph Lauren, Lilly Pulitzer, Tommy Bahama, Nine West, and Franco Sarto for super cheap prices every day. Plus, if you get a Maxxinista card, you get an additional discount and credit toward your next purchase.   Save up so you can afford designer clothing.; , Shoes make the outfit. The cheaper the shoes, usually the less durable and comfortable. If you're in middle school or elementary, just shop for cute and comfy sneakers/canvas skimmers/Chinese slippers/ballet flats at cute yet cheap stores like Payless or Old Navy. If you have some more money, get shoes like Toms, Topsiders, Uggs, and Converse. If you're in high school or college, you'll just need a few pairs:   A pair of comfortable everyday shoes that aren't sneakers, loafers or moccasins. These can be a pair of metallic leather ballet flats, a pair of pretty purple low wedges, or a pair of pony hair leopard print pointy toe flats. Look into funky neutrals for the pattern, or color such as metallics, a color you don't wear a lot but adore, animal prints, polka dots, black snakeskin. Think of low wedges, ballet flats, 1 inch (2.5 cm) thin heels, and pointy toe flats. These should be comfortable enough to walk to school in, yet cute enough to wear with a flirty sundress. If you pick a shoe that makes a big statement, limit it to the shoe. Don't pair a leopard print flat with a leopard print purse or worse - a skin tight shirt, or a metallic flat with a sparkly white eyeshadow or headband. Tacky much? Black is great in simple leather, since it can be changed to look like a new pair of shoes with shoe jewelry.   A pair of comfortable everyday leather knee high boots. They should zip up and flatter the calves. The should be either flats or 1 inch (2.5 cm) thin heels or low wedges. They can be a nice neutral like black. Be wary of browns and tans because these colors can clash. Look at your skin color and hair color to assess what's perfect for you. Black works for most. But blondes that like to wear earthy browns and neutrals would carry of the earth natural hippie look well with camel colored boots. Make sure you can walk in snow and they are good for rain as well. You can look for very realistic faux leather lined with Thinsulate from good brands such as Enzo Angiolini and Nine west. Unlike the item above, it should not be a metallic/color/print/polka dot/special texture--that would make it less of a staple. It should be dressy enough to wear with a sweet little dainty dress in fall, but comfy too. With this shoe use cheap jewelry from places like forever 21, or Claire's to sassy up outfits.  Why two? Trends change every year, but they always seem to ping pong from oversized to teeny tiny. You don't want to be a latecomer to each and every pendulum swing of the trend cycle. Pick leather because it is classic but always in the moment. Pick a color that flatters your skin tone. Don't pick up metallics, or special prints, but feel free to experiment with color. If you have a special color that you have on your everyday comfy shoe, wear it while purse shopping if you would like to have them match. Look at trends in purses; a major theme is dark colors like rouge, purple, and olive green.  Have two pairs of flattering dark colored (navy) jeans with a super skinny leg. Two t-shirts in colors that flatter you and a construction that skims your curves but doesn't squeeze them. Look into scoop necks and v-necks. If you live in cool climate, invest in a wool coat... Check out places such as Winners, Burlington Coat Factory, TJ Maxx,and Marshalls. Also buy 3 sweaters/jackets in either scoop, v-necks, or zip-down. One should be a basic black, two should be happy colors that make you smile. If you have a school uniform, get at least 5 shirts in bright and happy colors, black or navy skinny/curve-hugging bottoms, and 2 skirts in approved colors. If you can, own at least 1 feminine and pretty sundress.  This is the jacket that you put on over a pair of navy skinny jeans and a black sweater and it becomes an outfit. It becomes you. Think of your interests... Are you a hopeless romantic that gushes over silks and velvets in Victorian colors? Are you a rocker chick that's life anthem is "Highway to Hell"? What jacket speaks to you? What do you put with your boring basics, and it becomes your closet staple? What brings out you in this mass produced world? Scour for it in every single unknown boutique. It's pieces like this that sets your closet apart from the pack. Get one in leather if you're rocker, cute and bubbly designs if you are girly, or plaid/stripes if you are preppy.  Girly girl, what about a necklace with a diamante heart pendant in pink? Like to make jewelry? Make something that makes you smile. Like sports? How about your favorite sports team's emblem on a pendant? Feel like a hippie? How about a hemp string or leather string with a wood pendant fashioned into a flower? If you are preppy, try some pearls. If you are the stereotypical popular girl, wear bangles. Always wear a pair of earrings. Own at least one dangle and one stud. Be creative, and most of all, have something that goes with everything and is totally you.  Go to websites such as style.com and look at designer collections. Look at ways that clothes are being worn. Are brooches being affixed to a certain part of the jacket or dress? It is not necessarily something you have to buy. Maybe you have a wool coat that hits at your mid thigh? Maybe wearing it with your knee high boots and a pair of translucent black tights with a pair of fishnets is what you can do, just like the model in the picture is being styled. Or wearing the wool coat just like that but with a bright maroon belt? Substitute shoes and colors and certain things for your own version. Always be up to date on styles for your grade. Currently, bright colors are in, so make sure to have plenty!  , Do you have something that you used to love, but now don't like it? Something that is too heavily patterned for your taste can be cut and turned into a scarf, which can be worn as a belt. Something that is too 'blah' can be given extra texture with wearing with more colorful clothes, or can use a ribbon a touch darker for a signature look. Go to a fabric store and scour the reduced section for extra things. An old pair of canvas skimmers in basic colors can be sassed up with a ribbon or shoe jewelry. If you have an old t-shirt that you have grown out of, but love a detail in it, cut it out and hem the edges... You can sew it onto a simple white or black tank/tee to add detail. (See How to Modify Your T Shirt.) You can buy tees and tanks real cheap by the bundle, so that 3 dollar tee/tank can look 30 dollars later. Adding contrast stitching by stitching a color obviously darker or lighter on clothing to create a unique look is the cheapest way to rejuvenate a pair of 3 yr old jeans or tees.  Get highlights if you can. Get your hair cut in long and pretty layers. Keep it straight most of the time, yet curl it every two weeks. Keep your hair soft and shiny.

 Combing your hair is absolutely essential to keeping it feeling silky and clean. Tangled bedhead will always be difficult to manage and will serve to damage your hair and keep it feeling coarse and rough. Use a fine-tooth plastic comb and run it through your hair a few times each morning to work out the tangles and leave your hair healthy and silky. /images/thumb/d/d1/Get-Silky-Hair-if-You-Are-a-Guy-Step-12-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Get-Silky-Hair-if-You-Are-a-Guy-Step-12-Version-2.jpg /images/thumb/d/d1/Get-Silky-Hair-if-You-Are-a-Guy-Step-12-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Get-Silky-Hair-if-You-Are-a-Guy-Step-12-Version-2.jpg          If your hair is especially tangled, use a small dab of oil on the comb to help work it through and treat your hair. You can also use a little bit of water. Depending on the thickness of you hair, it may be more appropriate to brush it, especially with coarse hair.  If you have coarse or curly hair, a flat iron can help you achieve a silky texture. However, keep in mind that flat ironing and other heat-based treatments can damage your hair, so use a few protective measures:Flat iron your hair while it is completely dry. Wet hair is much more susceptible to heat damage than dry hair. Use a heat protecting spray, cream, or serum on your hair before straightening. Avoid going over the same section of your hair more than once.  Blow-drying your hair can also help keep your hair silky. You can take a few precautions to prevent your hair from getting dried out or heat damaged from excessive blow-drying:Towel dry your hair before blow-drying it. This can cut down on drying time and reduce the risk of heat damage. Comb a protective serum through your hair before blow-drying. If you’re trying to achieve a smooth and silky effect, use a boar bristle brush to gently pull your hair taut during blow drying. Dry from the roots of your hair down to the ends.  

comb your hair every morning.  use a flat iron.  blow-dry your hair. 

 Whatever your circumstances, there has to be one main, stand-out reason. Whether that person just isn't right for you or if you're just not ready, be honest with yourself and develop your own reasoning for not wanting to date. That way, you'll be in a good position to explain yourself and won't feel as if you have to give false reasons to accept or avoid dating.; , At some point in time, you may meet a person and think that you could possibly develop feelings for them as you're getting to know each other. Be honest with yourself about what you want, and whether or not you're ready to become emotionally intimate with another person. Either way, you can become friends with this person at a later point in time when you may be ready for a relationship.   You may find that the friendship you've shared so far will add depth and meaning to your relationship. But, if you do not intend or want it to ever blossom into an intimate relationship, that's okay, too. Being honest with that person about your expectations for the relationship and your intentions is the best thing you can do, but remember to use your words appropriately. Use the 'Golden Rule' when deciding how to tell someone you're not interested.  Sometimes you'll get that annoying question: "Why are you, or why do you choose to be single?" Be prepared to answer it in a way you feel comfortable with, but don't feel as though you have to answer in detail. Something simple like: "I want some time to discover myself," or "I don't need a relationship to be content," works fine, too. But not having even a simple explanation can make the interested person feel as though they have a fatal flaw. And even if that is the case, there's no reason to tear that person apart.  Spend time with friends and family or gain a new hobby/invest more time in a current one. You'll learn that you are capable of doing activities that you enjoy on your own.   When you are ready to date and get into a relationship, you'll have your own interests to keep you busy in your partner's absence, or you'll have a great passion to share with them. Remember that you are your own person!  , The bonus is that these people will likely share more interests with you; the downside is that you may feel compelled to connect romantically. However, there is no universal law saying that you must be in a relationship with someone you share interests with. Instead, take this opportunity to make some great friends and do some serious networking, especially if you see this hobby turning into a career path.  Being friendly and being flirty can sometimes be perceived as the same thing, but you should never let someone make you feel guilty or pressured into a relationship because they misread your signals. But also be clear to the interested person about your intentions at that point so that they cannot further misread your signals. If they continue to be persistent and you're not interested, it's probably time to ask yourself if the friendship is worth putting effort into.   If you find yourself in a situation where you've been asked on a date, and don't feel ready to, make it clear to the interested person that you don't want to be in a relationship. Turn them down politely, with a legitimate reason, otherwise you risk hurting their feelings--especially if you want to be friends. Or, instead of declining a date for the two of you, you could suggest inviting friends to join your activity together. Be clear though that it is not a date, and make sure the interested person understands your intentions.  If they like you as a person, then nothing should have changed in your relationship. If they get mad or upset with you, remember; it's not your fault! Try leaving them alone for a few days so that they can cool off. If they care for you and understand you, they will not let it affect your friendship. Try not to scared away easily. You can still remain friends after turning someone down, but you should always be sensitive to whether or not the other person is willing to continue the friendship, despite their intimate feelings towards you.   Don't pressure them or make them feel guilty about maintaining the friendship if they are uncomfortable with only remaining friends. If you sense a person is starting to take an interest in you, make sure that you are clear from the start that nothing more than a friendship will be possible. Do not lead them on to stroke your own ego because that can definitely hurt any chances of remaining friends. But don't apologize for being friendly either. Some people may misinterpret friendly behavior as interest, which is why it's important to be clear about your intentions using both verbal language and body language. Don't stay friends with people who persistently ask you out if you don't feel ready. If you remain friends with such people, you are likely going to end up committing yourself or hurting the other person.  It's okay if dating isn't number one in your priority list. Just have fun and enjoy life to the fullest. Sometimes it's great to be single!  , You of all people know what you're ready for, and feeling pressured to find a mate can be emotionally draining. Tell your close friends and family members about your choice to stay single and your reasoning behind it so that they don't continue to harass you. Otherwise, those people may assume to know your reasoning, which can complicate things even further.  If you had a traumatic experience that has influenced your choice to stay single, do not bear the weight of that incident alone. Reach out to trusted family and friends to help you work through what happened, and/or see a therapist or psychiatrist. Keeping a private journal can also help you work through the experience and overcome it, but do not be fooled: unresolved traumatic experiences can fester over time and create new or worsening problems like anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Do some research to find the best options for your recovery so that you can live a more enjoyable and peaceful life.  Don't forget that there are three outcomes to any intimate relationship: marriage, long-term commitment, or a breakup. Don't date unless you feel prepared for any of the above scenarios. Don't let society's expectations (or your mom's opinion) make you feel like you're a weirdo for wanting some time to date yourself. Embrace your freedom!  , If you are in a relationship where you are friends with someone but they want to date you, just remember that if you don't want to date them keep it in the friend zone. If they are truly your friend, they will understand. If you have been asked to date but you don't want to, tell them you'd rather be friends for now and not jump into things so quickly.   Let them decide whether they want to keep you in the friend-zone until you're ready or whether they find it better to go their separate ways. Whatever they choose, have knowledge in the fact that you were honest with them from the very beginning. Appreciate their decision just as they will hopefully respect yours and don't forget that if they truly like you, they will wait until you are ready. After all, if they don't wait, it's their loss!  

know why you're not keen on dating.  be open and honest with yourself.  practice your answers.  keep yourself busy so you don't feel pressured to fill that gap of social interaction with a romantic interest.  be aware that, while increasing participation in a hobby, you may come into contact with a new group of potential mates.  be friendly but firm about your boundaries.  stay friends, if possible.  spend more time with your friends.  don't let others make you feel guilty about not being ready to date.  reach out for help if you need it.  deal constructively with expectations from others.  take it slow.

 Likely you will be working in a zoo, a safari park, or working as part of a volunteer program looking after abandoned tigers in India or similar place. You might be a zookeeper, a zoo or safari volunteer, a guide explaining this to visitors, or a vet. If you are a vet, please improve this article. You can skip this step if you are just writing a biology paper at university.; , Female tigers are not sexually mature until they are around 3 or 4 years of age, but usually come into season around 2 1/2 years of age., She is leaving her scent marks via strong pheromones in her urine so that male tigers know that she has gone into oestrus. The tigress will become vocal. She will roar (which tigers do not do that often) in order to attract a mate. Tigers live far away from one another, so roaring is a signal to come nearer. "Vocalisations can be persistent and one female was recorded as roaring 69 times in only 15 minutes."She will not be averse to visiting male tigers. Although usually loners, tigers drop such reserve at mating time. A male tiger's territory usually covers that of several females and although the initial meeting might result in a fight, once they have checked each other out, the mating begins.  Given the sad reality that there are fewer and fewer tigers in the world yearly, oestrus may come and go before the female finds a male to mate with. If she does find one, and all going well they get along, the female tiger will adopt the lordosis position for mating and the male tiger will mount her, bite the back of her neck and mate. This process causes pain to the female tiger, which stimulates ovulation.  

be in charge of a tigress.  wait for the tigress to be the right age.  look for the signs of the tigress coming into heat:  she will start rubbing up against things as domestic female cats do.  expect mating if a mate can be found.

 To help you work this out, here are some of the key features of each type of saw:    Electric chainsaws: These are lighter, don't require fuel, do not require cranking, and are cleaner than gasoline saws. They do, however, have limits as to how large a log they can cut, and require access to electric power to operate.  Battery operated chainsaws: These do not require close access to electrical outlets, but have limited run time and significantly less power than other types. They are best for light trimming or cutting small branches.  Gasoline chainsaws: These have the most power. They range from 27cc's to over 150, suitable for cutting anything from small branches to large trees. They can be temperamental and will require you to mix fuel.  Hydraulic chainsaws: These are used for clearing limbs from power lines and even cutting underwater, but generally, they are niche tools, and since they require a remote motor to provide hydraulic power, they are not suitable for most users.; , Small jobs can be done with 12 inch (30cm) bars, and either the battery, electric, or gasoline saw, so the choice is yours which to buy.  Homelite and Poulan saws, for example, are inexpensive, and work well for most small projects. They may not hold up as well for serious cutting jobs though, in which case, spending more money on a Husqvarna, Stihl, Echo, or Jonsered saw is a better investment.  No matter what brand you choose, you will eventually need parts and service, so buying a chainsaw that offers locally provided servicing and parts is a good choice.  Nothing beats experienced advice when making a choice.  Here are some examples:   What kind of blade does the chainsaw have? There are straight blades, bow blades, different cutter size chains, and special chains for ripping, carving, and other jobs. Select the safety features you think are important. Most chainsaws have chain brakes; however, if you buy a used chainsaw, this feature may not be available on your model. Anti- kickback bars are another feature you may want. Spark arrest mufflers and tip guards are also common on modern chainsaws.  A diminutive person wouldn't really want to handle a 165cc Stihl chainsaw with a 36" blade. These weigh in at over 45 pounds.  New chainsaws have the advantage of a manufacturer's warranty, but used chainsaws can be less than half the cost. Check what you can of the seller's background if buying the chainsaw used, such as looking at auction site feedback. , Look for sales, promotions, and other things that effect the price of the chainsaw.  eBay and Craigslist often have listings for used (and sometimes new) saws. Be aware you won't be able to test run a chainsaw bought and shipped to your location. You might ask ahead if returns are appropriate should the chainsaw prove unworkable for your needs.  You will need fuel (or extension cords), chain lubricant, tools to sharpen and adjust the chain, and safety gear to wear while operating the tool. 

decide whether an electric, battery operated, gasoline, or hydraulic chainsaw is the right one for your needs.  decide on the size and chain configuration you will need.  every brand has unique features and characteristics.  find out what your local dealers can sell and service.  ask friends and neighbors who use a chainsaw what they think of the available brands.  choose specific features that are important to you.  consider the weight of the chainsaw.  decide on new or used.  look in the phone book, or visit stores with a hardware section to see what they offer.  ,  compare prices.  check online sales sites for used chainsaws.  remember, buying a saw is only the first step.  consider buying an extra chain, since a chain can become dull or break during use, causing you to lose time.

 While aloe vera gels and sprays are available, using the pulp directly from a leaf offers the best results. Dab it onto the affected area and let sit for a half hour or more, then rinse with cool water. Repeat if necessary or desired.If you go with a store bought product, check its label for alcohol. Avoid using alcohol-based products as they will dry out your skin, causing further irritation.  Consider using tea tree oil either on its own or blended with a skin product. Apply enough oil to saturate the the area you shaved immediately after hair removal. You can also add several drops of tea tree oil to the moisturizer or balm you use after shaving. Some people are sensitive to tea tree oil, so you might want to dilute it before applying. Mix a half teaspoon of it with three tablespoons of olive oil. Diluting with essential oils is not recommended., Rub a small amount of coconut oil onto your irritated skin. If you’re not planning on rinsing, use an amount small enough for your skin to absorb. Alternatively, you can apply a thin coating, leave it on for about a half hour, then rinse with lukewarm water.If you leave coconut oil on your skin, be careful about coming into contact with clothes or furniture fabric, since it can leave tough to remove stains., Apply directly to your skin and let it sit for about ten minutes.

 If you don't have Excel installed on your computer, you can use Outlook's online Excel extension in its place. You may need to create an Outlook account first.; , This will open a new Excel spreadsheet.  This will go in the "A" column. To do so, you should first click and drag the divider between columns "A" and "B" to the right at least three spaces so you don't run out of writing room. You will need eight cells total for the following categories:   Loan Amount $ Annual Interest Rate Life Loan (in years) Number of Payments per Year Total Number of Payments Payment per Period Sum of Payments Interest Cost  , These will go in your "B" column, directly to the right of the "Categories" column. You'll need to enter the appropriate values for your mortgage.   Your Loan Amount value is the total amount you owe. Your Annual Interest Rate value is the percentage of interest that accrues each year. Your Life Loan value is the amount of time you have in years to pay off the loan. Your Number of Payments per Year value is how many times you make a payment in one year. Your Total Number of Payments value is the Life Loan value multiplied by the Payments Per Year value. Your Payment per Period value is the amount you pay per payment. Your Sum of Payments value covers the total cost of the loan. Your Interest Cost value determines the total cost of the interest over the course of the Life Loan value.  Since this is your Life Loan value multiplied by your Payments Per Year value, you don't need a formula to calculate this value.   For example, if you make a payment a month on a 30-year life loan, you would type in "360" here.  To figure out how much you must pay on the mortgage each month, use the following formula: "= -PMT(Interest Rate/Payments per Year,Total Number of Payments,Loan Amount,0)".   For the provided screenshot, the formula is "-PMT(B6/B8,B9,B5,0)". If your values are slightly different, input them with the appropriate cell numbers. The reason you can put a minus sign in front of PMT is because PMT returns the amount to be deducted from the amount owed.  To do this, simply multiply your "payment per period" value by your "total number of payments" value.   For example, if you make 360 payments of $600.00, your total cost of the loan would be $216.000.  All you need to do here is subtract your initial loan amount from the total cost of your loan that you calculated above. Once you've done that, your mortgage calculator is complete.  

open microsoft excel.  select blank workbook.  create your "categories" column.  enter your values.  figure out the total number of payments.  calculate the monthly payment.  calculate the total cost of the loan.  calculate the total interest cost. 

 However, a six-foot high chain-link fence, with two-by-two inch mesh can be effective at keeping cats out of your yard. A two-foot overhang can provide additional protection.  When a cat walks by, the motion triggers the sprinkler, which sprays a burst of water. Most cats do not like getting wet, so this can often be an effective deterrent. Use motion-activated sprinklers to create a border around your yard or areas of it that you do not want cats to use as a litter box.   These sprinklers can be installed either permanently or temporarily, depending on your preference and needs.  These emit a high-frequency sound that cats detest, but which humans cannot hear.These devices are motion-activated, so that when a cat walks by, it is startled by the high-frequency sound and should leave the area. Look for ultrasonic devices at a pet supply store, and use them to create a barrier around your yard or sections of it that you do not want cats using as a litter box.  As long as it is low-voltage, it will not harm the cats, only drive them away. The fence can be raised about 4 inches from the ground and still discourage them from using your yard as a litter box. .   Look for electric fencing at hardware or home supply stores. Carefully follow all installation and safety instructions. Keep children away from electric fencing.  Cats can be trained, so if you are persistent, this may eventually be enough to permanently discourage them from using your yard.   Be gentle when you are spraying cats with a water hose. Most cats do not like water, so a quick, gentle squirt is usually enough—there is no need for high-powered nozzles, or to thoroughly soak the intruding cats.  Cats will not linger in areas they do not feel are safe from predators. For this reason, a dog that chases cats can effectively keep them from using your yard as a litter box.

 The gemstone is not quite as valuable as pearl and does not appear in chain store jewelers frequently, but small jewelers and online merchants are more likely to sell it. Buying amber in person is preferable to buying online, though, since fake amber is commonly sold as the real deal and is easier to check if purchased in person.   If you do buy amber online, only buy from trusted, certified merchants who have a decent return policy.  Amber is made from fossilized pine tree resin and usually has a rich golden honey or light brown hue, but one shade is not necessarily better than another. Blue amber even exists, but since it is quite rare, it tends to be expensive.  Amber is not a gemstone that is meant to look smooth. In fact, some of the most valuable and expensive pieces contain inclusions of insects, plants, or pyrites. The inclusions and veins found in amber give it more character and do not ruin the quality or durability of the stone.  Amber floats in salt water, but plastics meant to mimic amber usually sink. If you buy the amber as loose gemstones instead of in a solid piece of jewelry, the float test is a good way to test for fakes.  Heat a needle and gently touch the needle to the bottom of the stone. Real amber will give off the scent of pine when heated. Fake amber will usually smell acidic or otherwise unpleasant.  Wipe a cotton swab dabbed in acetone over the amber gemstone. Real amber will feel the same way before and after, but a fake will feel soft and sticky afterward.  

use caution when shopping for amber.  consider the color.  expect to see veins and inclusions.  do a float test on the amber.  perform a hot needle test.  test the amber with nail polish remover containing acetone. 

 The first person point of view has two different tenses, present tense and past tense. Present tense “I” focuses on the actions and thoughts of the narrator as they unfold in the present. It can be a good option for moving the story forward, carrying the reader through a narrative as events and moments are happening.For example, a first person present tense narrator would be, “I open the window and yell at him to leave me alone. I close the window and try to focus on the latest soap opera on television.”; , The past tense is a good option if you are writing a story that explores the main character or narrator’s past. It is a more popular tense than present tense and is often easier to do. Writing in the past tense can make the story feel more like it is being told, rather than happening in the present moment.For example, a first person past tense narrator would be, “I opened the window and yelled at him to leave me alone. I closed the window and tried to focus on the latest soap opera on television.”  , In most cases, the first person point of view is not recommended for an academic essay. But your instructor may allow you use the first person when discussing a work of literature or a scholarly work. Use the present tense to give the discussion immediacy and an intimate tone.If you are using APA style, you can use the first person point of view to discuss your research steps in a research paper. For example, you may write, “I studied sample A” or “I interviewed subject B.” In general, you should avoid the first person point of view and only use it sparingly in your research paper.  

use present tense to move the story forward.  try past tense to explore a character’s past.  go for present tense when discussing the work.

 If you are keeping your clothes in a container overnight, you can help them stay smelling good by just using a bar of soap. Carefully fold your clothes into the container, and then place a breathable cloth, such as a napkin or a thin tablecloth, over the top of the clothes. Get a sweet-smelling soap bar that you like, and place this on top of the breathable cloth.   Put the lid back on the container, and leave it. The clothes should have absorbed the smell of the soap after around four hours. Try out a few different soaps to see which one you like the most. Lavender and lemon are good choices to start with.You could repeat this method with a drawer rather than a storage container.  Making a small sachet or a nice smelling herb and adding to the container or draw where you store your clothes overnight will help you wake up to fresh smelling clothes. You can buy small sachets of potpourri, but you can also make your own at home. Get a few small cotton bags that are breathable.   Then fill them will dried herbs that you like the smell of, and put them in the drawer or container. Lavender is a popular choice, and you can also try lemongrass.Experiment with some different scents to find the one that works best for you.  Dryer sheets are a tried and tested way to keep clothes smelling nice and fresh when they are being stored. If you have a big drawer or container full of clothes add a dryer sheet between each layer to help keep them fresh and smelling good.You can also just place one dryer sheet at the bottom of each drawer or container. Adding a dryer sheet to your suitcase is also great for keeping clothes fresh when travelling., You could opt for getting especially designer drawer liners to help keep clothes fresh overnight. These work in the same way as the dryer sheets, but they are generally scented and designed to last for longer. You will find these in department and homeware stores, and they come in a range of fragrances. 

use a soap bar.  use herb sachets.  try dryer sheets.  consider draw liners. 

 Each state and country has different laws pertaining to legal responsibilities and requirements that come with being a boxing promoter. Find out what the laws are in your area by visiting the website of the appropriate boxing commission.   Most US states (and some cities) have their own commissions. The Association of Boxing Commissions provides a contact list of most of the boxing commissions in North America (and beyond).In states that don't have a commission dedicated to combat sports, you'll need to do your research on the state government's website to find pertinent laws. Make sure to develop a complete understanding of laws in your area. Violating laws can leave you open to lawsuits and/or a revocation of your license.; , Complete the application, which includes information about your business affairs, experience in the area of boxing, and any personal associations with members of the boxing commission board, contestants, judges or other officials who may be involved in a boxing match.   While state boxing promoter license applications vary, many require that the promoter provide information about their business entity and complete names and contact information for the business itself and its board members or partners.Promoters may be asked about their business' financial history including recent bankruptcy filings and financial interest in any boxing contestants. A promoter's license application may also request information about the promoter's involvement in any investigations regarding event promotions or if the promoter has any history of criminal convictions.  In most states you will need to pay a small fee when you submit your initial application. This fee is for processing the application itself, and is usually about $50.   If your application is granted, you may be required to pay a substantially larger fee for the license. In Nevada, this fee is $500.In Minnesota, it's $700., Wait for commission to approve your application. In most cases, you will be notified by mail as to their decisions.   In some states, such as Nevada, you are required to attend a hearing by the commission on the day your application is discussed to answer any questions they may have that are not covered on the application. 

research local laws.  apply for a promoters license.  pay the fees.  await approval. 

 The classic treasure hunt clue is a simple couplet, or rhyming lines. These can be easy, like "To find your first clue, look by the glue," or more opaque, such as "We travel together, one black and one white, you only meet us when the food isn't right" (by the salt and pepper)., Draw or take photos of places they should investigate, figuring out where the actual location is. This is a great clue for younger kids, as it lets them get moving quickly. For the older crowd, you can up the ante by using vintage photos, satellite shots, or extreme close-ups for a more difficult hunt., For example, you could get three identical cups. Show the kids which cup you are hiding the clue under, then rapidly mix around the cups. The kids then have to guess which cup contains the clue. You can run egg races, small obstacle courses, or mini scavenger hunts as well, giving out the clue only once the game is complete.This can be a good way to break up the middle of a hunt. Send them off on the first 4-5 clues, then go set up the game for the middle. After the game is over, they can get some food, water, and sunblock before hitting the next 4-5 clues.  The simplest way to make invisible ink is to write something in white crayon, then have the kids go over it with highlighter. You can also make invisible ink, letting the kids figure out what to do with the "blank" clue on their own.For kids of all ages, you could turn all of the lights off in a room so it is pitch black. Tell the kids to search for the clues with flashlights or by feeling around.  You might dunk the clues in a bowl of wet spaghetti "brains," forcing kids to go dig through. If you have some waterproof clues, you can put them in the bottom of the pool, giving kids a chance to jump in and swim (as long as they are supervised). Anything that makes them move and try out different things will be a blast., For example, you can get custom-made puzzles cheaply online, which you can print with a clue. Then, at each smaller clue, you give out a puzzle piece, which build up to reveal one last clue or secret. Other ideas include:   Giving out letters at each clue as part of a word scramble. The scrambled word is a password for another clue, or the answer to reveal the final treasure. Themed questions such as -- "the final answer is the one thing all the other clues have in common," or "the final clue comes from the first letter of all the other clues."  , This is especially fun if you have a themed treasure hunt. For example, you can ask "Where part of the house did Harry Potter have to live in as a kid?" which would send the children scrambling towards the closet for the next clue.   Be sure to check with some kids beforehand, so that these clues are actually relevant or answerable!, This goes well with puzzles or multi-part clues. Write out a map, complete with illustrations and a few intentionally misleading parts (like an "accidentally" erased area). Then, at each location in the map, put a small prize or clue needed to open the final treasure, which prevents kids from racing straight to the end. 

make rhyming clues and riddles.  use pictures as clues.  incorporate games into some of the clues.  use secret codes or invisible ink to make the clues a little more challenging.  hide the clues in something "gross" or fun to explore.  consider multi-part clues for older treasure hunters.  incorporate age-appropriate trivia, including popular characters and songs.  use a map instead of classic "clues." 

 They will be able to provide accommodations and services. Requirements vary by school, but you will usually need documentation from a doctor or mental health professional. At some point you will fill out a form regarding your needs.   Some disability centers will email your professor(s) or give you an accommodation letter to show them.The letter or email won't share the name of your disability; it'll just explain your needs and how they will be accommodated.; , This way, they can get you a detailed, thorough accommodation letter.If you're going to miss classes, your professor should know that it's because of illness instead of laziness. If you need quiet to focus in the classroom, sometimes have to eat in class, or may get sensory overload and need to leave, those are all things your professors should know. This allows them to better accommodate you and be understanding.   When in doubt, ask for the accommodation. You can always choose not to use it, and it's better to play it safe in case you need it after all.  You can do this by finding their email on the syllabus or class website, and sending them a brief email. Do this early on, so there's plenty of time to meet. Try to set up the meeting sometime after the first class session.   For example, "Hi, I'm ____ and I'm a student in your _____ class. I would like to meet during the first week of class to discuss my disability." If you are nervous about your tone, try asking a friend to review it for you or running it through a tone-analyzing website.If you are not comfortable emailing, you can approach the professor after class to set up a meeting.  Read the syllabus, and listen to the goals the professor talks about during the first day of class. What will be easy for you? What might be more difficult? What potential problems could arise?   You can talk to the professor about the potential problems. For example, "I struggle a lot with time management, and completing a big essay in three weeks could be hard. Would you be able to help me break it up into smaller steps when the time comes?" Try coming up with solutions to a problem, knowing that you can brainstorm more with the professor. For example, "I get sick very easily, so I might get more than 4 absences. If this happens, how could I make up for it? What if I wrote one page on the textbook reading as my participation?"  , It may be helpful to write a few main points on a notecard, so you can mentally check them off as you discuss each one in conversation. This way, you won't forget to tell the professor anything important.  The school disability center may have assigned you a case manager, and there may be other people in the office who could assist you. Explain that you're nervous about talking to the professor, and would like someone to come with you to help.   You will probably do most of the talking, and the person will be there to support you and help out with any potential issues that arise.  Treat the professor with the assumption that they are a reasonable person who wants to help you. Most people will rise to your expectations and be happy to help you succeed. Set an optimistic, problem-solving tone, and they will probably follow your lead.   Don't feel the need to be ashamed or apologetic. It's perfectly natural and reasonable to want your needs met. Remember, your professor wants you to succeed. Your accommodations and rights are a fact of life.You don't need to defend them; the professor is already on board. You're simply here to discuss how to make things work.  Tell them the basics of your disability, especially how it relates to your performance in class. You may tell them that you're autistic if you feel comfortable, or stick with the generic "I have a disability." Either way, be prepared to elaborate on what it means.   "Hi, I'm Emma. I have a disability that affects my body language and study skills. I'm getting testing accommodations, and I may need extra help understanding assignment instructions. Fidgeting helps me pay attention, so don't worry if you see me doing it in class." "Good morning! I'm Jamal. I came to you because I'm autistic, and I want to make sure that I can do well in your class. Time management and staying organized can be difficult for me, and I want to do my best."  , Your research from before, and your time at the disability office, will have helped you figure out your greatest needs. If you have an accommodation letter, give it to them and use it as a guide. Ask for the things you think you'll need. (Remember, you can always change your accommodations as you adjust to the class and its pace!)   "I've signed up with the disability center, and will take my tests there in a separate room. Also, I have issues with my blood sugar and may need to eat small snacks in class." "I can't sit still and listen at the same time. You might see me sitting in weird positions or fidgeting with things to help me focus. Sometimes I need a chair cushion or an alternate chair." "I have visual processing issues that make it hard for me to read quickly. It would help if I sat in the front, and could get copies of the notes or Power Points."  , Be prepared to field questions and explain some details. Be honest, and focus on what your needs are and how the professor can help. They may also have great ideas for how to accommodate you and make your life easier.   Brainstorm solutions to potential problems together. Work with your professor to be a problem-solving team.  If your professor is not used to accommodating disabled students, they may find it helpful to talk to the disability services office. It can be helpful to know a few good autism resources in case they wish to learn more about your disability.   Feel free to share wikiHow articles with them. For example, the article How to Teach an Autistic College Student explains what to expect, and the article How to Recognize Autism Symptoms in Yourself describes what autism usually looks like in teens and adults. Steer them away from catastrophizing websites such as Autism Speaks, which may mislead and worry them., You can always come to their office hours later with questions or requests to change your accommodations. Give them your student email so they can contact you if they want to follow up.   End on a high note. For example, "Thanks for taking the time to talk this through with me. I look forward to your class. Bye!"  , Ask an understanding friend, family member, or therapist to pretend to be your professor. This can help you practice and gain confidence.   Pratt has some self-advocacy videos available, if you need extra guidance.  Make sure that you have showered, applied deodorant, and neatly groomed your hair. Wear comfortable, neat clothes. This gives the impression that you care.   If you have facial hair, make sure it is clean-shaven or well-groomed. You don't need to wear makeup in order to look good. Only put it on if you like it and feel confident wearing it. You can rock your look either way. If you feel uncertain about your ability to do this, ask a family member or friend to help you choose an outfit.  You can stim discreetly throughout the conversation to help you stay focused relaxed. The professor won't mind if you squeeze a stress ball or twirl a bracelet in your hand as you talk with them.   If the professor is curious about it, say "This helps me focus." If they ask, try showing it to them; they may think it's pretty cool! It's a good idea to have a box of stim toys in your dorm room. You can grab one or two whenever you go out.  Say "please" and "thank you," and listen without interrupting as your professor speaks. Do your best to use a pleasant facial expression and tone of voice. Assume the best, and see if you and the professor can work together as a team.    Use "I" statements to phrase your needs. Try the template "If/When ____, I ____" (for example, "When there is a lot of chatter in a room, I have a hard time focusing.") If for some reason the conversation goes badly, don't turn defensive or demanding. Instead, say "I don't think we can have a productive conversation right now. I'm going to leave. Thanks for your time." Then go to student disability services and explain what happened. They will help you., You can show that you are attentive by looking at the professor when they talk, and periodically nodding or saying things like "All right" and "I see." When you have a question, ask it. Showing non-autistic people that you're listening isn't a mysterious art; it's simply a matter of learning and implementing a pattern.   You don't need to make eye contact in order to show that you're listening. Try looking at their eyebrows, nose, mouth, chin, or shirt. (Keep your focus near the top of their face if they are wearing a low-cut shirt.)  , You'll want to give the professor time to absorb what you say, and to speak up if they have any questions or thoughts. You don't need to rush the conversation.   If you talk very quickly when you're nervous, take a deep breath. Say "Sorry. I tend to talk quickly when I'm nervous. I'm trying to slow down." The professor will understand, and may reassure you.  Autistic people are often pathologized and underestimated,and this can make it easy to discount your strengths. You can hold a good conversation and be autistic at the same time. You've got this.  

register with your school's disability services center.  talk to disability services in detail about your needs.  set up a meeting with your professor before the semester starts.  figure out the course goals.  jot down notes if you want to make sure you remember everything.  ask someone to come with you if you are nervous.  assume the best.  explain to the professor why you are coming to them.  discuss any accommodations you are getting, and any more you might need.  make time for dialogue.  offer more resources if they are uncertain or interested in learning more.  thank the professor for their time, and assure them you'll keep communication lines open.  try doing a role-play practice session.  be clean and well-dressed.  bring a good stim toy, if you use one.  be polite and respectful.  brush up on your listening skills.  allow pauses in the conversation.  recognize that you are more skilled than you realize. 

 Set the dish aside.  Fill a large pot with about 4 quarts (3.79 liters) of water and add 2 teaspoons of salt. Bring the water to a boil, then add the macaroni. Cook the macaroni for 5 to 7 minutes, or until just about done.  Place a large strainer or colander into the sink, and dump the macaroni into it. Shake the strainer a little to get rid of excess water, then add 2 tablespoons of butter. Stir the macaroni to spread the butter evenly, then set it aside.  Pour the milk into a saucepan and add the garlic, bay leaf, thyme, and mustard. Cut a medium-sized onion in half, stick a clove into it, and add it into the milk as well. Cook the milk until it starts to steam, stirring occasionally.   Save the other half of the onion for another recipe.  This will allow the flavors to continue to mix and fuse while you prepare the roux.  Add 2 tablespoons of butter and the flour into a pot. Cook it over medium heat for about 2 to 3 minutes, stirring often. Don't let it change color or turn golden-brown.   Make sure that the pot is big enough to hold the milk mixture. You will be straining the milk into this.  Hold a strainer over the pot with the roux in it. Pour the milk through it, and stir the milk mixture briskly to avoid lumps. Discard the onion, garlic, and herbs.  This will take about 5 minutes. Be sure to stir the sauce often so that it doesn't scorch or stick to the bottom of the pan.  The cheese should melt into a smooth consistency. Save the rest of the cheese and the cheddar chunks for later.  Give the sauce a taste, and add some salt and pepper if needed. How much you add depends entirely on your personal preferences.  Keep stirring until the sauce coats the macaroni evenly and the cheddar chunks are mostly melted.  To make the flavor more consistent, mix the remaining cheeses in a large bowl first, then spread them evenly across the top of the macaroni. Do not stir.  When the macaroni is done, pull it out of the oven using oven mitts or potholders.  Cover and store any leftovers. You can reheat them again in the microwave the next day. 

preheat the oven to 350°f (176°c) and lightly coat a 2-quart (1.89 liters) casserole dish with 1 tablespoon of butter.  cook the macaroni in a large pot of boiling salted water until done, about 5 to 7 minutes.  drain the water and toss the macaroni with 2 tablespoons butter.  cook the milk with the herbs over medium-low heat until it starts to steam, about 10 minutes.  remove the milk from heat once it starts to steam and set it aside.  prepare the roux.  strain the milk onto the roux and keep whisking to avoid lumps.  continue cooking the sauce over medium heat until it thickens, then remove it from heat.  stir in half of the grated cheddar and half of the parmesan.  add some salt and pepper to taste.  pour the mixture over the macaroni, add the chunks of cheddar, and stir everything together.  spoon the macaroni into the a baking dish and sprinkle the remaining cheeses on top.  bake the macaroni for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the top is golden and crusty.  let the macaroni and cheese cool for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.  finished.  

 Flipping a house for profit involves a number of costs, including the home down payment, mortgage, interest payments, property taxes, real estate closing costs, inspections, permits, and contractors' fees.These costs add up quickly, and the flipped house might not sell at a profit. Before you decide whether to go ahead with flipping a house, you should ask yourself:   What will you do if the house does not sell right away? Would it be possible to use the house as a rental property, for example?If you do not have a reasonable back-up plan if something goes wrong with the sale of the flipped house, you might want to reevaluate your plans. Are the potential profits worth the risk of a considerable loss? In 2015, houses priced below $50,000, saw negative returns. On the other hand, homes priced at $100,000 – $200,000, yielded an average gross return of 44%.Keep in mind that selling a house in which you have never lived might also involve heavy tax payments, which can lower your profit margin considerably.Can your investment partners weather the risk of a potential loss? Have you done your research on local real estate markets, remodeling costs, and permits? In order to have a successful house-flipping experience, you have to educate yourself on local home prices, school districts, responsible contractors, and real estate regulations.; , Sweat equity refers to the amount of value you might add to your home due to your own labor.For example, if you are a skilled roofer or licensed plumber, perhaps you can undertake some of the home repairs yourself. This will cut down on your overhead and reduce the amount of money you have to borrow.   Be sure that you take into account the amount of time you'll spend working on the flipped house. Your time also has value, and flipping a house can sometimes take months of work.Consider whether other ways of spending your time might be more lucrative or more enjoyable. More importantly, will the partners putting up the financial stake consider that your sweat equity has any value? If so, how much value compared to their hard cash? Be sure to adhere to all local regulations when you undertake home repairs yourself. Discuss your plans with a real estate attorney or local regulations board if you require approval for any construction or repairs.  If you do not have money for a flipped house yourself, you will need to take out a loan to cover your initial costs. No matter who your lender is — a partner, a bank, or a private lender — you will have to demonstrate that you have the capability of repaying your loan. Your credit score reflects your credit history, your ability to pay off your loans, and your overall debt load. The better your credit score, the better the chances that you will be able to secure a loan at an affordable interest rate.   There are a few different credit rating systems, but in general your credit score will be a number somewhere between 300-850.The higher your score, the better your credit is. You can get a free report with your credit score every 12 months by visiting https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action .  If your credit score is too low for you to be able to secure loans for a house-flipping venture, you might want to take some time to improve your credit score. This can take some time, but it might be worthwhile in the long run. Moreover, the better your credit score is, the more likely it is that you will be able to weather a potential loss from house-flipping. To improve your credit score you can:   Pay off your debts in a timely way. If you do not have a good history of paying off your debt, you will not be able to secure a decent loan for a flipped house.Keep your overall debt load to a minimum. Avoid maintaining a credit card balance if you can.Only have credit lines when absolutely necessary. Do not have more credit cards than you require for your day-to-day life.Protect your identity. Monitor your credit card transactions and your credit rating to make sure that your identity has not been stolen by a thief or a hacker. Take reasonable security precautions to protect your information. For example, do not log into your online banking system unless you are on a secure, password-protected network., A financial advisor will be able to look at your current financial situation and help you determine how much risk you can afford to take on as part of a house-flipping investment. A financial advisor might also be able to help you come up with a plan for meeting your expenses even if your flipped house takes a long time to sell or requires extra repairs.  In order to flip a house successfully, you will have to make your decisions based on logic and research, not on your emotions. Before you begin the process of finding a lender and purchasing a house, it is wise for you to have a solid business plan in place. This plan should keep you on the right track for making a wise investment as well as provide confidence to your potential lenders and partners that you can make a profit. Your business plan should include:   A maximum purchase price of the home that you will flip. A list of in-demand neighborhoods where you will target your search. Pay particular attention to school districts, neighborhood safety, and proximity to amenities such as shops and public transit.A maximum cost of repairs and remodels that you can afford. A list of dependable, affordable, licensed contractors who can undertake repairs successfully. A reasonable estimate for the After Repair Value (ARV) of the flipped home. Ideally, the initial sales price will be no more than 70% of the home's ARV.A sense of who your buyer is and what they want. Will your buyer likely be a retired couple? A young businessperson? A couple with children? Depending on the neighborhood, your potential buyers might want very different things out of a home. Consider who your likely buyer will be and what they might need out of their house. For example, if you are looking at flipping a home in a neighborhood with a great school district, you might consider a remodel that has young children in mind.A specific buyer. In some cases, you might be able to line up a buyer before you flip the house. In this case, your risks are much lower as are your overhead costs.A plan for how to repay your loan if something goes wrong. Do not flip a house unless you can meet your expenses, even if something were to go wrong with your sale. For example, you might have a buyer fall through, or you might discover a problem with the foundation of the home. Build in a margin for error in your business plan, and brainstorm possible ways to weather a delay in the sale of the home or unexpected expenses.  

evaluate your tolerance for risk.  consider your ability to provide "sweat equity," and the value of that work.  know your credit score.  improve your credit score.  talk to a financial advisor.  make a business plan. 

 Your base should have only one entrance, and must be blocked by the initial Altar of Kings, Barracks and two Farms. You should then build an Arcane Tower in a position where it can access all your peasants but also has a reasonable range to hit enemy units on the outskirts. Every other farm should either be built in a scouting position around the map, to protect towers, or in front of your Altar, as it is your most fragile, exposed building. Every other building, the Arcane Vault, Arcane Sanctums, etc, should be built at the back of your base or they risk destruction. It is recommended to put the Arcane Vault near your entrance, so you can swiftly access potions and such when you need them.; , Less footmen allow for faster Arcane Sanctums, keep that in mind. Get a Beastmaster as your second hero as soon as you hit Tier Two and construct your Two Arcane Sanctums.  Assault his buildings that are being constructed. Delaying him will prevent him from getting the counter-units for your double Arcane Sanctum assault. It is okay to use your Town Portal here, as you will not need it if you do everything correctly.  Reach 48 food with footmen, sorceresses and priests in a 2:1 ratio. Pick up a scroll of healing and a scroll of protection if he does not have adept spirit walkers, reach level 3 with your Archmage, pick up three ivory towers and assault the orc base. Bring six militia and construct a lumber mill with the remaining two peasants while you head to the orcish base.  Upgrade all towers into guard towers. The militia have now reverted back into peasants, so order two of them to build two scout towers, and set the remaining four on Auto-Repair.  Micromanagement will determine the winner now. The orc is likely to bring his peons to aid him--ignore them as they deal very little damage. Your guard towers will go up and the Orc player will be overrun shortly after.  

have a perfect base.  train an archmage, five to seven footmen--depending on personal preference and the game situation.  head to the orc base with the archmage, beastmaster and footmen.  if all goes well, your second attack should be fatal.  lay out the towers just out of the range of the orc burrows, but within distance of his stronghold.  the orc should arrive shortly. 

 If your child is sad, you're probably feeling concerned. Sad children may cry, pout, act disengaged, or generally act abnormal, which can be very alarming to a parent. There are many reasons why your child might be sad, so start by asking your child about what's bothering him.   Don't shy away from talking about troubling situations. If there's a death, divorce, or separation in the family, acknowledge it and answer any questions your child might have.Some children have a hard time putting their feelings into words. Be patient, and keep asking until you get a sense of what's wrong. If your child doesn't know how to talk about what's wrong, use a game of 20-questions (with "warmer" or "colder" responses) to narrow down what's bothering him.If you suspect you know why your child is sad, ask prompting questions to get him to talk about it. For example, you might say something like, "It sounds like you're sad that Timmy moved away," or "I bet it hurt your feelings when Billy wouldn't sit with you."; , If your child is experiencing something troubling, it's important to make him feel that his emotions are being validated. This starts with how you initiate conversations with your child and carries through to how you respond when he tells you what's wrong.   Let your child talk about whatever is bothering him. Even if it's something that's difficult for you to tell him about, it's important that you listen and respond honestly and affectionately.Never tell a child (or anyone, for that matter) to "snap out of it," "cheer up," or "pull yourself together." Saying these things can send a message to your child that his feelings don't matter.Similarly, never tell your child that his situation "isn't so bad" - that may be true from your adult perspective, but to your child, feeling abandoned by his friend at lunch could be a crushing loss. Recognize that many sad children also experience coexisting emotions, like anger or fear. Be patient and try to talk your child down if he's feeling scared or mad at someone.  Some children may not recognize that their parents get sad from time to time. Many parents try to hide their own negative emotions to protect their children - which is healthy to do sometimes, but not to the point that your child thinks you never feel sad.   Showing or talking about your own sadness can help your child realize that he isn't alone, and that it's okay to feel sad sometimes.Tell your child that it's okay to cry, and don't be afraid to cry in front of him sometimes. Shield him or move him away from other kids so that no one calls him a "crybaby." Talk about times when you've been sad, and let your child know that you cry sometimes too.  

ask him about his problems.  don't downplay how he's feeling.  talk about your own sad feelings. 

 Nothing is worse than having to run to the hardware store in the middle of a project. See the list of things you need below.; , Usually a soggy area of grass, but sometimes it is a geyser. , Not the whole pipe, just the section that is broken. Carefully remove the section of grass above the pipe, trying to keep it intact. Do this by cutting a circular section with the end of your shovel above where you are to dig then carefully lifting it off. Dig up the dirt above the bad pipe with a shovel (you will probably also need a hand trowel to dig up the dirt under the pipe). You will want to have at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) on each side of the break clear and enough room for you fist underneath the pipe. If the hole fills with water, you will either have to wait for it to dry or bail it out (the latter is recommended).  Get a hacksaw, PVC or metal pipe cutters (depending on what type of pipe you have, older sprinkler systems are usually metal, while newer ones tend to be PVC). Cut the broken section out so that you have clean, undamaged pipe on both sides.  It should probably be 1/2 " to 1" shorter to allow room for the connectors. Or you can buy a PVC fitting from most home improvement stores that has one pipe sliding inside an outer barrel with an O-ring inside. It will extend almost 3" in length. I have seen in stores 1/2" to 2 1/2" in diameter sizes. One end is a female slip and the other is a male that needs a coupling, elbow, or tee to connect to complete the repair.  Some water will come pouring out at first, you could try to catch it, but it is easier to bail it out. Once the water stops coming out, clean both ends with a rag.  If you are lucky enough to have PVC then you just put the PVC primer and glue on the outside of the pipe and inside of the straight connectors and slip them together. Work quickly because the glue sets fast. Then put the section you just glued in the gap you just created, repeating the gluing procedure. If you have metal pipes you will have to thread the outside of the pipe to fit the connectors rather than gluing them.  Turn the sprinklers back on and make sure it is sealed properly. 

buy supplies.  find the rupture.  turn off the sprinklers, if you don’t this could be a very hard task.  ,  dig up the pipe.  cut the pipe.  measure a new length of pipe that is just a bit shorter than the gap left by old pipe that you cut away.  clean the pipe.  fit the new section.  test the pipe.  if everything is fixed, cover up the hole and replace the grass you so carefully removed before.  

 This includes a transducer, computer, ultrasound gel and the object to image.   Gather all of your items at first so that you will not have to run around trying to find things. Wash your hands if they are dirty.; , This might be on a PC, laptop or a medical imaging computer. The software is where you will see the image.   Different machines have different techniques. Get to know your machine and where things are placed. There are many different softwares to run an ultrasound. For research purposes, MATLAB is very common.  Insert the transducer into the transducer port and lock it by turning the knob vertically. This locks the transducer into place. In order to remove the transducer, simply turn the knob horizontally and remove.   Freeze the screen on your program before you do this. Push a little harder or wiggle it around if the transducer does not go into the port perfectly.  Ultrasound gel is always used between the head of the probe and the object being imaged. The gel makes it easier to see the image.   Apply a gracious, half a centimeter thick layer over the top surface. There is never too much gel, only too little.  The gel might feel cold to the patient but does not do any harm. Unfreeze the frame on the computer once the transducer is touching the object.   Move the transducer around while looking at the image on the computer. Locate the place you want to take the image. Zeroing in on your focal point might take some time. Be sure to practice so that you can find what you are looking for faster.  Increase or decrease the brightness or contrast in order to obtain a clearer picture. Play around with the settings on your device. Some settings might be better to use than others; it really depends on what you are imaging.   You know that it is a good image if the focal point is in the middle of the frame and there is a good contrast between light and dark areas.  This is the same button you used to freeze the image before firing the transducer. Congrats! You created an ultrasound image!  , In order to save the image you took, find the save button and save the image onto a certain place on your computer for easy access later.   Patients might want a copy of their ultrasound. To to this, find the print button and send the image to a printer.  Look at the color differences.   Ultrasound is usually black and white. The white is solid tissues like bones because they reflect more light. The blacker area is less dense and can be liquids or lumen like a uterus.  Use a delicate wipe such as a tissue.   There are ultrasound tissues that you may buy which will provide minimal scratching on the head of the transducer. Wipe softly but firmly. Make sure all the gel is off before getting ready to store it.  This will help to protect anything that may accidentally fall on the head.   The top surface of the transducer is very soft and any scratch or spill might damage the quality of the image.  This includes a place that is safe from knocking the probe down.   The probe should always be cool and dry. If other people are sharing the probe, make sure they also know safe storage protocols.  

collect all the components to aquire an ultrasound image.  turn the machine on and load the software.  connect the transducer to the machine.  prepare the probe.  lightly press the transducer onto the surface of the tissue.  adjust the image.  freeze the image.  save the image.  interpret the image.  wipe the gel off of the transducer.  put the plastic cover back onto the transducer.  store in a safe place. 

 What you choose to make your carrier from should depend on personal tastes and what you have available. Obviously a very old t-shirt might be a bit too stretched out to be safe, but one that has been worn a few times should still be perfectly fine. /images/thumb/3/3f/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-1.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-1.jpg /images/thumb/3/3f/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-1.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-1.jpg          Cotton tees are a good choice because they are soft against the baby's skin and they tend to be more breathable. Be aware of your baby's skin, especially if it is very sensitive. Try to avoid using the hems of the t-shirts if possible. If you buy new tees be sure to wash them first, especially if they are dark or brightly colored as the dye can transfer.; , The yarn that you use should be strong enough to securely hold the loops together, plus support the weight of the baby. A yarn that will not stretch or pill is important for added security. /images/thumb/e/e9/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-2.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-2.jpg /images/thumb/e/e9/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-2.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-2.jpg          You have the option of using other materials such as twine here, but do cover it with something to prevent scratching or irritating the baby's skin. You can use an extra scrap of the discarded t-shirt parts to make a cover by simply snipping off a piece, folding it in half so that the raw edges are not showing and then tying it around the yarn or twine. This also can be done for pure aesthetic purposes as well.  All that you will need for this project are: three t-shirts, one piece of yarn and a pair of scissors. The t-shirts should be pre-washed if they are new and should be in your regular size or perhaps, one size up. /images/thumb/4/4b/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-3.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-3.jpg /images/thumb/4/4b/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-3.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-3.jpg          Do not think that you need to make the carrier too big, because the material will relax slightly and this will make the carrier too large for safety.  This will give you three fabric tubes. Save the top portions for other projects if you are so inclined. /images/thumb/8/8b/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-4.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-4.jpg /images/thumb/8/8b/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-4.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-4.jpg         , If you are standing over top of your workspace you should be looking at two oval (or circular) shapes very close together. /images/thumb/3/37/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-5.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-5.jpg /images/thumb/3/37/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-5.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-5.jpg          This is the step where the yarn will come in - gather the yarn around both tubes, going up and through the middle so that when they are tied the two form what will look like a figure eight. Tie the yarn several times so that it is very secure and then cut off the excess.  With your scissors cut from the top, left hand corner and then diagonally to the bottom right hand corner, but only through the top part of the tube. What you will end up with is a wide piece with two narrow flaps in front. /images/thumb/d/dc/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-6.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-6.jpg /images/thumb/d/dc/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-6.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-6.jpg          This may sound confusing at first, but it is really quite simple. With the tube laid flat you have a top and a bottom part. The bottom part will be the part which is laying on the surface you are working from. Only cut the top part diagonally across, cutting from top to bottom.  Let them fall to your waist. The tied section should form an X and this part will be on your back to help distribute weight and make the carrier more stable and more comfortable. /images/thumb/4/4d/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-7.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-7.jpg /images/thumb/4/4d/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-7.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-7.jpg         , /images/thumb/1/12/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-8.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-8.jpg /images/thumb/1/12/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-8.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-8.jpg          This is one of the reasons that using different colored t-shirts is suggested - this way, you know that you have the blue loop (for instance) on your left shoulder and the red one on the right shoulder.  Take the baby and slide him down your chest and then place one leg into each loop. Make sure that both legs are not in the same loop. Once his legs are in the proper place you should spread out the material to give him support and to prevent painful bunching. /images/thumb/c/c6/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-9.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-9.jpg /images/thumb/c/c6/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-9.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-9.jpg         , While the carrier is a great way to carry your baby, you'll need to be sure that you have positioned him correctly. Until he is six months old or so, you will want the baby to face inward rather than outward to prevent problems with the hip. Follow these positioning tips: /images/thumb/6/69/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-10.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-10.jpg /images/thumb/6/69/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-10.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-10.jpg          The baby should appear to be “seated” with his knees coming just above his bottom and comfortably bent. You can tell if the baby is in the proper position on your chest if you can bend and kiss his head without strain. The baby’s knees should be wide apart instead of forced inward. A good carrier keeps the hips and knees spread and supports the thighs., Take the third t-shirt piece and wrap the widest part (the back side of the tube) around the baby’s bottom and lower back area. Wrap the two flaps around your own waist and tie them securely to help support the baby. /images/thumb/3/3b/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-11.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-11.jpg /images/thumb/3/3b/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-11.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-11.jpg          This will also provide some additional support for your own lower back and should make the carrier much more comfortable to wear. Again, spread out the material to prevent bunching. Now you are ready to go with your easy, no-sew baby wrap carrier.  

choose the right t-shirts.  pick out your yarn.  gather your supplies.  cut all three t-shirts armpit to armpit, directly across.  take two of the tubes and tie them together in one spot, end to end.  lay the third fabric tube out flat.  take the tied loops and put them both over your head.  take one loop and place it over your arm and up to your shoulder and then repeat with the other loop to the other side.  place your baby in the carrier.  position your baby correctly.  use the third t-shirt piece to secure your baby’s bottom.

 Be specific and concrete. Identifying the things that you’re most afraid of will help you confront them. If you've been avoiding thinking about aging because it's too upsetting, this exercise may be exactly what you need to help you deal with getting older. The way you think about yourself and the process of getting older will affect the way you view your own life.For many people, getting older means getting closer to death. Their fears of aging are partially due to fears of death, either their own or the death of a loved one. Planning your end-of-life care and confronting the root of this fear may help. You may also fear losing your independence, becoming more physically frail, or developing health conditions related to aging. Learn more about adaptations and supports that will allow you to keep your independence for as long as possible. You might be concerned about your altered appearance. Find role models who have engaged gracefully with aging, either famous or in your own life. Talking with supportive friends, family or professionals can help you name your fears in a safe way. When you name your fears with close friends, you’ll likely feel better even if nothing else has changed.; , Naming all these fears might feel overwhelming, but naming fears doesn’t mean that they’re happening at the moment. Be aware that most things that you’re afraid of are not actually happening right now.When you notice your fears rising, ask yourself, “Is this happening now?” If the answer is no, turn your attention to the present moment. If there are steps that you can take to address the fear — such as planning long-term care options to address your fear of developing health conditions or physical frailty - then take action on these steps.  There are many reasons to look forward to getting older. For example, you’ll be able to draw on your lifelong experiences in order to help others. You may receive respect from younger people just starting out.Aging may allow you to slow down and enjoy your life, free of active parenting and work obligations. If you have saved for retirement, you may be able to enjoy learning and traveling for pleasure. You may be free of work and school responsibilities for the first time in your life.  If you fear getting older, it may be that you associate aging with unpleasant examples that you have been given. Many people reach old age with healthy bodies, their minds alert and their appreciation for life undimmed.If you realize that there are many people who’ve enjoyed old age, you’re less likely to be stuck in your fears. Look for examples in the media, in the community, and in your own life.  Even though many people are private about age-related topics, your friends can be a valuable source of experience and insight. Perhaps you have friends who are older, or who’ve already made long-term plans for themselves. Asking them about their experiences will help you better able to make your own plans.   Your friends can help you realize that everyone has to deal with getting older. You’ll find examples that you can use in your own life, both positive and negative. Older family members can also be helpful. If your parents are living, talking with them about their own aging process can offer you some ideas about what your own process might be.  Clinical studies have repeatedly shown that healthy aging is supported by feelings of social connection. Whether you spend time with friends, family members, or participate in other community activities, developing social connections is one of the best ways to care for yourself as you get older.Taking part in volunteer organizations, mentoring children, tutoring in schools are all ways you can interact with others and develop relationships. Try connecting with others online. If you have mobility limitations, or if you live far from your family, use online options to maintain communication. Video chats, such as Skype, Facetime, or other, are great ways to stay in touch.  

face your fears of aging.  stay in the moment.  focus on the good.  find role models.  talk to your friends.  stay connected to others. 

 What is your company’s vision and mission statement? Use these as a jumping-off point to write briefly about your organization’s purpose and values.   If you don’t have a mission statement, you should develop one. The mission statement should describe the company’s daily operations. For instance, an eyeglass manufacturing center might have a mission statement that reads, “Our mission is to provide quality eyewear at affordable prices.” If you don’t have a vision statement -- a statement that describes the organization’s imagined future and ultimate goals -- encourage your organization to create one. For instance, the above-mentioned eyeglass manufacturer’s vision statement might be, “To push optometry forward and ensure everyone can live a full life.” Mission and vision statements should be stable and long-term fixtures within the organization, and not subject to frequent change.  Resources are not only financial assets. They also include staff, stockholders, volunteers, and partner agencies or organizations.Incorporate these resources into your strategy in order to give yourself a clearer picture of where you are and where you’re going. When writing your strategy, you should answer the following questions:   Who or what are your resources? How can you better utilize your resources? Are there resources you need, but do not have? How can you obtain new resources?  , Write about short-term and long-term goals. Where do you see the organization in six months? Where do you see the organization in five to ten years?Together, these two perspectives will gives you a broad outline of where you want to be and what will come next when you've successfully executed your strategy. When writing about the goals of the strategy, answer questions like:   How will the organization or business change or expand? Will the company or organization be leaner in five years, with fewer employees and less real estate? Or will it be larger than it is today? What will the organization’s finances look in five to ten years? Use prior financial gains to make predictions about the future.  Even though it might hurt to confront the difficulties your business or organization faces, you can only move forward if you accept where you are. This part of the strategy should not only identify the obstacles to your organization, but also reflect on ways to overcome them.   How will the organization adapt to the changing market? If you’re in the museum world, for instance, you might need to address the fact that the number of museum visitors continues to drop each year. Write a list of what stands in your way along with actions you can take to successfully overcome these obstacles. Think about how to adjust marketing, payroll, sales figures and expenses.  Set goals for each category and describe exactly what that category will look like when finished. For best results, a goal must be specific, quantifiable and reasonable.   Your goals should be quantifiable. For instance, a goal like "Increase sales by 10%" is a good goal because it is specific, and you can measure sales using actual data. Recommend a timetable for each goal. For instance, you might say, “We should increase sales by 10% in the first quarter, and by another 10% in the second quarter.”  

elaborate on your organization’s identity.what is your organization about?,  make a tally of your resources.  define your goals.  confront obstacles to the strategy’s goals.be as complete and honest as possible during this step.  set specific goals. 

 Whisk the egg and half the milk in a bowl. Gradually add the flour to make a smooth, thick batter. Beat throughout until there are no more lumps, then add the remaining milk. It's important that your batter is quite thick so that the mixture doesn't run everywhere.; , A thin coat should suffice, but use more if you like. You may also consider using margarine, olive/vegetable oil, or a non-stick cooking spray.  The size of the pancake depends on the size of your plate, but be aware that larger pancakes will take longer to cook.  Adjust the time if you know that your microwave is particularly weak or strong. If the pancake is still runny, heat it for another ten seconds, but don't go overboard. There's no grill involved, so your pancake won't brown. If you do overcook your pancake, it will become dry, not burned.  Place the cooked pancake onto a clean plate. If the cooking plate is still well-greased with butter, then pour another dollop of pancake batter onto the first plate. If not, then spread more butter as needed to ensure that the next pancake doesn't stick. Cook the second pancake for one minute or until it is no longer runny. Repeat until you have as many pancakes as you want.  

mix flour, egg, butter, and milk.  cover a plate in butter to keep the pancake from sticking.  pour about 3/4 cup of pancake mix onto the plate.  put the plate in the microwave for 60 seconds.  repeat to make more. 

 One of the most common places for clothes to fold and crease is near your bottom and thighs when you sit. The fabric may get folded and permanently crease after you stand up.For dresses or dress shirts, pull down slightly on the tail when you sit so you are sitting on it flat, as opposed to pressing wrinkles into it with your body. In the car, unbutton the bottom button of your shirt and lay it over the lap belt. This will help prevent creasing along the area where your seat belt rests.  If you are in the habit of crossing your legs when you sit, be careful, as it will crease your pants. Just like when you sit, crossing your legs creates small folds in the fabric of your clothes that press down to create creases and wrinkles. Try sitting with your legs uncrossed on days you are avoiding creases.   When you are sitting at a desk or table, if space permits, stretch your legs out and keep them outstretched., The more contact and pressure your clothing receives, the more it will crease. Try to let your clothing hang loose and not be pressed up against your body by your hands, folded arms, bags, or jacket for long periods of time.  If you are at a party or other event where sitting is not required, stay standing. Sitting is mostly responsible for pant creases in the legs and the seat. If you are able to stand, you will minimize the opportunities for your trousers or dress to wrinkle. 

pull your clothes flat when you sit.  avoid crossing your legs.  don't put pressure on your clothes.  stand as much as possible. 

 Nail trimming is another important task. Use guillotine-type nail clippers to trim each nail to just above the quick (the thin vein in each nail) every one to two months. Consider trimming the nails just after a bath, when your Shih Tzu’s nails will be softened by the water.Keep some styptic powder close by when you trim the nails. If you cut the quick and the nail starts bleeding, put a dab of the powder on trimmed section of the nail., Shih Tzu are very prone to dental disease, which can create a lot of pain and discomfort in the mouth. Brushing your Shih Tzu’s teeth once or twice a week will help prevent dental disease.Use dog-specific toothpaste and a dog-safe toothbrush to clean the teeth.If your Shih Tzu won’t stay still enough for you to brush its teeth, ask your vet or a professional groomer to do the teeth cleaning. When you brush the teeth, look for swelling or redness of the gums.This could indicate dental disease.  After your Shih Tzu poops, some of the feces may get stuck in the hair around the bottom. Not only would this be smelly, but a buildup of feces could become very uncomfortable for your Shih Tzu. Once or twice a month, wipe around your Shih Tzu’s bottom with a warm, damp cloth to remove the feces. 

trim your shih tzu’s nails.  brush your shih tzu’s teeth.  clean around your shih tzu’s bottom. 

 Frugal people will track their expenses so that they know where their money is going. Map out your monthly expenses so you know what to expect as well as how to prepare for financial emergencies. For example, create a spreadsheet that tracks your monthly expenses. This will give you an idea of where you spend your money each month. By doing this, you may find some areas where you can cut back on costs and lead a more frugal lifestyle.Creating a monthly budget will help to ensure that you always have money available for necessities, such as housing, health care, and food.  Determine the amount of money you can put away each month and then don't spend that money. This will allow you to accumulate some money for unplanned expenses. Consider a high interest account to hold your cash. You will still have limited access to the money, but will most likely receive a better rate of return than a typical savings or checking account.   Also, don't forget to replenish used funds so you will always have money in case of an emergency.  In order to live frugally, you should create a financial plan and set financial goals. For example, do you want to pay off your mortgage, save up to buy a car, or save money for retirement? Setting financial goals will allow you to save money and still enjoy life. Examine what you hope to achieve financially so you can design a way to reach those goals. 

create a budget.  put money into emergency savings.  set financial goals. 

 Whisk the egg yolks, salt, powdered sugar, and lemon juice together by hand or using an electric mixer.   You could also use a blender or food processor instead of an electric mixer. Only use the egg yolks for this recipe, not the entire egg. Separate the yolks by capturing them in their shells as the egg whites drain or by running them through an egg separator.; , Whisk or blend thoroughly to combine.   Add the oil in a slow, steady stream to prevent the texture from turning clumpy. Pour the oil in through the hole in the lid of your food processor or blender. If using a whisk or electric mixer, hold the bowl steady by keeping a dish towel under it. Use one hand to pour the oil and the other to blend or whisk it in.  Blend after each addition to incorporate the remaining oil before adding more.   As before, you need to make sure the oil gets blended in fairly consistently as you add it.  Whisk or blend the vinegar in, combining well.   This is essentially a simple mayonnaise. Set the mixture aside and press on with the rest of the dressing.  Whisk the ingredients together rapidly until well combined.   You do not need a food processor, blender, or electric mixer for this step.  Heat the water over medium-high heat for a few minutes until it reaches a boil. Add the cornstarch mixture and cook.   Stir or whisk the mixture continuously as it cooks. Continue cooking until the mixture has a smooth, pudding-like consistency. Do not let it get thicker than this.  Blend or whisk well to combine.   You can either whisk the mixture by hand or use your blender, food processor, or electric mixer.  Sprinkle these seasonings into the dressing and gently mix them in with a spoon or spatula to incorporate them.  Let it cool inside the refrigerator before using.   Store the dressing inside the refrigerator when not in use. It should stay fresh for a few days to a week.  

blend the first four ingredients.  slowly drizzle in 1 cup (250 ml) oil.  gradually add the remaining 1/2 cup (125 ml) of oil.  add 2 tbsp (30 ml) of vinegar.  mix the cornstarch, dry mustard, and remaining vinegar in a separate bowl.  boil 1 cup (250 ml) water in a small saucepan.  slowly add the hot cornstarch mixture to the mayonnaise mixture.  fold in the paprika and garlic powder.  store the dressing in an airtight container.

 Be sure to look at the relationship from her perspective as well, and not just yours. Remember that she has feelings as well. Consider the following:   Is our relationship strong or weak? What are the positives of my relationship with her? What are the negatives of my relationship with her? What can be done to improve my relationship with her? Have I done anything wrong in the past to hurt her deeply?  If so, could her hostile behavior towards me be a result of my mistake?  ; , What subject did those arguments mostly circle around? Were they petty or important fights? If you two fight frequently, you may want to try to lower the number!  , Has she been dealing with problems at school or outside of the family? If she has been, she probably is taking out her frustration on you - one of the few or many things she is able to pick on easily. If this is the situation you are looking at, remember that she has feelings just like you do, and she may actually going through a hard time.  Siblings can easily get jealous of one another, and wish they had their siblings' successes or life. If that is the case, treat your older sister nicely, and bring everyone's attention to her excellent qualities and talents. Speak nicely of her, and make sure people know that she is a good person.   Be careful of who you tell your sister's qualities to, as this could end badly. It's best to tell your friends about how talented your sister is, so that they will look up to her.  

contemplate your relationship with your older sister.  think about any recent fights you have had with her.  consider her own personal life.  remember that she may be just jealous of you and your life. 

   Know the varieties of valuable coins. Know the number of coins minted in a series. Be aware of mint-made errors that can make coins more valuable. Know the socio-political context of coin minting.; ,   Recognize mint state coins (MS). These are uncirculated coins of very high quality. Look for almost uncirculated coins (AU). Many times, if a coin is in great condition but the light of the coin reflects differently from the high points of the coin as opposed to the lower points of the coin, then the coin is usually AU. Identify Extremely Fine (XF or EF) coins. These coins have wear that is easy to see, but they still have their mint luster. Recognize Very Fine (VF) coins. All of the major features of these coins will be intact, but the minor features such as hair detail and feathers will be worn. Look for Fine coins (F). Fine coins have few details, but the original design is largely intact. Identify Very Good (VG) coins. VG coins have a raised rim, but the details of the design may be lacking in detail. Recognize Good (G) coins. These coins have a legible date and mint mark but do not have to have full rims. Look for Almost Good (AG) coins. These coins will have a date that may be tough to identify. You will be able to see the outlines of the design. Identify Fair (Fair) coins. These coins are identifiable as being a certain denomination but not much more. They may be bent or have holes. Recognize Basal State (Basal) coins. The lump of metal is identifiable as a coin.  This will help you develop your skills and to network with other dealers.  Good choices include Coin World and Numismatic News.

This will help you to gain experience in the industry. You may be able to buy out the dealer after a while or you may go on to have your own business.  

possess broad numismatic knowledge.  know how to grade coins.  attend coin shows.  read trade publications.  study the precious metals markets.  join a professional organization.  work for a coin dealer. 

 Swim rescues should be used as a last resort. They require training and very good swimming skills. Victims are often thrashing and panicking which can make it hazardous to perform a swimming rescue., Do not attempt a swimming rescue without a buoy on hand; a drowning victim's first reaction will be to climb on top of you, so you'll need a flotation device to keep both of you safe and perform the rescue effectively. If you don't have a buoy, go in with a t-shirt or towel that the victim can grab onto., Use the freestyle stroke to quickly get to the drowning person. If you are in a large body of water, use ocean swimming techniques to avoid getting tossed back in a wave.Toss the buoy or rope for the person to grab.Instruct the victim to grab the object. Remember not to swim right up to the victim, since he or she is likely to push you under the water.  Move in a straight line back to shore, towing the person behind you. Check back every few paces to make sure he or she is still holding the buoy or rope. Continue swimming until you make it safely back to shore, then exit the water.   Keep a safe distance between you and the victim.  

be sure of your swimming abilities.  dive in with an aid.  swim to the victim.  swim back to shore. 

 Greet each morning with a ritual. Try this one, suggested by the Dalai Lama: “Today I am fortunate to have woken up, I am alive, I have a precious human life, I am not going to waste it. I am going to use all my energies to develop myself, to expand my heart out to others, to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings, I am going to have kind thoughts towards others, I am not going to get angry or think badly about others, I am going to benefit others as much as I can.” Then, when you’ve done this, try one of the practices below.; , The first step in cultivating compassion, is to develop empathy for your fellow human beings and yourself. Many of us believe that we have empathy, and on some level nearly all of us do. But many times we are centered on ourselves and we let our sense of empathy get rusty. Try this practice: Imagine that a loved one is suffering. Something terrible has happened to him or her. Now try to imagine the pain they are going through. Imagine the suffering in as much detail as possible. After doing this practice for a couple of weeks, you should try moving on to imagining the suffering of others you know, not just those who are close to you. This means that you should experience the other persons suffering or emotions from that persons frame of reference, meaning as if you are in that persons shoes.   To keep empathy from turning into sympathy, keep your focus on the other person, rather than allowing your empathy to shift your focus to your own experience and memory of suffering., Instead of recognizing the differences between yourself and others, try to recognize what you have in common. At the root of it all, we are all human beings. We need food, and shelter, and love. We crave attention, and recognition, and affection, and above all, happiness. Reflect on these commonalities you have with every other human being, and ignore the differences. One favorite exercise comes from a great article from Ode Magazine — it’s a five-step exercise to try when you meet friends and strangers. Do it discreetly and try to do all the steps with the same person. With your attention geared to the other person, tell yourself:Step 1: “Just like me, this person is seeking happiness in his/her life.” Step 2: “Just like me, this person is trying to avoid suffering in his/her life.” Step 3: “Just like me, this person has known sadness, loneliness and despair.” Step 4: “Just like me, this person is seeking to fulfill his/her needs.” Step 5: “Just like me, this person is learning about life.”  , Once you can empathize with another person, and understand his humanity and suffering, the next step is to want that person to be free from suffering. This is the heart of compassion — actually the definition of it. Try this exercise: Imagine the suffering of a human being you’ve met recently. Now imagine that you are the one going through that suffering. Reflect on how much you would like that suffering to end. Reflect on how happy you would be if another human being desired your suffering to end, and acted upon it. Open your heart to that human being and if you feel even a little that you’d want their suffering to end, reflect on that feeling. That’s the feeling that you want to develop. With constant practice, that feeling can be grown and nurtured.   A study suggests that the more you meditate on compassion, the more your brain reorganizes itself to feel empathy towards others.  Now that you’ve gotten good at the fourth practice, take the exercise a step further. Imagine again the suffering of someone you know or met recently. Imagine again that you are that person, and are going through that suffering. Now imagine that another human being would like your suffering to end — perhaps your mother or another loved one. What would you like for that person to do to end your suffering? Now reverse roles: you are the person who desires for the other person’s suffering to end. Imagine that you do something to help ease the suffering, or end it completely. Once you get good at this stage, practice doing something small each day to help end the suffering of others, even in a tiny way. Even a smile, or a kind word, or doing an errand or chore, or just talking about a problem with another person. Practice doing something kind to help ease the suffering of others. When you are good at this, find a way to make it a daily practice, and eventually a throughout-the-day practice.  The final stage in these compassion practices is to not only want to ease the suffering of those we love and meet, but even those who mistreat us. When we encounter someone who mistreats us, instead of acting in anger, withdraw. Later, when you are calm and more detached, reflect on that person who mistreated you. Try to imagine the background of that person. Try to imagine what that person was taught as a child. Try to imagine the day or week that person was going through, and what kind of bad things had happened to that person. Try to imagine the mood and state of mind that person was in — the suffering that person must have been going through to mistreat you that way. And understand that their action was not about you, but about what they were going through. Now think some more about the suffering of that poor person, and see if you can imagine trying to stop the suffering of that person. And then reflect that if you mistreated someone, and they acted with kindness and compassion toward you, whether that would make you less likely to mistreat that person the next time, and more likely to be kind to that person. Once you have mastered this practice of reflection, try acting with compassion and understanding the next time a person mistreats you. Do it in little doses, until you are good at it. Practice makes perfect.   It will take time to manage your emotions to the extent that you can practice full compassion, but the following techniques will help; in addition, people who practiced them in a study produced 100 percent more DHEA, which is a hormone that counteracts the aging process, and 23 percent less cortisol — the “stress hormone.”Cut-through: Observe your feelings, focusing on your heart. Pretend you're someone outside of the situation, giving yourself advice like "Relax, it's no big deal." Imagine your negative feelings getting absorbed and diffused by your heart. This will help you transform rather than repress your negative feelings.Heart lock-in: Quiet your mind and focus your attention on your heart. Tap into feelings that you have towards someone or something you love easily, and try to stay with that feeling for ten or fifteen minutes. Then imagine sending those feelings to yourself and others.You may also want to read How to Forgive.  It is highly recommended that you take a few minutes before you go to bed to reflect upon your day. Think about the people you met and talked to, and how you treated each other. Think about your goal that you stated this morning, to act with compassion towards others. How well did you do? What could you do better? What did you learn from your experiences today? And if you have time, try one of the above practices and exercises.  

develop a morning ritual.  practice empathy.  practice commonalities.  practice relief of suffering.  practice the act of kindness.  move beyond to practice compassion for those who mistreat us.  develop an evening routine. 

 You could buy a camo pattern, a printed leaf and grass pattern, or a plain color like olive green. Choose the color based on your surroundings. For sufficient material to make a bandana, be sure the fabric is at least 2 feet (0.61 m) by 2ft. Consider using fabric that is 100% cotton or polyester for breathability. You can buy fabric at your local arts and crafts store or on Amazon for around $10., A standard bandana is 22 inches (55.9 cm) by 22 inches. If you want a larger one, you could make it 27 inches (68.6 cm) by 27 inches. To keep the bandana from unravelling, you can sew a hem around the outside. Simply fold the fabric in about an inch and stitch around the outer edge., You can add more camouflage or contrast to your bandana if you would like. Use spray paint in tan, green, and black and add splotches to your bandana. You could also use fabric paint or markers. Feel free to decorate it how you see fit. You could add some stripes to simulate grass or blotches to look like leaves. You can also fasten foliage to your bandana.  Fold the fabric in half diagonally and wrap it around your face with the large part in the front and the narrow part in the back. The bandana should face down, forming a “V” shape towards your neck. Cover your nose and mouth but keep your eyes uncovered. Tie a double knot in the back of your head with the ends of the fabric. Secure it tightly so that it stays in place, but not too tight where it is uncomfortable.

Discuss if there are any holidays or celebrations that the two of you are comfortable celebrating together, such as a birthday or a promotion at work. It may be that you agree to avoid all celebrations and personal milestones completely.  In a romantic relationship, it is typical for couples to tackle serious, difficult issues and topics. In a casual relationship, the obligation to sort through the heavy emotions isn’t there. You don’t necessarily need to omit sharing personal details and stories from conversations with your partner, but avoiding deep, personal conversations may help maintain the level of simplicity. Discuss with your partner about how you two should approach more serious conversations and situations.   Conversations can be current and cheerful.

 In just five to ten minutes, you can relieve common morning stiffness, as well as increase your flexibility over time. Stretching your neck is a good place to start, and will help you transition from a prone to an upright position.Simply lean your head sideways, bringing your right ear close to your right shoulder. You can use your right hand to help deepen the stretch, but be gentle and don't force your head over more than is comfortable. Practice deep breathing and hold the stretch without pulsing, then release and repeat the stretch on your left side. You also can do this stretch by lifting and lowering your chin to stretch the front and back of your neck. Do a few forward neck rolls as well. Only roll your neck forward and from side to side in a half-circle motion. Don’t roll your neck backwards or you may hurt yourself.; , Depending on your sleeping position, you may have pain or stiffness in your chest, back, and shoulders when you wake up in the morning. Chest and upper back stretches allow tense muscles to relax.To stretch the back of your shoulders, stand and reach your arms out in front of you, pressing your palms together. Lower your chin to your chest and pull your shoulder blades away from each other, feeling the stretch in your upper back. To stretch your chest, turn your hands so your palms are facing forward. Then, reach both of your arms wide out to the sides at waist height and pull the shoulder blades together. Or, you can also try standing in a doorway with your hands on the walls on either side of the door. This will give your chest a good stretch. Only go into these stretches as far as you can with comfort. If you feel any pain, stop stretching immediately – don't force yourself to stretch your muscles beyond their limits.  Particularly if you work out on a regular basis, stretching your arms and shoulders in the morning is essential. Your shoulders are a delicate joint, and these stretches help improve your mobility.To stretch the back of your shoulder, stand and extend your right arm in front of you and across your chest. Pull it close with your left hand and hold it as close across your chest as you comfortably can. Take care not to pulse or bounce, and don't force it.

Stretching your sides will lengthen your muscles and improve your overall stability, as well as stretching your lower back.To do a hip flexion stretch, hold onto the back of a chair. Then, step backwards two steps and bend forward at your hips, letting your elbows point down to the floor.If you can't bend forward very far without discomfort, just lean over as far as you can, keeping your back flat and straight. While standing, plant your feet about hip-width apart and wrap your left hand around your right wrist, then raise your arms over your head. Gently pull your right arm towards your left side in a side stretching motion. Then, return to the center and repeat the movement on the other side. From a seated position, extend one leg straight in front of you and cross the other leg over top of it, so your knee is bent and your foot is flat on the floor. Rotate your torso towards the crossed leg either by grabbing that leg or by resting your elbow on the outside of that knee. Keep your back straight and long. Come back to center, then repeat the stretch on the other side.  Keeping the muscles in your legs loose is essential, especially if you're a runner. Stretching the muscles in your lower body also can help to keep your joints loose and prevent ankle and knee injuries, as well as relieving foot, leg, and back pain.You can stretch your calves simply by leaning against a wall or chair.

 Bonus points if your eyes and smirk says, “I’m trouble. Come get me.”; , The truth is, like most men, women want to date men who are fit. However, this isn’t always the rule. Really, women just want to see the product before they go and purchase it. If you have a nice body, then a shot of you playing tennis or running on the beach are always good shots.  So if you have a cute tush and can accentuate it by wearing tight pants, go for it. But just remember, no shots of your privates. Yes, there’s a difference between private shots and butt shots. Most men post private shots and it’s old. But women find “cute butts” – well – cute. But ONLY if they really are cute.

 Tea is very calming. Drinking hot tea while you study or while you take a break from studying can help you feel more relaxed and less stressed. Studies show that black tea is the most effective for relaxation.Avoid drinking too much coffee or caffeinated beverages because these may cause you to crash later on.  Not only is dark chocolate tasty, it also helps to decrease the level of cortisol in your body. Cortisol is the hormone that is responsible for stress. This, in turn, will make you feel more relaxed.In order for this step to be effective the chocolate must contain 70% cocoa.  You must find a balance between your schoolwork and your life. To do this you must take breaks from studying and spend those breaks not thinking about studying. Use this time to get some rest, exercise, or a bite to eat.Take a walk outside. The walk will give you some exercise as well as some much needed sunlight. Sunlight is known to help improve your mood. Go out to dinner with some friends. Be sure to laugh, smile, and talk about things other than your schoolwork. Take a vacation or a stay-cation. Schedule yourself a day off from studying each week.  Deep breathing is also known to reduce cortisol levels in your body. It is also shown to reduce your blood pressure. This will help you to relax and feel lower levels of stress and anxiety.Use the 7-7-7 relaxation technique. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath in through your nose and count to seven in your head. Release that breath through your mouth and count to seven again in your head. Repeat this seven times., Listening to a calming music, such as classical music, can help to improve your mood and make you feel happier. Listening to music may also help you to study longer.   Avoid distracting music such as hard rock or metal. Classical or ambient music is the best option.  If you are going to be successful, you need to be confident in your abilities. Negative thoughts and attitudes toward studying will undermine your efforts. Avoid engaging in these conversations with your friends, too.  Avoid saying or thinking things like “I can’t get this no matter how much I study.” If the project seems overwhelming, just focus on one task at a time. Try not to think about the project as a whole or you may feel stressed and experience an increase in negative self-talk.  Close your eyes and feel the tension in your body. Breathe deeply in and out through your nose. Picture yourself in a relaxing place. Allow your body to let go of the tension that you feel. This will bring you down to a lower level of stress, and improve your studying and/or test taking abilities. 

drink some tea.  eat some dark chocolate.  take a break.  practice your deep breathing.  listen to music.  use positive self-talk.  use visualization techniques to relax. 

 Network Media Players are like conduits that allow you to connect to the Internet and also interface with your television, allowing you to watch streaming video on the big screen. Roku and AppleTV are examples of these devices, but new video game consoles also come with the technology installed. Most of these devices are connected via Ethernet cables, or wirelessly. Each will involve a slightly different set up process, depending on the device. Examples of Network Media Players include:   Apple TV X-Box 360 or higher Playstation 3 or higher Roku  , When you've installed your Network Media Player, use the remote that came with it to navigate to the streaming service to which you subscribe and log in. If you need to start one, you can also use the Network Player to do that, entering your billing information, or hooking it into a pre-existing account.  Navigate around the options like usual, using your remote. It should work in almost exactly the same way, and should include the same basic content that your online account includes when you access it on your computer. If you watch half of a Netflix movie on your laptop, you can pick it up right where you left off on the TV.  The classic way of renting movies is to rent pay-per-view directly from the cable provider, or purchase on-demand video options through your cable company. You can usually already see the movies available on your menu screen, select one to purchase, and tune in instantly, or when the allotted time arrives. This will be billed to your cable statement.  

set up a network media player to watch streaming video on your television.  open your streaming service rental account, or start a new one.  select a movie.  alternatively, rent pay-per-view movies from your cable provider.

 Doctors sometimes recommend soaking in warm water to relieve itching, pain, or discomfort associated with herpes outbreaks. You may find that aluminum acetate (Domeboro) or magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts) help relieve the affected area, although these are not doctor-recommended treatments.   Cleanse sores gently with soap and warm water. Keeping blisters clean may help speed healing. When the area is not soaking in warm water, try to keep it dry. If toweling the area dry after stepping out of the bath is uncomfortable, use a hair drier instead.  Cotton underwear is a must. Restrictive clothing and synthetic pantyhose, underwear, or pants can aggravate genital herpes symptoms, as these synthetic materials tend not to breathe as well as fabrics like cotton.  Although topical treatments are generally less effective than systemic treatments, they can sometimes be used to treat pain or discomfort.   Taking OTC pain medications, such as aspirin (Bayer), acetaminophen (Tylenol), or ibuprofen (Advil) is often recommended to help with pain.  In its natural state, propolis is resinous material collected from the buds of poplar trees, although it is often harvested from beehives. A 3% propolis ointment (Herstat or ColdSore-FX), applied to herpes lesions, may help heal lesions.In one study, propolis ointment was used four times a day, for 10 days, among 30 participants. Afterwards, 24 of 30 participants who used propolis during the study reported that their lesions healed, while only 14 of 30 participants who used a placebo reported that their lesions healed., Prunella vulgaris and Rozites caperata have both shown some promise in fighting herpes.Prunella vulgaris can be used in a hot water treatment to soothe and heal sores, while Rozites caperata may be ingested to help treat sores.  

soak the affected area in warm water, but when not soaking, keep area dry.  wear loose, breathable underwear and clothing.  if your ulcers are very painful, ask a physician about a topical anesthetic to apply to affected areas.  try an ointment containing propolis.  try the herb prunella vulgaris and the mushroom rozites caperata. 

 You have 95 spaces so you're free to mix and match. Try to keep a class for every distance, Short range is best done with an smg, medium/long with assault rifles, long and extreme long should be done with sniper rifles.; ,, when you fire an un-suppressed gun, you will appear as a small red dot on enemy radar and on a map that is pulled up by an enemy before he calls an air strike. Firing a suppressed gun does not make you appear on enemy radar.  You will remain invisible to enemy radar when an enemy calls in a UAV, which reveals the location of certain enemies for a period of about 30 seconds.  AS SOON AS RED JETS APPEAR ON YOUR RADAR, GET INDOORS IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE AN ENEMY AIR STRIKE IS COMING IN ABOUT 5 SECONDS. Green jets are O.K. because that is a friendly airstrike and it can't kill you (unless friendly fire is on).  It takes a lot of bullets, but it can be destroyed. It is recommended that you have an RPG on your team so he can destroy it easily. , Find the one you like. I personally like the MP5 with a Silencer 3 Flashbangs or Stun Grenades for Perk 1, Stopping power or Sleight of Hand (faster reloading) for Perk 2, and Martyrdom or Last Stand for perk 3.  Avoid sprinting the whole lot, since its pretty easy shooting a linear moving foe.* No cover? Do the following drill, sprint->Jump->crouch->sprint, impossible to get a clean torso/headshot. , this way if you have even any skill you will win 1 on 1 every time.  

use a setup you feel comfortable with.camp when guarding objectives, but do it smart, get a clear view over the objective and paths enemies use  ,  equip silencers on some of your guns (if you have it unlocked for that gun).  if you don't have silencers unlocked for any decent guns, try using the uav jammer perk.  watch your radar for the location of enemies.  if there is an enemy chopper in the air, tell your team to shoot it, and shoot it yourself too.  glass, thin sheets of wood, thin metal and thin concrete can be shot through, remember this.  ,  try out all the weapons and perk combos.  when in dangerous open area, take short sprints from safe covered spots to other safe covered spots.try to go around fire fights, a lot of people get caught up in intense fights in the same part of each map, going around the fight and attacking from behind is a sure fire way to earn some kills  ,  if you want to cheaply own no matter what, then upgrade your connection so you are host, then use the m16 and stopping power. 

 Go with shoes you'll likely have on when you use the crutches. , Correctly fitted, the wrist grip should line up roughly with where you usually wear a watch.  The half-circle or V-shaped cuff should sit halfway between your wrist and elbow. They shouldn't push your shoulders up when holding or make you hunch over.   This sizing is important because you'll want a 15 - 30 degree bend in your arms when using the crutches. Sizing correctly will give your arms and shoulders their full range of motion, allowing you to consistently plant the crutches at 30 degree angles.  

put on a pair of everyday shoes.  stand up as straight as possible and let your arms fall down to your sides, relaxed.  ,  take the forearm crutch and fit the hand grip so that it falls in line with your wrist joint.  fit the arm cuff mid-way up your forearm. 

, You are under-cooking the pasta because it will finish cooking in the oven.  Make sure that the skillet is large enough to hold the spaghetti sauce , which you will be adding later. Stir the onion and ground beef occasionally with a spatula so that they cook evenly.  This will help the flavors mix and blend together. Stir occasionally so that everything cooks evenly.  Use a spatula to spread the pasta across the bottom of the dish in a even layer, then lay all of the Provolone slices on top. Spread the sour cream on top of the Provolone cheese. You will add the rest of the pasta in another layer.   Use a 9 by 13 inch (22.86 by 33.02 centimeters) baking dish.  Try to spread it as evenly as possible. You are only using half now, because you will be adding the rest of it in another layer.  Spread the pasta across the sauce mixture first, then add the mozzarella cheese. Try to spread everything as evenly as possible. Finish off with the rest of the sauce mixture.  This will be your finishing touch, and help create that final, crispy layer.  If you want to get that nice, crispy layer on top, place your dish under the broiler until the cheese turns golden. This will take about 4 minutes., This also allows the sauce to settle into all of the nooks and crannies of the pasta. 

preheat the oven to 350°f (175°c).  ,  cook the pasta in salted water for 3 minutes less than the recommended time, then drain it and set it aside.  brown the onion and ground beef in a skillet over medium heat.  add the spaghetti sauce and let it simmer for 15 minutes.  add half of the pasta, provolone cheese, and sour cream into a greased baking dish.  spread half of the sauce mixture on top of the sour cream.  add the rest of the pasta, mozzarella cheese, and sauce mixture.  top the dish with grated parmesan cheese.  bake for 30, or until cheeses are melted.  remove the dish from the oven, and let it cool for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.  finished.  

 If you do much of the driving, you have control over when you stop. Also, it may distract you from what's going on with your stomach, as well as take your mind off any stress you have ahead., If you look at your route, you can plan ahead of time for taking breaks. If you know a stretch of road is pretty barren, you can make sure you stop beforehand, for instance, as well as mark where rest stops and small towns are on you way., It's a common problem for public restrooms to be out of toilet paper. It's a good idea to carry your own supply of toilet paper or even a roll of toilet paper which you can use while traveling. Luckily, they have convenient travel packs now, which makes it easier to travel with your own.   You may also want to carry a bottle of antibacterial hand gel, in case the restroom doesn't have soap. These supplies can also help if you must make an emergency stop on the side of the road.  Before you embark on a trip, it's a good idea to do a little research into what kinds of restaurants are along the way. You can then plan for good meals that won't irritate your stomach instead of being stuck with food that can cause problems.   If you find that there are no suitable food options along the way, you should plan on packing your own meals.  

be the designated driver.  map out the route.  bring your own supply of toilet paper.  plan where you are going to eat along the way. 

 Prepare the baking tray/sheet either by greasing or lining with baking/parchment paper.; ,, Mix until a smooth dough is formed.   If you find that the dough is a little too dry, add a little water. , Roll both pieces of dough into two thin rounds. Try to make both even in height and keep the edges tidy.  Use a fork to prick all over the dough rounds. Then, use a butter knife to gently mark six triangles.  Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until they turn a pale golden colour.  While still warm, sprinkle with the caster/superfine sugar. Then, cut into the triangles. Transfer to the wire cooling rack to cool. 

preheat the oven to 350ºf/180ºc.  cream the butter and icing sugar in the mixing bowl.  ,  sift in the flours.  halve the dough.  ,  sprinkle flour over the work surface.  place both rounds onto the prepared baking tray/sheet.  place in the oven.  remove from the oven.  finished.  

 Here are just a few things you can cook or bake using carrots:   Carrot halva  Carrot cake, vegan carrot cake, carrot cake pops   Carrot cake doughnuts.  

the natural sweetness of carrots lends itself well to many sweet dishes. 

 These can be purchased cheaply on eBay and if you look there over a period of a month you will see many different types in various states of repair. They range from "ready for restoration" to "immaculate unused".; ,,, The possibility of accidental fire in the home is just too great and easily avoided.  Do not fill the boiler. If there is an overflow hole on the end opposite to the chimney. Leave this open while filling and stop when water comes out. Use HOT water to minimise start time and maximise running time.  There needs to be some air space left in the boiler above the water to allow pressure to build up.  Make sure all the filler and overflow holes have their caps screwed back into place before fueling.  Now let's look at what to do about fueling up. There are two types of fuel. Present day fuel is in solid tablet form which are placed into a burner tray. It may be necessary to cut these tablets down in size to fit your particular burner as they do differ in size in accordance with the boiler size. Older models have spirit burners which contain either non replaceable gauze or replaceable wicks that soak up their liquid fuel.  With old type rectangular shaped gauze style burners you should pour an amount of Methylated Spirit directly into the top of the burner. The burners were sized to be filled until you can just see the alcohol on top of the gauze. There will then be enough fuel for a good run of the boiler, but not enough to boil it dry. Do not refill the burner without topping up the boiler again. If you have an even older type of engine it will have a round tank burner with wicks numbering between one to three. Again, just fill up the tank through the filler hole and refit the brass screw cap finger tight.  But wait, you need to squirt oil onto the moving parts. To put it simply, any moving parts that are in friction contact with another need some oil. You can but Mamod oil although any oil is better than no oil! Castor oil is one of the most effective options available. You can use car engine oil, handyman oil or the real thing. Don't use grease as it will not flow and so will not lubricate fully.  Spin the flywheel using your finger to get the oil around a bit and to ensure everything runs smoothly.  Just practice this once before light up. And then, the action begins! Using a box of matches, ignite the burner and using the burner handle, place the burning burner neatly under the boiler. From now on, do not leaving your engine until the burning process is completed and the hot boiler is not in harms way.  Steam will begin to hiss in the area of the piston. Now you can gently flick round the flywheel. It revolves in a clockwise direction as seen when looking at the piston side of the engine.  If you want to stop it running very temporarily you may place your finger into the flywheel to restrict its movement. If you do that, the Safety Valve will fizz with boiling steam and water until you allow the flywheel to run again. This is not a dangerous thing to do and can be quite fun but just be wary of the very hot spitting steam!  , 

buy a mamod engine.  decide upon either one that remains in a fixed position, known as a stationary engine or one that moves along the ground known as a mobile engine.  ,  know that there are some basic things you now need to do starting with "getting it running" like getting water and fuel.  ,  and always - always take your alcohol or dry fuel engine outside to run it.  make sure that water is to be carefully poured into the boiler through the hole in the top where the safety valve is located.  on the boiler back plate, either look at the water level glass or as with older engines, the water level hole, and stop filling when the correct level is reached.  if you have a water level plug type, this is the time to screw it, finger tight, back into the hole.  fuel next.  the liquid you need here is methylated spirit or methyl alcohol.  now you are nearly ready to fire up.  now check that your safety valve (and water level plug) is tight and your water level is correct.  place the burner close to the engine and ready to insert under the boiler.  gradually the water will begin to get hot and then raise a head of steam.  everything should now be running smoothly and you can let it run until the fuel runs out.  when you have had enough of running the engine, drain the water and just put it away - clean it if you want to but it's not absolutely necessary.  

 If you cannot remove the pillow insert, make sure that the cover is washable. If it is not washable, you will need to spot clean the cover instead. Click here to learn how to clean a non-removable pillow cover., The last thing you'd want is to put a damaged pillow into a washer, and open the door at the end of the cycle to find a pile of feathers. Before you stick your pillow into the washer, examine it carefully. Focus on the body of the pillow as well as the seams. If you see any rips or tears, stitch them up using a needle and thread., Placing the pillows vertically will ensure that they won't wrap around the agitator while they are spinning and get tangled.Washing two pillows at once will help balance out the drum inside the washing machine. Washing the pillows separate from the rest of your laundry will ensure that there is enough water to rinse the soap out properly. If the pillow is not washable, toss it into dryer with a few tennis balls or dryer balls. The head will kill any odor-causing bacteria., When choosing soap, make sure that it is liquid and low sudsing; powdered detergent will be too difficult to wash out.  If the care label on your pillow has different requirements for water temperature, detergent, and cycle setting, follow what the label says instead., Because pillows are so bulky, a single rinse cycle may not be enough. Many people find that they have to do an additional rinse cycle or two in order to get all of the suds out., The longer they sit, the more likely they will end up smelling musty., Do not twist or wring the pillow. Instead, place it at the end of a large, clean towel. Place another towel right on top, so that the pillow is sandwiched in between. Start rolling the pillow along with the two towels, from one end to the other. Press down on the roll, then unravel it.  Repeat this step for any other pillows you have just washed  , If the pillows are filled with feathers, use the no-heat setting. If the pillows are filled with a synthetic material, such as fiberfill, use a low-heat setting.Consider adding a few dryer balls or tennis balls into the dryer along with the pillows. This will help them dry faster as well as fluff them up.You can also lay pillows flat to dry. They will dry the fastest if they are laid out in the sun. If the care label on your pillow has different drying instructions, follow what the label says instead., Do not cover wet pillows, or they will start to get moldy and smell musty. 

remove the pillow insert from the cover from the pillow, if you can.  make sure that there are no tears in the pillow, and repair any you find.  place two pillows into the washer vertically, and do not include the rest of your laundry.  use cool to warm water, a mild soap, and a gentle cycle.  consider doing another rinse cycle.  remove the pillows promptly once the cycle ends.  squeeze out any excess water by placing the pillow between two towels and rolling it up.  dry the pillow in the dryer on a no-heat to low-heat setting.  place the covers onto the pillows once everything is completely dry. 

 The most important part of helping your friend feel better, is to spend time with her if she is open to it.One way you can initiate contact with your friend is by texting or calling her and saying, "I know this is hard and I want to be there for you. Can we spend some time together?" Depending on how your friend responds you can act accordingly. She may not feel up to it, so don't press the issue; say something like, "I completely understand. Please do let me know if you want me to come over in the future. Also, if you need anything else don't hesitate to ask." Your friend may just want a shoulder to cry on, or someone to sit around in pajamas with. Be open to just sitting around and tolerating her being sad. Try not to cheer her up if she doesn't request it.  Many grieving individuals report a need to talk about their grief and loss with others.If your friend wants to talk about her grief or the loss of her loved one, listen. Do not immediately change the subject in order to try to make yourself or her feel better. Let her express her emotions and thoughts about what happened and listen attentively.   Focus on your friend’s personal values and beliefs. For example, avoid saying generalized things like, “they are in a better place now” to people who are not religious or do not believe in an afterlife. You can express your empathy by saying, “I know how hard this is for you.” You can even tell her about a time that you experienced a loss in order to empathize further and communicate your understanding of her feelings.  Don’t expect your friend to bounce back immediately. Everyone grieves differently. Some people cry and can’t get out of bed for days, while others go back to work immediately. Fortunately, people can be very resilient in the face of loss and most individuals do recover.Be patient with your friend during the grief process.  Give your friend space if she needs it or requests it. Some people may need more connection during this time, while others will need space.This is due to different attachment styles that people have based on their upbringing and family relationships; some people may be more avoidant of connection in times of stress, some may want more attention when they are sad, while others are more balanced in their needs (wanting both connection and space).   If your friend refuses to see you or doesn’t want to talk, don’t take it personally. She could just be too tired or depressed to want to interact with anyone, and this is completely normal.  

spend time with your friend.  express empathy and listen actively.  give your friend time.  provide for space. 

 You’ll typically find it in the app drawer. The name of the program varies by device, but it’s usually called File Manager, My Files, File Browser, or Files.

 Visualize it in your mind and if you can, rotate it in your brain, to better understand what you'll be drawing.; , to relate to. This will aid in the shading process, and even help you sketch look better if you understand the basic shape of what you are about to draw.  If you are uncomfortable, your drawing will look worse than what it should, so get a nice chair, fix the lighting and put on some favorite music.  If your hands are all sticky, wet or cold, your hand will not perform as well as it should.  There's no set way.  If it is something large, such as a car or tree, then get a clip board, sit down by it, and start sketching. , If you make a mistake, then you can easily erase the light lines.  Do not do a blind contour (staring at your subject while trying to draw), although this is good for practice drawing, it can deform your drawing terribly.  If you think you sketched lines too close or too far apart, erase them. Too many sketch lines on a drawing makes it look like your drawing is twisting. Going over the same line many times can make it dark and hard to erase if you decide it's wrong.  To add value, on the darker, shaded parts of the object you're drawing, shade them on your sketch. Go from a very dark, and lighten it gradually to a very light shade.  It'll make your drawing look better, and add some theme to it.  Traditionally, after a sketch, artists lightly add their signature (Yes, in cursive) to the bottom right corner of their drawing. You can also add something like '13 to it, too if you'd like.  

to start off, think of your planned sketch.  look for shapes such as circles, squares, triangles, etc.  position yourself comfortably.  good hands: how does that help?,  position your paper: this goes along with being comfortable, so put your paper at an angle that you feel comfortable with.  if your item is small, place it in front of you where you can effectively sketch it.  begin drawing.  ,  start from one side of the object, quickly and lightly take your pencil back and forth on the paper to make soft, light strokes.  be sure to constantly look up at your subject and compare the two.  don't be afraid to use the eraser.  apply finishing touches: when you're done, take your eraser and remove the sketchy lines if you wish.  add more interest, add a poorly sketched (but still alright looking) background.  add your signature! 

 Cholera is most often passed through drinking or using water that has cholera bacteria in it. Getting your water from sources that you know are safe and clean can help you avoid contracting cholera.Adequate chlorination of local water supplies is essential. Even if water is treated with chlorine, if it is not enough (parts per million dose), then even treated water can pass on the cholera bacteria and infection can result. When in doubt, opt for boiled drinking water. Ask your host or accommodations if the water has been boiled, bottled or chemically treated. If he or she is unsure, seek a source that you know is safe. Use the same procedure for bottled or canned carbonated beverages. Check the seal of bottled and canned drinks to make sure that the seal isn’t broken. If it is, opt for a bottle or can that is clearly sealed. Consider wiping off the outside of the container before drinking bottled or canned beverages.Stay away from tap water and fountain drinks as they could contain contaminated water.Avoid ice cubes at all costs, as this can transmit the bacteria easily.; , You may not be able to find or access clean water sources. If this is the case, you can also safely disinfect your own water through methods such as boiling or filtering it.Disinfect your water by:   Boiling it for one minute Filtering it and adding two drops of household bleach or ½ iodine tablet per liter.  You may also find yourself in a remote area, perhaps while you are hiking, with no supplies such as a filter, bleach, or pot and pan. In these cases, you can use water purification tablets or powders. These are small and easy to carry. You may want to purchase them before you leave, as they may not be available once you are abroad.   Read the package labeling to see the strength of your specific purification tablet or powder. Consult the chart on the package to learn how many tabs you’ll need to purify the water you want to use. Remove the tablet from the strip and put it in the water. Stir with a clean utensil and cover your water. Wait 30 minutes before drinking and make sure to consume all of the water within 24 hours of purification. Consider using a chlorine liquid purifier called Dlo Lavi if you are in Haiti. Use one capful of the product per 5 gallons (20 liters) in clear water or two capfuls per 5 gallons (20 liters) if the water is very dirty or cloudy. As with purification tabs, stir the water with a clean utensil and cover it while waiting 30 minutes for your disinfected water. Again, make sure to use all of the purified water within 24 hours.  Whenever you disinfect or purify water, it’s important that it remains clean. Covering any purified source with a tight light can protect the water and ensure that it remains safe to use. This is also the case for sources like bottled water or canned beverages.  Just as drinking water contaminated with the cholera bacteria can make you sick, so can eating food prepared or cleaned in contaminated water. Try and eat only foods cooked freshly and completely through. Make sure any dishes are hot when they arrive to you.Make sure any food you purchase from street vendors is cooked in front of you and is served hot. Stay away from any raw or undercooked meats and seafood.This includes sushi.You may want to avoid all seafood in endemic areas. Consider pre-packaged foods if you are unsure of a food source., Most people love fruits and vegetables, which can also be a good alternative for a person who may not like or be unsure of meat. But just as it’s important to eat thoroughly cooked foods, so it is to check your fruits and vegetables to ensure they are not contaminated with cholera.Stay away from unpeeled fruits and vegetables. This includes salads or dishes with fruits like grapes and berries. If any unpeeled fruits or vegetables are in a dish, make sure they’re thoroughly cooked.Consider sticking to fruits and vegetables that you can peel yourself such as bananas, oranges, and avocados.  Dairy foods such as ice cream are often contaminated with cholera. Staying away from dairy products and unpasteurized milk may minimize your risk of cholera. If you want to consume dairy, make sure it comes from a known source and is both sealed and pasteurized before consumption., If you are traveling to a specific region of the world that still experiences cholera outbreaks, it may be useful to check to see if there is a current cholera outbreak. This can remind you to be extra vigilant about taking preventative measures to avoid contracting cholera.   Call the country’s embassy or local consulate or consult its website. Either may be able to provide you with information on cholera outbreaks. The United States Department of State provides a list of all embassies and consulates in the US at http://www.state.gov/s/cpr/rls/dpl/32122.htm. Consult the websites of international organizations that track health issues and often have information on current cholera outbreaks. These include the World Health Organization or International Committee of the Red Cross.You can also call the CDC at 877-FYI-TRIP (394-8747) or visit their website for travelers at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel.  If you’re in areas with a known cholera outbreak or with unsanitary water, it’s important to be especially vigilant about washing your hands. This can minimize your risk of contracting the disease or spreading it to someone else. You can use either soap and water or hand cleanerWash with clean water and soap. Rub your soapy, wet hands together for at least 20 seconds. Clean between your fingers, under your nails, and up your wrists. Make sure to rinse thoroughly.Use an alcohol-based hand cleanser if no water is available. Make sure that is at least 60% alcohol. Consider buying sanitizer before you leave so that you have it on hand if you get into a situation where you don’t have water but can’t buy sanitizer.Make sure to clean your hands when you prepare food, before you eat, and any time you use the restroom.  Dishes washed in water contaminated with cholera can also infect food placed on them, and in turn you. Make sure that you or anyone with whom you are traveling washes dishes in bottled, boiled, or chemically treated water., You’ll need to maintain your own hygiene while traveling and brushing your teeth is a vital part of that. Brushing your teeth with water from unknown or dirty sources can also increase your risk of getting cholera.Remember that exposure to even a small amount of water contaminated with cholera can infect you, even if it’s just to brush your teeth. Use only bottled, boiled, or chemically treated water to brush your teeth. If these aren’t available, consider carrying some portable brushes that have toothpaste that you can chew or even chewing a piece of gum. Use these until you can find a safe water source to brush your teeth.  There is a relatively low risk of contracting cholera when you are traveling and most doctors don’t recommend getting vaccinated. If you are especially concerned about the disease or going to be in an area with a cholera outbreak for an extended period, such as doing missionary or humanitarian work, you may want to consider getting a cholera vaccine. Be aware that the traditional injected version is only minimally effective at preventing cholera. In addition, the two oral vaccines are not available in the United States.Talk to your doctor or local health care provider if you are interested in the vaccines. The two oral cholera vaccines that the WHO has prequalified are Dukoral and ShanKoe. Be aware that no country requires immunization for cholera as a condition of entry.  If you show any of the signs or symptoms of cholera, get to a doctor immediately. Cholera can quickly turn fatal, even in the healthiest individuals. Seeing a doctor can ensure you get proper and prompt treatment if you do have cholera or another disease.Tell the doctor why you are visiting the office. Let him or her know what your symptoms are and when they started. You may also want to inform the doctor if you’ve had any dirty water and if you’ve been using methods such as purification tabs to clean your water. The symptoms of cholera include large volume depletion through rice-water-colored diarrhea. It is imperative that supportive measures be taken to replenish hydration and electrolyte loss, as dehydration can be fatal.  

drink only from sources of clean water.  disinfect your water.  purify your water with tablets.  keep water sources covered.  eat completely cooked and hot food.  take care with fruits and vegetables.  avoid dairy.  inform yourself about ongoing outbreaks.  wash your hands frequently.  keep dishes uncontaminated with clean water.  brush teeth with water from clean sources.  consider vaccination.  seek medical attention. 

 File the pointed tip of the seed down to one layer using a standard metal file. If you do not scar the seed, it will not grow and may rot.; , The water should not be chlorinated and must be changed every day until the lotus seeds sprout. After the first day of soaking, the seeds should swell to nearly twice their original size.   Seeds that float are almost always infertile. File any floating seeds down until you see a hint of the white meat on the inside of the seed. If these seeds do not swell like the others, discard them to avoid letting them cloud up the water.  You must be more delicate than before to avoid disturbing the growth, however. Growth should start after four or five days of soaking, but you will need to wait a few more days until the seedling is at least 6 in. (15.24 cm) long before transferring.  A 3 to 5 gallon (11 to 19 liter) container should provide a young lotus plant with enough room to grow. A black plastic bucket works best because of its ability to retain heat and warm the seedlings. You also need to choose a bucket that does not have any drainage holes. The plant can actually gravitate toward the drainage holes and begin growing outside of them, causing the plant to under-perform.  Lotus seeds without an anchor may find their way out of the soil and end up floating on the surface of the water. Gently wrap a small amount of modeling clay around each seed, but do not cover the sprout.  The ideal soil is about two parts clay and one part river sand. Fill the pot with about 6 in. (15.24 cm) of this potting medium.  The seeds should rest near the top of the soil, but you should brush a light layer of soil over the seeds after you press them in.  The water should be a maximum of 18 in. (45.72 cm) deep and at a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21.1 degrees Celsius).  

scar the seeds.  place the seeds into a glass of warm water.  continue changing the water daily even after the seeds sprout.  pick the right pot.  anchor the seeds.  fill your pot with dense soil.  gently press the seeds into the top of the soil.  lower the pot into shallow water. 

 Collect as much armor and as many heavy weapons as you can.; , Keep you weak points pointing away from your enemies.  A gang-rush is effective against slow-moving tanks. You will want to avoid that as much as possible.  This will give lighter units less area to hide in and stealth units fewer things to hide behind.  

invest in high armor, long range, and heavy hits.  think like a naval captain for maneuvering.  keep a moderate distance from enemies.  level closed in areas and destroy as much cover as possible. 

 In North America, the most common types of dangerous house spiders are the black widow and the brown recluse, but learn the types of venomous spiders in your area and how to distinguish them from harmless house spiders.Female black widows have shiny black coloring, with a distinctive red hourglass-shaped pattern on their underside. Males have a mixture of whitish dots on the upper abdomen, are typically about half the size of female spiders, and are not as dangerous as the female. The brown recluse is a small sandy-brown spider with a violin-shaped body found primarily in the Midwest and South. They typically reside in tight, out-of-the-way spaces.In Australia, the redback spider is a common and dangerous spider that ends up in people's houses. Other spiders to watch out for might include the hobo spider and the wolf spider.; , Fresh webs, as opposed to old dust-covered cobwebs, are signs of current spider activity. By learning a bit about the webs of the particular kinds of spiders you're looking out for (or the lack thereof) you can prepare your plan of attack for undesirable spiders.          Black widow webs are usually irregularly shaped and somewhat thicker than other spider's webs, and usually located within one foot of the ground. The webs of black widows are typically in dry corners and other safe areas, not out in the open and easy to find, and usually look somewhat erratic, with a tunneling feature where the spider hides during the day. Brown recluse webs are loose and sticky, with an off-white color. You won't see them strung between tree branches or in the corner of the house, but in "reclusive" spots like under boxes, in woodpiles, or other unused out of the way areas. Large and intricate webs are the hallmark of the harmless orb-weaver spider, a helpful bug-catcher. Leave these spiders alone, or gently migrate them elsewhere.  Black widows are typically nocturnal spiders and the brown recluse rarely comes out of hiding. If you've got a large brownish hairy spider building a conspicuous web in the middle of the day, you probably don't need to worry.          If you're worried you've got a dangerous spider, check the webs in the middle of the day when the spider will be dormant. At this point, you can either lay out liquid or powder insecticide, or you can come back at night to kill them directly if you want to be sure.  Most spiders you encounter on a daily basis will be harmless. Move them outdoors where they can do more insect-catching good by trapping them in a jar or sweeping them onto a piece of paper and dumping them outside.          Get a large bowl or pan and sweep the spider into it with a broom. Use a magazine or newspaper large enough to cover the bowl to keep the spider from escaping prematurely, and then release it outside, far from your house if you wish. If you want to kill the spider without smashing it, you can fill your bowl or pan with insecticide, killing the spider as you capture it. You could also spray the spider at this point with insecticide or hairspray. Only do this if the spider is harmful.  Available in dry dusting and liquid spot varieties, you can lay this out when you find the webs during the day. This is an effective method that doesn't require you to actively run around squashing spiders with a flashlight.          Dust applications like Drione Dust and Delta Dust are best for out of the way areas where only spiders will go, like under staircases or in attic spaces. Apply these insecticides with hand brushes in wall voids near the webs to make the locations uninhabitable for the spiders. Liquid spot treatments like Demon WP and Cynoff EC can be used to spray under beds and in dark corners. These are usually sold in powder form, with specific instructions to mix with water and form the spray. For a natural alternative, try diatomaceous earth, which consists of the powdered fossilized remains of diatoms. It is harmless to people and other pets, and is even used in some foods and cat litters, but dehydrates the exoskeletons of insects and arachnids.After you've eradicated your spiders, it's not a bad idea to treat the areas with insecticide as a preventative measure. Spiders tend to pick the same areas to colonize, so you might cut them off at the pass by spraying or laying some insecticide down.  A good vacuum with a hose attachment means you can get rid of your spiders without ever having to get too close to them. Even if the spider is hiding in its tunnel, you can use the vacuum to suck out all the webbing and the spiders within it.          This is also an effective method for vacuuming up lots of house spider hatchlings that would be difficult to kill or migrate otherwise. Once you've vacuumed spiders, remove the vacuum bag and seal it in a plastic garbage bag, and put it outside in the garbage.  Sometimes you've just got to go old-school and use your shoe. If the spider is in its web, use a broom or stick to sweep the spider out into the open and use a shoe, rolled up newspaper, or book to smash the spider. It may be inelegant, but at least you'll be sure you've got it.          Black widows might have a tendency to head toward you if you miss, so be quick and keep your distance from dangerous spiders. Be careful to inspect the spider before squashing it, as a pregnant one may release its hatch-lings upon being smashed  , Since spiders like dark and undisturbed areas to build their webs, keeping a clean house is the best way to avoid infestation. Regularly sweep and mop your home, as well as vacuuming out small cracks and wall gaps. From the outside, power wash your windows to keep critters from congregating.          In the attic, basement, or anywhere you have lots of stuff and boxes stored, regularly move things around and vacuum to avoid creating spider habitats. Remove unnecessary clutter and stay tidy to eliminate the kinds of habitats spiders love. Consider spreading insecticide in those areas if you're worried about cultivating habitats. Outside, trim back shrubs and other foliage around your house, especially that nearest entrances. If you have firewood stacked anywhere near the house, consider moving it elsewhere. These are places spiders tend to congregate, and if they have easy access to the house, they'll be able to make the jump quickly.  Plug any gaps with weather stripping to make sure you've got a secure home and aren't letting unwanted pests easy access to your house.          Consider spreading some insecticide into any cracks before you seal them. Use stick-on weather stripping or caulk to create the seal.  Natural spider repellants are easy to make, use, and will ensure that your home stays spider free, so you won't have to worry about killing them or moving them elsewhere.         Add 3-5 drops of an essential oil like tea tree, peppermint, or lemon to a quart of water to clean your house with. These are harmless to people and pets, but create an undesirable scent for insects and spiders. Plant eucalyptus and spread horse chestnuts. Many people believe that eucalyptus is a natural spider replant, and some studies have shown that saponin--a naturally-occuring chemical found in horse chestnuts--repels spiders.  Make a spider spray for spraying on the outside of windows and doors, and along fences and mailboxes. Mix and pour the following in a spray bottle:          1 cup vinegar 1 cup pepper 1 teaspoon oil 1 teaspoon liquid soap.  

learn the common types of dangerous spiders.  study the webs.  learn the spider's behavior.  migrate harmless spiders and kill dangerous ones.  lay out insecticide.  vacuum the spiders up.  squash it.  clean frequently.  check your doors and windows for cracks.  use natural deterrents in your home and yard.  make a spider spray. 

 Lean proteins are foods that are relatively low in fat and calories per serving.When attempting to lose weight while focusing on meat-based foods, it's important to choose leaner meats over high fat meats the majority of the time. This can help keep your weight and cholesterol in check. Select non-fatty, lean meats such as:   Seafood. This is an excellent source of protein. Choose shellfish (like shrimp or crab) in addition to finfish (like flounder, tuna or mahimahi). In addition, some fish like salmon or mackerel, contain heart-healthy omega 3-fatty acids which have been shown to decrease the risk for heart disease.Poultry. Like turkey and chicken is also a great source of lean protein. Choose skinless, white meat options for the lowest fat content. Pork. Most pork has very little fat or marbling throughout the meat.Cut away or remove any excess fat for the lowest fat option. Red meat like beef or lamb. These proteins can also be considered a lean - especially if you're choosing lean cuts or 97/3 lean ground items. In addition, lean beef contains an abundance of zinc, iron and vitamin B12., Organic meat products, in general, are slightly more expensive than conventionally raised and processed meat products. However, organic meat is free of growth hormones, additives and preservatives.Look for the USDA seal of approval, which means that the animal was fed 100% organic food and was free-range. Do note that organic meat has no nutritional difference when compared with conventional meat. However, free-range meat is typically higher in omega 3 and 6.  Eating a serving of lean meat at every meal or snack will give you the foundation for a weight loss diet focused on meat.   To maintain a balanced and varied diet, eat a variety of proteins throughout the day. For example, you may have eggs for breakfast, a grilled chicken salad at lunch, beef jerky as a snack and grilled salmon and vegetables for dinner. Other foods that are also high in protein (like dairy products, beans or tofu) can be included in some of your meals. Whether you choose to include them will be based on how you create and design your diet.  Oil and sauces (like marinades or dressings) can contain a significant amount of added fat, sugar and calories. Limit the amount of oil and sauces you cook with to manage the overall calorie content of your meals.   For the lowest calorie method, lightly brush the meat with a small amount of olive oil prior to cooking it. Or, try sautéing lean protein in a non-stick pan with the addition of some no-calorie cooking spray. Fresh or dried herbs and citrus are healthful ways to add a lot of flavor to meat dishes without adding a lot of calories or sodium. Avoid added excessive amounts of sauce to serve meat with. Even though you may love ketchup or barbecue sauce, both contain a lot of sugar which may counteract your weight loss goals. Instead look for alternatives that contain little to no sugar and calories. You can also try making these sauces from scratch to control the sugar and calories.  Fruits and vegetables are essential to a healthy, nutritious and well-balanced diet. Even when choosing a meat-based weight loss diet, it's important to consume adequate amounts of fruits and vegetables each day. These foods are high in fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that are vital for your health.   1 cup of raw or 2 cups of leafy green vegetables are considered a serving.Aim to consume two to three servings daily.1 small whole fruit, 1 cup of sliced fruit and 1/2 cup of dried fruit counts as one serving. Aim to consume one to two servings of fruit daily., Many weight loss diets that focus on meat or are high protein are also low-carb diets. You may choose to limit how many carbohydrates you consume - especially from the grain group. However, if you choose to consume grains, choose 100% whole grains over processed grains.   Whole grains are minimally processed and contain all the parts of the grain: the bran, the germ and the endosperm. They are generally higher in fiber, vitamins and minerals compared to more refined grains.Whole grain foods include: 100% whole wheat bread or pasta, quinoa, brown rice, barley, or millet.  

purchase lean cuts of meat.  purchase organic meat.  incorporate one portion of meat into every meal.  cook meat without additional oils and sauces.  eat a variety of fruits and vegetables.  eat 100% whole grains. 

 One of the most common forms of biphobia is the denial of the very existence of bisexuality. Sometimes this denial is caused by malice, but just as often it is the result of misinformation.   Reputable studies clearly indicate that bisexuality is a very real fact of life for many people. Actually, one recent study revealed that more Americans self-identify as bisexual (3.1%) than gay or lesbian (2.5%). This would indicate that there are roughly ten million self-identified bisexuals in the U.S.Often, a denial of bisexuality is based more on the assumption that it is a temporary situation within a transition between hetero- and homosexuality. The typical view in this sense is that “bisexual” simply means “on the way to gay.”However, although it may not fit neatly into the binary views of existence (gay / straight, male / female, etc.) that many people tend to embrace, bisexuality is a very real state of being in and of itself.; , Those who do accept the existence of genuine bisexuality, and may even consider themselves supportive, can still harbor misconceptions and stereotypes that can add up to a less virulent but still harmful biphobia. Curiosity and questions should be welcomed, but “loaded” questions that indicate a prejudicial point of view need not be seen as acceptable.Some assumptions are clearly prejudicial, such as saying that a bisexual is just “confused” or “lying to himself,” needs to “make up her mind already,” is “trying to have it all” or avoid the difficulties of being identified as homosexual, is “just going through a phase,” or is just “trying to look cool.” Even if there is supportive intent, such statements denigrate the distinctive existence of bisexuality. You have every right to respond to such questions or views by clarifying that bisexuals are not “undecided” or “confused” — they are living life on their terms. Don’t be hostile or judgmental yourself, especially when dealing with someone who wants to be supportive; educate them on what it means to be bisexual.  Many people simply place people in the binary categories of “heterosexual” or “not heterosexual,” often with the first option as the only “right” one. In so doing, they conflate homosexuals, bisexuals, and anyone else who does not fit neatly into these two supposedly rigid categories.Some people will simply have trouble believing that a bisexual is anything other than a homosexual who is literally “trying to have it both ways” out of confusion or convenience. Be prepared to address the differences between homosexuality and bisexuality, while confirming their equal rights to respect and tolerance. Even as a bisexual (or advocate for them), then, it pays to understand common prejudices more specifically targeted toward homosexuals as well. See How to Deal With Homophobia as a good reference.  Not surprisingly, you will find some of the strongest champions for bisexual rights among the gay and lesbian communities. At the same time, however, some people who crusade against homophobia can actually espouse strong biphobia, for various reasons.Advocates for gay and lesbian equality sometimes express biphobia because they see bisexuals as only “half” of an oppressed minority, or because they are defensive about guarding the unity and priorities of their specific cause.Homosexuals can be misinformed about bisexuality just as easily as heterosexuals, but are perhaps more likely to respond to reasoned discussions of the challenges and prejudices bisexuals face on a daily basis.  While a good deal of biphobia will be based on misinformation, confusion, or good intentions improperly expressed, it can be expressed in more virulent forms as well. Bullies target differences and perceived weaknesses, often seeking to avoid or ignore their fears or problems by attacking others.Identifying the likely causes of someone’s biphobic bullying can help you to counteract it. Understanding does not mean accepting or legitimizing the bullying, though. Consider factors like peer pressure, social / religious background, or factors unrelated to bisexuality that may be causing the person to lash out at a perceived “flaw” in someone else.  If you’re lucky, a healthy conversation with the bully may be enough to convince him to stop the behavior — if not necessarily change his mind on bisexuality. But, if you are subject to ongoing bullying (for whatever reason), never hesitate to talk to people you trust, like friends, teachers, counselors, etc.If you are harmed or fear for your safety, by all means contact the authorities. No one has to tolerate bullying.  

deny their denials.  address common misconceptions.  plan for biphobia conflated with homophobia.  counter possible biphobia from supporters of gay and lesbian rights.  understand bullying motivations.  don't stand for bullying, though.

 You cannot wear high heels or any type of sandal to visit CERN, so pay attention to your footwear. Sturdy, flat shoes are the best plan, though you can wear low heels that are squared off rather than pointed., CERN is in both France and Switzerland. While you're taking your tour, you might go across this border, so it's important to carry your passport with you. If you traveled from another country, inquire if you need a visa to visit either of these countries., Luggage isn't allowed on the premises at CERN, so you'll need to leave it behind. However, you can can bring purses and other small handbags, as well as cameras.Pets should also be left behind.  Some areas of CERN may not be accessible to you under certain conditions, so you need to let them know in advance of your tour. For instance, if you have limited mobility, are pregnant, or have a pacemaker, you may not be able to visit some areas. If you have a ferromagnetic implant, you also need to let them know.Also contact them if you have anyone under 16 in your group.  

wear sturdy close-toed shoes.  bring your passport and visa with you.  store your luggage at your hotel.  prepare cern if you have special needs. 

 There is no person in the world that doesn't like listening to good music. But composing good music is a whole other topic. Have you ever tried playing an instrument?  ,, Maybe this is your best skill and you haven't known until today.  

turn on the radio.  save some money, buy a guitar and have free lessons on youtube or other online websites that can help you.  ,  start songwriting too. 

 Asking questions is one of the best ways to improve conversation with your partner. You should ask each other questions every day about how work went, how you both are feeling, and other day-to-day "updates" about one another's lives. You should also ask questions to clarify something that was said, or to dig deeper and get your partner to open up more.Use prodding questions. Start out with larger, more general topics, and work your way down to more specific revelations. You might start by asking your girlfriend how her day was, then ask about an incident that was unpleasant or a happy moment at work. Once your girlfriend starts to talk about the specifics of her day, you can try applying the things she says to other conversations you've had. For example, you might ask, "That's happened before, hasn't it?" or "Wow, I can't believe that happened after _____ told you something different last week." Ask your girlfriend how she feels about the events she describes. Let her know you care, and offer her your support.; , A big problem in relationship communication is one partner not feeling heard or understood. Rephrasing what your girlfriend just said in your own words shows that you are listening to and processing everything she's saying. It can also be a useful way to help mentally ground yourself in the conversation if you find that your thoughts are racing and you're having a hard time focusing on what's being said.Use a natural conversational tone. If your partner interprets your rephrasing as mocking, the conversation can go bad very quickly. Try to limit your use of rephrasing. If done too often it can be distracting or irritating. Put your girlfriend's words into your own words when you rephrase them. This shows that you're processing everything she says, and not simply repeating it word for word. You might try using a transitional phrase to begin your rephrasing. For example, try saying something like, "So what you're saying is..." or "I think I understand where you're coming from. You're saying ________. Is that right?"  , Body language often speaks just as loudly as words. The way that you and your girlfriend position yourselves during the conversation can send signals that may be unintentional, or may reflect your subconscious mood. Try not to read too obsessively into your partner's body language, but if it seems like there is a problem, try asking her if she's upset and let her know that you noticed her body language.If your girlfriend crosses her arms, she may be feeling defensive, distant, or emotionally closed off from you. Avoiding eye contact may indicate a lack of interest in what you're saying, shame over something that was said or done, or feeling distracted or uncommunicative. Turning the body away during a conversation may suggest that your partner feels disinterested, frustrated, or emotionally closed off. A loud, aggressive tone might indicate that the conversation has escalated or is about to escalate, and emotions are running high. Your girlfriend may also feel that you're not hearing her or understanding her. Some body language positions are incidental, so don't "accuse" your girlfriend of secretly being upset or closed off. Ask in a caring way by saying something like, "I noticed your body language seems to suggest that you're upset, but your words are contradicting that. Is something on your mind?"  , Being honest means not lying to or misleading your girlfriend, which should be easy enough. But being open requires you to make yourself vulnerable on some level, which many people struggle with. If being open and honest doesn't come naturally to you, you'll need to work on it with your partner for the sake of your relationship.Open, honest communication is the foundation of a strong relationship. If you cannot be open and honest with one another, you will inevitably encounter problems down the line. Tell your girlfriend the full truth. Don't hold back or withhold your feelings, because she may be upset if she finds out about it. If you're struggling with being open, let your partner know about the problem and try to explain the reasons why. If she knows you struggle with it, she can be extra supportive, and may learn to ask you prompting questions or request elaborations.  Many people are in such a hurry to get all their thoughts/feelings out in the open that they fail to pause and reflect on what's being said. This is true of both speaking your mind in general, as well as speaking in response to something your girlfriend has said.Think carefully about what it is you want to say before you speak. Be aware of what you're feeling when you talk to your girlfriend. Speak as clearly and directly as possible. If you're responding to something your partner said, give her a second to make sure she's finished talking. Then take a brief second to process what she's said and think about how to best articulate your response.  You should always strive to be as respectful as possible in every conversation you have with your girlfriend. Respect may be an obvious requirement for many people, but it's important to be aware of your words, your tone, the subtext of your conversation, and your body language to always convey mutual respect for one another.Take responsibility for what you say and do during a conversation, even if it escalates to an argument. You should both fully express your thoughts and feelings, but you need to do so respectfully. Validate your partner's feelings. Try to understand why your girlfriend feels the way she does, and at the very least respect the fact that she feels that way.Convey a respectful posture. Don't slouch, avoid eye contact, or do other tasks while listening to your girlfriend. Face her and give her your full attention. Be respectful in any responses you give. Don't interrupt your girlfriend, and never say that she's wrong to feel a certain way. If there's any kind of misunderstanding between you, don't get mad or upset. Instead, you should calmly ask questions and try to get your girlfriend to clarify what she means.  When emotions rise, especially during a fight or after you've been hurt somehow, it's easy to slip into declarative statements (such as "You are a liar and you hurt my feelings."). But psychologists agree that using "I" statements are far more effective and cause less tension. Using an "I" statement simply means framing your hurt feelings as a way that you feel, rather than as an accusation or an absolute about your partner.A good "I" statement should include the following components:   A statement of emotion ("I feel _____") A fair and unemotional description of the behavior causing you to feel the way you feel ("I feel _____ when you ______") An explanation of why the behavior or conditions at hand cause you to feel the way you do ("I feel ____ when you _____, because it _________")  , If you haven't been dating for a long time, or if you are new to sharing your feelings in general, it's best to take things slowly. You should still work on communicating with one another every day, but you and your partner should have a frank conversation about how comfortable you are with divulging your personal thoughts/feelings, and what kind of time frame you might need to get to that point.Don't rush into deep, troubling, or difficult conversations. Let them come naturally when you're both ready to talk about such things. Don't rush your partner, and don't let her rush you. Go by what you are both comfortable with, and know that any effort at improving communication will help strengthen your relationship.  Self-disclosure statements can be very useful in a relationship, especially if you're new to sharing your feelings or talking about deeply personal things. They're a way for you to reveal yourself incrementally but candidly to your partner, with the assumption that she will talk about herself as well.Try building off of the following self-disclosing cues to get started:   I am a person who _____. One thing I wish people knew about me is _______. When I try to express intimate feelings, _____________.  There are many different ways of communicating, and there are no absolute right or wrong methods. However, some methods can be more productive than others for some people, and it may take some experimentation to find a style of communication that works best for both of you.Try being expressive. Let your partner know how you feel, and ask her how she feels. Use task- or fact-oriented communication. Some people are more comfortable conveying facts instead of emotions, like saying, "I feel like I'm not making enough money at my job" instead of saying, "I'm sad and I'm worried about my finances." Be assertive. Assertive communication involves the clear and direct communication of your feelings, opinions, and needs, without infringing on the rights of your partner. Avoid passive communication. This communication style involves a failure to assert yourself or express your thoughts/feelings/needs, and can be very damaging to the relationship.Minimize emotion before talking about important things. Take a few minutes to calm down before discussing anything significant so that your emotions do not direct the conversation, but make sure you do acknowledge the way you and your partner feel., Small talk is tremendously helpful in any relationship, and it helps build a day-to-day level of communication within your relationship. You can reminisce or laugh about shared experiences, talk about what you each did that day, ask about plans for the weekend, or simply share observations that you find interesting or funny.Small talk about your day-to-day lives helps you and your girlfriend get closer and know each other more intimately. Ask your girlfriend to elaborate and give more details. Make sure that your follow-up questions convey a genuine interest in what your girlfriend says and does not come across as suspicious or distrustful.  Many people with busy lives or different schedules find that the lines of communication get strained in a relationship. This can easily be remedied, though, if both partners make time for communication. Even if you have very hectic lives, it's important that you make some time for open, honest communication, the same way you make time for meals, sleep, or your daily commute.If having a rigid schedule helps you both maintain your day-to-day lives, try scheduling alone time. Set aside some alone time at least once every week to keep a healthy, open line of communication. Try to limit interruptions when you're talking with your girlfriend. Turn off the TV or radio, and silence/put away your cellphones so you won't be distracted. Talk to one another while doing day-to-day activities, like while driving in the car or doing chores around the house. Notice when your girlfriend acts troubled or otherwise seems to have something she wants to talk about. Ask if something is wrong, or if there's anything she'd like to talk about. Make sure your conversations convey commitment, trust, and intimacy from both of you., You might find that communication doesn't come easily in your relationship, or that the lines of communication have been strained by life events. There is nothing wrong with this, and it does not mean your relationship won't work - it simply means you might need to try a little harder. That's where a professional may be of service.A licensed couples therapist can help you and your girlfriend find ways to be more open and communicative. You may also work on being more honest, taking more of an interest in one another's lives, and finding more time to spend alone together. You can find therapists in your area by looking through the phone book, using a search engine online, or by consulting a therapy-based index like Psychology Today has on their website. 

ask questions.  rephrase to reflect.  look for nonverbal signals.  be open and honest.  reflect before you speak.  communicate respectfully.  focus on "i" statements.  don't rush things.  use self-disclosure statements.  try out different communication styles.  focus on small talk.  make time for communication.  consider seeking professional help. 

 These days, you have a variety of webinar programs to choose from. Select something user-friendly that most distance attendees have installed. Make sure you've chosen software with a video component if the call includes slides. If installed software isn't a realistic option, go with a service that everyone can freely access online.   To accommodate attendees without software requirements, make sure the call takes place in a room with a speaker phone. This dial-in option will also be a handy backup if the webinar software fails.; , Pick three to five potential dates and times of day. Send an email to all participants to gauge their availability for each possibility. Tell anyone who can't make any of the times to let you know as soon as possible.You can also use online scheduling surveys like Doodle. These tools allow attendees to choose dates and times with the click of a mouse. If you choose this option, don't forget to include the link in the email. If all attendees are in the same time zone, avoid planning calls during lunch breaks, immediately at the beginning of the work day, and or after normal business hours.  Include topics that need to be discussed. Cover any questions or concerns you anticipate from other members. Focus on the positive issues first. Then, address challenges and offer solutions or ideas to overcome any obstacles.If you plan to assign any tasks to certain attendees, discuss it with them before you send out the agenda. The last thing you want to do is catch someone by surprise or give a manager or client incorrect information.  Include everything they'll require to log into the call, such as the call-in number and password. Attach a draft of the agenda to the email. Ask that everyone read over it and notify you if they want to add something or revise existing content., Choose the most responsible and attentive physical attendee for this task. Make sure they include the names of everyone present. Have them summarize major points discussed, using the agenda as an outline.If they have a digital audio recorder or record function on their phone, ask them to use it if no sensitive material will be discussed. Don't skip this step if you're using the record function on the webinar software. Technology can fail when you least expect it. If that happens, you'll have written minutes as a backup.  Do this on the day of the call if it's after lunch or the day before a call scheduled in the morning. Use this opportunity to send any reports or documents that will be needed on the call. It's your responsibility to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that everyone has completed their responsibilities before the call.If someone else created these materials, give them credit (or prevent blame from falling on you) by forwarding their message containing the documents.  Flesh out items already on the agenda to keep yourself from losing focus. Don't draft a prepared statement. Stick to a bulleted list of key points, short imperatives, and incomplete sentences. This will prevent you from sounding mechanical.Some examples include:    Current state of hiring needs: Accounting now fully staffed. Still need new manager in Marketing and new administrative assistant in Advertising. Budget limit = $100,000 total for both openings.  Benefits changes: Head office phasing out 401k. Instituting new 403b plan for new hires. Health, dental, vision insurance unchanged for now but still under review.  Include where they're from and general personal information about them. Use this info as you introduce everyone to each other. You can also use this information to chat while you’re waiting on additional attendees to join.   Make a copy of this list for your note-taker. Instead of taking the time to write out everyone's name, the note-taker can simply check off each person's name as they arrive or log in.  Don't wait until the last minute. Start reviewing the information the day after you finish your notes and/or presentation. Try committing the major points to memory so that you can discuss them without pausing to look at your paper or screen. Every second you save can be used for other presenters or for questions.  Make sure all equipment is present and working properly. Look for strategically positioned speakers if you're using a large room in anticipation of many attendees. If anything is missing or malfunctioning, notify the relevant department as soon as possible., Log on to the conference call 10 minutes early, if possible. Some tools won’t let you log on until the time scheduled. Others won’t let anyone communicate until a leader with a special password logs in. Test the bridge one last time to make sure it's running smoothly.If you don't know how to use the equipment, learn a few days ahead of time. Get help from your company's IT department, if necessary. Not knowing how to operate the software or hardware can make you look unprofessional., Have some notes handy to initiate small talk at the beginning of the call. Introduce all attendees by their names, titles, and roles they play. If anyone arrives or joins the call after the five-minute delay, don't interrupt a discussion in progress. Wait until after a speaker has finished or a topic has ended to allow latecomers to introduce themselves., Ask attendees dialing in to mute their phones to avoid background noise. Request that they avoid using the hold button to prevent broadcasting their company's hold music. Tell everyone physically present to silence their cell phones and keep them away from the meeting phone to prevent interference. Make sure all attendees speak audibly and clearly so that everyone can hear them., Keep an eye on the clock to accommodate the needs of attendees and presenters. Cover the most important issues first in case you run out of time. If anyone asks a question you can't answer or weren't expecting, tell them you'll get back to them as soon as possible., Don't wait until the end of the call to do this. Do it right before you get to questions and answers (Q&A) on the agenda. Ask everyone the most convenient date and time for the next call. If most attendees are undecided, send out a scheduling survey after the call., In a conference call, you might have trouble getting everyone to participate. To prevent this from happening, don't ask if anyone has any questions. Rather, ask specific people relevant to the topic of discussion a question.For example, you could ask, “Bob, have you gotten all of the information you need to create the topic text?”  , Start to wrap up about five minutes before the scheduled ending time. If Q&A is still in progress, tell everyone you have time for one more question. Thank everyone for their time and wish them a good day or week(end)., Start doing this immediately after the call. Ask your note-taker for a copy of the minutes. Make sure you include a list of everyone's responsibilities. The minutes will document the conversation in writing in case there are any discrepancies later.Ask a colleague to proofread the recap before you send it out. A second pair of eyes can catch mistakes you might have overlooked, no matter how many times you've proofread the material.  Do this as soon as you've made any edits your proofreader has recommended. Invite all recipients to make comments or ask questions that might have slipped their minds during the call. If you promised to send out a scheduling survey for a follow-up call, include that link with the recap., Take action as discussed during the call. If you promised to answer any questions at a later date, follow up within no more than a week. Meet any deadlines you set. Make sure any promised work is delivered to the proper recipients within a reasonable amount of time.  

pick a convenient conferencing software.  poll your attendees for a convenient time.  write an agenda.  email preliminary info to all attendees.  appoint a note-taker.  send a reminder email.  draft your notes or talking points.  make a list of attendees.  review any information you’ll be presenting.  survey the room a day or two before the call.  set up the call.  allow five extra minutes for latecomers.  review meeting etiquette.  stick to the agenda.  schedule a follow-up call, if necessary.  allow at least 15 minutes for q&a.  close the call.  create a recap.  send the recap to all attendees.  follow through on promises and deadlines. 

 Write down the chores you need to do.; , Arrange your list into categories. Prioritize what is most important to do first.  Decide how long each chore will take and try to complete each one within that specified amount of time. Play a game with yourself by competing against time.  Keep a steady pace. Multi-task in different situations. For example, when your laundry is in the dryer, start washing the dishes or take out the trash. While you're dusting, you can vacuum at the same time.  Think of ways to do each task more quickly. Learn to fold your clothes in the same way with speed. Stack the dishes so they'll dry more quickly. Make your bed in the most expedient manner.  Take pride in caring for your things and home. Your parents will be pleased when every task is done well. , If your clothes are dry, fold them and put them away. If the dishes are done drying, put them in the cupboard. Do everything on the list.  Congrats! You now have the whole Saturday to yourself., 

make a list.  organize your list.  give yourself a time limit.  tackle the list.  perfect each task.  do a good job.  as you complete each task, check or cross them off from your list.  ,  finish up.  when you are finished, show your parents the chores that have been completed.  relax, watch television or visit your friends.  

 There are three main categories of power of attorney. Each requires a specific legal form and authorizes a different scope of responsibilities. In each type of POA, the person giving the authority is the grantor or principal and the person who receives the responsibility is the grantee or agent., A general POA grants a wide and far-ranging scope of authority. A general POA allows the agent to make all decisions for the grantor except for anything listed in the POA as an exception. For example, a general POA can specify that the agent cannot sell or mortgage the grantor's real estate during the grantor's lifetime.   There is a difference between a regular and durable power of attorney. A regular power of attorney expires when the grantor becomes mentally incapacitated. A durable power of attorney continues in full force, regardless of the principal's health, until it is explicitly revoked or the grantor dies.In all cases, the power of attorney expires at the death of the grantor. A power of attorney cannot be used as a substitute for a will., This form of POA can be worded so that it does not go into effect until the grantor becomes mentally incapacitated. This is called a springing power of attorney because is "springs" into effect when certain conditions are met.You can define "incapacity" in the POA document. For example, you can require that one or more doctors examine you and make a diagnosis of your mental state and opinion on whether you will recover.  If you have an action or short period of time that you need to grant authority, consider a limited power of attorney. For example, a power of attorney might be granted to someone to handle your banking while you are out of the country on a job assignment. The POA will end when you come home. Another example is giving someone power of attorney to buy or sell property. The authority ends when the transaction is complete., That authority can range from authorizing treatment all the way up to making end-of-life decisions if you are too ill or injured to speak for yourself. The American Bar Association has created a step-by-step packet to guide a principal through the process of naming a medical POA agent.   The ABA medical power of attorney package is not valid in Indiana, New Hampshire, Ohio, Texas, and Wisconsin. Most hospitals have state-specific forms or you can consult with an attorney skilled in estate planning for assistance.  Once you determine the best POA format for your situation, you need to gather documentation about property and accounts for your agent. Necessary documentation for a general durable POA that will be in effect immediately may include checkbooks, bank statements, investment statements, property deeds, mortgage documents, household accounts, and titles and insurance for vehicles.   If the POA is sent to not go into effect until the incapacity of the grantor, the documents can be stored in a safe place that is accessible to the grantor and the agent.  At this stage you need to decide what authority you are willing to delegate and for what time period it will be valid. Without specific definition, a general POA will give your agent almost unfettered authority over your affairs.   It is a good idea to specifically empower your agent to be able to access your safe deposit box. It is a gray area in that it isn't a financial account and it isn't property. Depending on the banking laws and individual bank policy, your agent may be denied access to your safe deposit box without explicit authorization., Even if the principal and agent live in different states, the POA must conform to the state where it is granted. This will usually be the home state of the principal or where the property is located. Some states, like California, have detailed statutes on language that must be included in the power of attorney. To find your state's law, do an online search for "power of attorney statute for ".  Most POA agents are family members, but can also be a friend or someone else you trust. You want an agent who you can trust to handle your affairs when you are at your most vulnerable. Things to consider are availability, responsibility, willingness to assume the responsibility, and trustworthiness.   You can split authority between two or more agents. For example, someone can manage your household affairs, while someone else handles your investment accounts.  A durable power of attorney can be time-consuming and last for years if the principal becomes disabled or seriously ill. Your agents must be ready and willing to assume responsibilities for your accounts and act in your best interests.   An agent may be subject to civil and criminal penalties if they exploit the power of attorney authority for personal gain., The duties under durable power of attorney can last for years. Your agent may decide she doesn't want to do it anymore, may die, or move from the area. To provide a seamless transition in management of your affairs, you should name at least one alternate agent who is as responsible and trustworthy as the primary agent.   If your estate is large or complex, consider naming an estate or trust attorney as an alternate. The attorney will have the authority to manage your portfolio and vet and choose a new primary agent.  You will need a form that conforms to the laws of your state. If your estate is large or complex (for example, rental properties or extensive investments), you should have your power of attorney drafted by an estate attorney. Otherwise, for more typical estates, you can find forms online,through the Secretary of State office in many states,or from an office supply store.  Regardless of the state, a POA is not valid unless it has either a start date or a specific springing event such as mental incompetence. You should also have the names and addresses of your agent and at least two alternate agents.  A standard form will have the most common types of delegated authority, including banking, tax issues, and property management. If there are any standard provisions that do not apply, thoroughly line it out and initial the edit.   List out any other responsibilities, using additional pages if necessary, and attach them to the document. Typical responsibilities can be spelled out. "Pay all monthly utilities on ," or "File federal, state, and local tax returns in the name of the principal."  , Standard forms will also have some common restrictions and you can edit and add others to suit your specific situation. A common restriction forbids an agent from transferring property into his own name.There are some standard restrictions on the agent. For example, the agent must not co-mingle the principal's funds with her own. Other restrictions can be specific to the situation, such as, "Agent may not sell, mortgage, or otherwise encumber the homestead of the principal until after the principal's death" or "Agent may not delegate any authority to . If is allowed access to financial accounts, it renders this POA null and void."  , Some states require a notary for the POA to be valid. However, even if not required by state law, it is still a good idea because it eliminates questions about the validity of the signature and mental capacity of the principal.   Sign an original for the principal and each agent and alternate agent in blue ink to differentiate it from a copy. Most banks offer notary services to account holders. If the principal is in a nursing home or other medical facility, you should have an independent notary to avoid conflict of interest with the management of the facility. The agent will be able to make copies of the executed POA for all accounts as needed.  

determine what form of poa is right for the situation.  consider a general power of attorney.  explore a durable power of attorney.  specify a limited power of attorney.  draft a medical power of attorney to grant authority to make medical decisions.  gather your documentation.  establish the timeframe and parameters.  research the law in your state.  list possible agents.  talk with and screen your potential agents.  choose an alternate agent.  obtain the correct form.  fill in the basic required information.  detail the delegations of authority.  create the restrictions on the agent's authority.  sign the poa and notarize your signature.

 Google provides free analytics services to YouTube content creators, so they can track and analyze the kinds of people attracted to their videos. When you know a little more about them, you can make content that will appeal to that audience more directly. Google's analytics services provide information including:   approximate age gender geographical location  , Most people won't subscribe to channels with fuzzy audio and phone-quality video. If you're serious about having a successful channel, it's a good idea to invest in an HD video camera with a good microphone for recording audio. Read this article to learn more about good cameras for making videos.If you can't spend money on new camera and recording equipment, it's still important to make sure your videos are clear, steady, well-lit, and synched properly.  One thing you'll notice about a lot of successful YouTube content creators is that their videos are heavily edited. Most popular videos are not just long, single-takes. Lots of the jokes and style of the YouTube video come from quick jump-cuts and humorous little moments.   Often, YouTubers will record a long video, but then cut it up to include only the funniest parts in the best order. Play around with your videos in a basic editing software like iMovie. Only keep the best bits. Don't record your videos straight to YouTube. Take some time to edit them before making them live on your channel.  Popular YouTube videos are short, clean, and neat. No long intros or credits at the end, no loud soundtrack in the background, no fancy fades or camera tricks. It should just feature the content that you want to highlight.   If you want to share links, put the links in the description box below the video. Link boxes in the video are annoying for lots of users who just want to watch. This might get your other videos more accidental views, when people click on them while trying to delete the boxes, but it won't get you more subscribers.  It's good to have a theme for your channel, but people don't want to watch the exact same video over and over and over. Try to mix it up. Come up with a few different types of features, or a short week-long theme for your channel, to give people a reason to keep watching.   If you do cooking videos, mix up the type of recipes you feature. Aim for a dessert item one week, then an entrée the next. Do a month of only your best Italian dishes. Do a month where you try out recipes you've never tried before. Do a month of dishes your grandmother showed you.  Some popular channels feature videos that are quite long, 15-20 minutes, while other popular channels feature videos that never go past the four minute mark. The video should be long enough to do what you want it to do, and no longer.   If your channel appeals to younger kids, keep the videos short. Humor videos and blogs should be no longer than 3-4 minutes. If your channel appeals to an older, specialized audience, like for beer or cigar reviews, your videos should be more in-depth and longer.  

learn more about your viewers.  use better sound and video equipment.  edit your content well.  keep your videos uncluttered and neat.  make lots of different kinds of videos.  match the length of the video to your topic. 

 Don't just go to the first one you see. Find out how much they pay, when they will be open and how many papers you will have to deliver on a daily basis.; , Sign your name up so even if you don't get one immediately, you'll get one eventually.  If not, your parent or guardian should give their permission if applicable.  Learn the easiest and quickest way around all the homes and businesses you need to deliver to. Ensure you know which street, lanes and roads are where because being lost is one of the worst things that can happen. Ensure you deliver on time because if you're late, you might not get as much pay.  If the houses are all next to each other then don't bother, unless you want to. However it goes quicker with a bike.  If you had to be there at 7:00 a.m. get up at 6:00 to 6:15. Have something to eat before you go. Something like a banana and a glass of water. This gives you enough energy and hydration to keep you going.  If it's cold, wear a warm coat or suitable jacket. This is the most important thing. Make sure it is waterproof. The worst thing that can happen is that you get soaked to the bone or covered in snow.  It will mostly be cold and dark, unless it is between March and September. Put lights on your bike, it's the law, and carry a torch. Keep your bike in full working order and cycle safely.  You may look silly but you'd be bloody terrified going down a busy road when cars don't expect you to be there and they can't see you. It's really not worth the risk. And besides, who's going to know? Put on suitable shoes too. You may have a long walk. If it's icy, try to wear shoes or boots that give you some grip. Remember pavements and drives won't be gritted.  It's dark, often, you are alone, and possibly wandering around isolated farm houses or down unlit driveways. Have a mobile phone with you if possible. Don't accept lifts back home from strangers, or cups of tea from customers you don't know, however cold it is. Make sure that you are usually finished and home around the same time so people know to look for you if you are delayed, if your bike got a puncture for example.  Say good morning. It might help you earn a tip at Christmas.  The papers are heavy with supplements and you'll probably need to take your time and split the round into two bags. That only really matters if you have a seven day round. Week days are the lightest.  

find a shop / newsagents that has a vacancy for a paper boy/girl.  if you don't live near a suitable shop, inquire at your school to see if anyone in the local area runs a paper business.  make sure you get a work permit from your guidance counselor because if you don't, you'll be classed as breaking the law, if you have a guidance counselor.  learn your route like the back of your hand.  if it is a long round consider taking a bike.  get prepared the night before.  be prepared for the weather.  have lights if it's dark.  wear a high visibility jacket or fluorescent arm bands.  try to be safety conscious.  be friendly but not familiar if you meet a homeowner you deliver to.  note that weekend rounds are by far the hardest in the week. 

 Inner pain may occur because something is not going well and you want it to change. Goals can help reduce inner pain and depression.   Think about goals you might have to reduce your inner pain and work toward a positive well-being. This may include something like exercising three times a week or working on your resume to work toward the larger goal of finding a new job. Think of career opportunities, relationship goals, and personal activity goals (such as travel).  When some people experience emotional pain, they develop coping skills to help reduce the negative emotions they feel. If you discuss what you’ve already tried, the other person may be able to help you think of or identify alternative ways of coping with inner pain that you haven’t tried or thought of yet.   Analyze your behaviors with the other person. Do you use ways of coping that are harmful, such as using drugs or alcohol to dull emotional pain? Ask the person to help you come up with alternative coping skills that might be healthier in the long-run such as exercise and deep breathing exercises.  Once you have told the person about your story and your inner pain, you can choose to elicit feedback or advice.   Question if the person has any thoughts or response to what you’ve said. Ask the person what she would do in a similar situation. Ask the person for possible coping strategies. Request that the person teach them to you if you do not know how to do them.  It can a draining process to listen to another person’s pain and help them develop a plan to reduce it. So, make sure that you thank the person for listening to you and helping you. If you do this it will increase the likelihood that she will want to help you in the future because she may feel appreciated.   Say, “Thanks so much for listening,” or, “I really appreciate your help.”  

discuss what you’d like to change.  talk about what you’ve already tried.  ask for feedback.  express gratitude. 

 Hands down, the best way to learn a new language is to speak it. Too often, people spend all of their time studying grammar and memorizing lists of words instead of actually going out there and putting what they've learned into practice. Speaking with a real, live person will help you to feel much more motivated about learning the language than staring at a book or computer screen.   Try to find a friend or colleague who speaks the language you wish to learn and who'd be willing to sit down with you and help you practice. Alternatively, you could try putting ads in local online forums or newspapers to find someone to tutor you or participate in a language exchange. If you can't find anyone who speaks your language nearby, try to connect with someone on Skype. People in foreign countries are often willing to exchange half an hour of speaking in their native tongue for half an hour of speaking in English. A Hellotalk account is another option.; , People often claim to have studied a language "for five years" and still not be fluent. But when they say five years, they probably mean that they studied the language for only a couple of hours a week over that entire time period. Let's get one thing clear -- if you want to learn a new language quickly -- that is, in the space of a few weeks or months -- you're going to have to commit to studying the language for a couple of hours per day.   Language learning is based on repetition -- hammering something into your brain over and over again until you remember it. If you break too long between study sessions, you are much more prone to forget what you learned last time and you will waste valuable study time going back over what you've already learned. You can cut down on this wasted time by studying every day. There are no miraculous short cuts when it comes to language learning -- you just need to commit.  Carrying a dictionary with you will save you a lot of time and frustration, so invest in one as soon as possible!   It can be an actual, physical dictionary, or a dictionary app on your phone -- you just need to be able to consult it quickly whenever you need a word. Carrying a dictionary will allow you to find the necessary word at a moments notice. This is especially important when you are having a conversation with a native speaker and don't wish to disrupt the flow of conversation by not being able to remember a word. In addition, looking up the word and using it immediately in a sentence will help you to commit the word to memory. You can also peruse the dictionary at random moments throughout the day -- when you're waiting in line at the grocery store, when you're on a coffee break at work, or sitting in traffic. You could learn an extra 20 or 30 words a day this way!  , Immersing yourself in a language means doing all of the activities you would normally do in your native tongue, through your new language -- whether that's reading, writing or listening.   Possibly the easiest thing you can do is watch television shows or movies in the language you are trying to learn. Try to avoid subtitles, as you will tend to rely on them. To make things easier, try to watch shows or movies whose plots you are already familiar with -- like kids' cartoons or dubbed versions of English movies -- knowing the context will help you to decipher the meanings of words and phrases. You should also attempt to read and write in your new language. Get a newspaper or magazine and attempt to read one article a day -- looking up any words you don't understand in your dictionary. You should also try to write a few simple things in your new language --whether it's a pretend postcard or a shopping list. Download podcasts or tune in to radio stations in your new language. This is a great way to immerse yourself in the language while you're on the go. Not only does this help with your listening comprehension, it also allows you to hear the correct pronunciation of common words and phrases. Change your language settings on all your electronic devices so that you can pick up words you know already in English but not in the new language. Listen to songs in that language. Try to learn the lyrics, then check what they mean. That way, if you hear it again, you can tell what the conversation is about at that point.  Obviously, it would be a great boost to your language learning skills if you could visit and spend some time in a country where your new language is spoken.   Force yourself to interact with the locals -- whether you're asking for directions, completing a transaction in a store, or simply saying hello -- and you will gain a new appreciation of the language and its speakers. It doesn't matter how basic your oral skills are, keep pushing yourself to speak and you will soon notice a vast improvement in your vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation.  

connect with a native speaker.  study the language every day.  carry a dictionary at all times.  watch, listen, read and write in your chosen language.  visit a country where your chosen language is spoken. 

 Stretching is a good way to strengthen your forearm muscles and release any pain or stress. A constant stretching and strengthening routine can help to alleviate forearm Tendinitis.Your extensor muscles help you extend your wrist and are important for healthy forearm muscles.   Sit in a chair and rest your elbow on a flat table or surface. Straighten your arm out fully. Your wrist should extend beyond the edge of the table. Push the palm of your hand down with your opposite hand. You should feel a stretch across the top of your forearm and bent hand. Hold the stretch for 15 seconds and repeat it two to three times on each arm. You can also do this stretch while standing, or while doing a light jog on a treadmill or in place., These are the muscles that help you flex the wrist.   Sit in a chair with your elbow resting on a table or flat surface. Straighten the arm out fully with your palm facing up. Your wrist should extend beyond the edge of the table. Push your palm downward with your opposite hand to stretch the forearm flexors. Hold the stretch for 15 seconds and repeat it two to three times on each arm. You can also do this stretch while standing, or while doing a light jog on a treadmill or in place., Always do stretching exercises first, before you do any strengthening exercises. Use a .5 lb or 1lb weight to do these exercises. In a pinch, you can also use a soup can or a light weight hammer.   Sit in a chair with your forearm resting on a flat table or surface. Your wrist should extend past the edge of the table. Extend your forearm fully with your palm facing downwards. Grasping a weight in your hand, extend your wrist upward. Hold this position for two seconds and then release slowly. Repeat the exercise 30 to 50 times, twice a day. However, if you feel any pain while doing these exercises, lessen the amount of times you do them in a day.  Use a .5lb or 1lb weight to do this exercise.   Sit in a chair with your forearm resting on a flat table or surface. Your wrist should extend beyond the edge of the table. Extend your arm fully with your palm facing up. Grasping the weight in your hand, flex your wrist upwards. Hold this position for two seconds, then slowly release. Repeat the exercise 30 to 50 times, twice a day. However, if you feel any pain while doing these exercises, lessen the amount of times you do them in a day.  These are the muscles that help you move your wrist from side to side. Use a .5lb or 1b weight for this exercise.   Hold the weight in your hand with the thumb facing up. Move your wrist up and down, much like hammering a nail. All the motion should occur at your wrist joint, not at the elbow or shoulder joint. Repeat the exercise 30 to 50 times, twice a day. Lessen the number of reps if you feel any pain.  These are the muscles that allow you to turn your hand over.   Hold a .5 lb or 1 lb weight in your hand with your thumb pointing up. Turn your wrist inward as far as possible and hold for two seconds. Turn your wrist outward as far as possible and hold for two seconds. Repeat up to 50 repetitions. Lessen the number of reps if you feel any pain.  

stretch the extensor muscles of your forearm.  do a forearm flexor stretch.  strengthen your forearm extensor muscles.  strengthen your forearm flexors.  do deviator muscle exercises.  exercise your pronator and supinator muscles. 

 You may be passionate about obtaining an advanced degree, starting a family, creating a successful business or writing a book. Begin visualizing these goals and talk to competent people about how you might achieve your aspirations. Ask yourself what really makes you happy and try to follow your happiness., It is a bad idea to follow a life trajectory just because someone tells you to. However, other people will be able to recognize your strengths in an unbiased way that you often cannot. Listen to what they say about your strengths and weaknesses. Try to tailor your goals to your strengths.For example, if you are good at drawing, consider careers in visual design. If you are good at writing, think about how you can leverage that in your own career. That doesn't necessarily mean that you should commit yourself to being a novelist or an artist, which can be difficult careers. But you should consider other careers that utilize these skills, like advertising, architecture, interior design, or law.  For example, you might have an innovative business concept, but not enough capital to get it off the ground. It is impractical to get into sports or some professional careers past a certain age. Talk to people who have followed the route you are entertaining to determine if it is viable option for you.  To get a sense for what you will need to do to accomplish your goal, you should talk to someone who has already accomplished it. Ask her what steps she had to take to reach her goals. Try to get a sense for the “price” she paid, in terms of how many hours she committed daily to work. Build a plan to follow in her footsteps.   Part of this will consist of setting up a daily schedule. If she committed 3 hours a day to work, ask how can you do the same. Will you need to cut out Television from your schedule or severely limit it to a certain amount of time per day? You will only know if you do the math., Your goals will be more actionable if you create a plan to realize them. Create a timeline for each goal and identify the steps necessary to realizing each of them. Put it in writing and be as specific as possible about dates, small steps, and verifiable benchmarks for success.Determine the steps necessary to achieve each life goal. For example, to get into a reputable law school, you must first complete an undergraduate degree with a high grade point average. Then, you'll need a high score on the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT). You'll then apply to a list of carefully selected reputable law schools. Break down each large goal into smaller steps. For example, applying to reputable law schools will require that you submit reference letters, write a personal statement, and detail any experience in a law office. Identifying these smaller steps early on helps you be proactive in establishing relationships with professors who can write you letters of recommendation before you graduate. Similarly, you can begin planning to find a part-time summer job in a law office during your undergraduate years. Create a plan for addressing obstacles and personal challenges. For example, if your goal is to marry and have a family, but you can't find a romantic partner because you struggle with shyness, you might ask friends to introduce you to people, push yourself to attend social activities, or consult with a relationship counselor.  Once you have an action plan, you should reward yourself every time that you meet a goal. If it a small goal, go out for a dinner or a drink, perhaps take some extra time off. If it is a big goal, Take a long vacation. Rewarding yourself will keep you motivated, though you need to make sure that you have set clear benchmarks, like a specific percent increase in sales or a certain grade on the LSAT. Otherwise, you might not force yourself to a very high standard.Reflect on your personal needs. In addition to the physical needs of staying fed, sheltered and healthy, consider your mental, emotional and spiritual needs as you work to achieve something in life. The need to feel respected, mentally stimulated, challenged and loved are important factors for sustaining motivation. Remain constantly aware of the outcomes of your work. Verify that your goals foster your motivation. For example, the chances of building a loving family are much greater if you choose a life partner who makes you feel loved and respected, and encourages you to pursue your life goals.  Constantly assess whether you are meeting your goals. If not, determine whether or not you have committed yourself sufficiently, and, if not, make more time in your schedule to meet these goals. If you are working hard to no effect, consider whether a different strategy would work better, or if you need to think about a new goal., One of the strongest predictors of how successful a person is whether one can delay gratification for bigger rewards in the future. Take a bad habit that consumes time or sacrifices your health—like eating junk food or watching TV—and practice putting it off for as long as you can stand.   This was proven in the classic marshmallow experiment, where children were promised two marshmallows if they could hold themselves back from eating a single marshmallow for fifteen minutes. Those who delayed the gratification to receive two marshmallows went on to have higher SAT scores, better health, and a lower risk of substance abuse. Follow up studies demonstrated that if children reliably received rewards when they delayed gratification, they would be better able to do so., Along similar lines, it is important to practice perseverance. Stop thinking about life as a sprint, instead think of it as a marathon. Don’t expect to reach your goal in a short period of intense effort. Stay active and working to your goals all the time as consistently as possible.Seinfeld, for example, argues that the key to his success was to sit down and write some jokes every day. It wasn’t about periods of intense, highly motivated activity, but rather a devoted, consistent habit.Some people recommend finishing up your most important or difficult task at the very beginning of the day. If you do that, you will have momentum and your difficult tasks won’t intimidate you into procrastination., Research shows that nowadays the most successful people are those who combine skill with social graces. Social skills have become increasingly important in the modern world.They can best be cultivated through continuous practice.   Practice socializing, even if it just saying “hello” or “thank you” to someone you meet in public. Watch how people who are popular act to determine what they do that attracts other people. Similarly, watch how people respond to you to see what does and does not work., Studies show that the confidence that you project about yourself is as important as your actual qualifications.Think about your accomplishments. Practice body language that exudes confidence. Once you develop the confidence to act and be successful, your confidence will naturally snowball with your accomplishments.To exude confidence, stand up straight with your shoulders back and chest out. Project your voice to sound strong. Make eye contact when you talk to someone.Exercise to look and feel strong., Many people feel that embracing change violates our authentic self. The most successful people, however, are those that do not perceive themselves as fixed, but rather as growing, changing to improve their skills, and adapt to the world around them.Model yourself after successful people and follow their example.   While authenticity can be a powerful asset, you shouldn’t allow yourself to be held back by your inability to change. Instead embrace an evolving sense of authenticity: the idea that the authentic you is someone you are becoming, not someone you were. 

clarify your life goals.  recognize your strengths.  identify obstacles that may interfere with your goal.  talk to someone who is successful.  create a goal achievement action plan.  stay motivated.  assess your progress.  learn to delay gratification.  cultivate grit.  work on your social skills.  have confidence.  embrace change.

 Everyone feels great about themselves sometimes and not so great about themselves at other times. Some research indicates that people with bipolar disorder may experience greater fluctuations in self-esteem than other people do.While you want to do things to boost your self-esteem and maintain your self-confidence, you also want to make sure you aren’t going too far.   Keep a list of your positive qualities in a journal. Think about things you are good at, coping strategies you’ve developed, personality traits, and more. Add to it and review it frequently. If your entries seem a bit outrageous (for example, if you write “I’m the best pianist ever”) it may be signs of a manic episode.  When you are managing bipolar disorder you may find that you put yourself down or think negative things about yourself. This may lead to a cycle of negativity. Instead, keep a positive focus by thinking encouraging thoughts and talking kindly to yourself.   For example, instead of saying to yourself, “I’m so weird for having bipolar disorder” you might think, “My bipolar gives me a unique perspective on life.” Or, for instance, you might say to yourself, “Having bipolar disorder makes me more compassionate” instead of thinking, “bipolar disorder makes me too emotional.”  , When you have bipolar disorder it may seem that it is taking over your life. You may feel like all you do is take medication, go to meetings, attend therapy, etc. One way that you can maintain a positive outlook is to focus on other things in life as well.Focus on the small things that make you smile as well as the large ones.   For example, instead of focusing on whether people at the party you’re attending can tell you have bipolar disorder, focus on enjoying yourself. Or, for instance, focus on seeing the beauty in your community as you walk to school rather than focusing on how your bipolar impacts your life. Start scheduling your calendar with things and activities that are important to you and that you will look forward to. For instance, schedule some trips for yourself and/or your family, such as holiday trips, birthday outings, or other special events. Not only will you feel the excitement of anticipation while counting the days to your special events and trips, but using your calendar will also help you to prioritize and organize your work and self-care time so you don’t neglect yourself.  Even people that aren’t battling bipolar disorder may attend therapy to help them develop and maintain a positive focus. If therapy isn’t already a part of your treatment plan, then consider trying it. Therapy can help you handle other life issues, provide you with additional coping strategies, and help you manage your bipolar disorder.   Ask your healthcare or mental health professional which form of therapy might work best for you. You might say, “I really want to focus on remaining positive. Is there a type of therapy that can help me?” If you are already attending therapy, ask your therapist if you can work on maintaining a positive focus. For instance, you could say, “Could we address ways for me to stay positive?”  

stabilize your self-esteem.  use positive self-talk.  focus on other things.  consider therapy. 

 Depending upon the type of trim you have, you might be able to remove it with a hammer and screwdriver. Set the trim aside to reinstall after the slate tile is finished.; , Be sure to remove all the tacks and nails that stick out of the subflooring.  If you have a cement floor, use a leveling compound to improve the surface. If you have a wood floor, secure loose boards so that they will not squeak.If your wood subfloor is thinner than one and one-fourth-inch (0.6-cm), install a second layer of five-eighths-inch (1.6-cm) plywood or cement board to ensure the slate has a stable foundation. Screw these sheets into the subfloor every eight inches (20.3 cm).  A cement floor can be cleaned with tri-sodium phosphate (TSP). A wooden floor can be vacuumed extensively.  Paint an anti-fracture membrane onto cement subfloor. You can paint or roll it on., Write down the length and width of the tile. , You can find a construction calculator easily online.  Ask how long shipment will take so that you can schedule a day to install it. In 2014, estimates for slate flooring for a 100 square foot (30.5 m) area were between $250 and $400.   Without labor, other materials and equipment rentals can result in a cost of $400 to $850 per 100 square foot room.You may want to order five percent more tile in case of breakage.  If you want very fine grout line, you can place your tiles side by side.  You will need a trowel with quarter-inch (0.6-cm) notches.  Reorder tile before you start your project, so that you can ensure you have enough tile to complete the flooring.  Some tiles are thicker than others and surrounding tiles will need to be built up with adhesive to ensure a flat surface.  Since slate tiles can vary slightly in size, it is important to do a dry run with your tiles so you know where to adjust the surface level and position of your tiles.  Draw an “x” through the room with chalk. When the lines cross they will create a 90-degree angle on which you can check for even spacing.  Use tile spacers during the dry run to ensure you have even spacing.  If you do, you will want to reposition your layout, so that cut tiles of even width can be laid at either end. This will result in a symmetrical floor.  Measure the tile to account for a one-eighth-inch (0.3-cm) grout space along the wall. You can cut slate tile with a diamond-blade wet saw, grinder or hacksaw with an abrasive blade.  Place a line of chalk on them during your dry run, so that you can make this important change when you lay your mortar.  Start with the section farthest from the door.  You can use slate tile adhesive or thinset (Portland cement) mortar mixed with acrylic. Mix it well and set it nearby.   Consider purchasing a mixing attachment to use with your power drill. It will mix the thinset more thoroughly than hand mixing. , Place a generous amount of mortar down within a section of your chalk line. Smooth it out with the smooth edge of the trowel until it covers the area.  Always groove the thinset in the same direction.  You will move toward the wall. Setting spacers between the tiles at either end of the tile.  This is called “back-buttering.”Use a carpenter’s level to make sure each slate is level.   Press down on the tiles with your hand to ensure it is properly adhered.  Scrape extra mortar from the edges with a margin trowel.  Remove the layout, mortar the area and set the tile. Take your time to create an evenly spaced, level floor. ,, Spread one pint of grout over the tiles.  Hold the float at a 45-degree angle and wipe the grout into the joints over and over until they are adequately covered.  Change the water in your bucket frequently so that you can wipe the tile clean.  Run the tool over all the lines using equal pressure.  Remove dust particles and apply water-based, low-sheen slate sealer with a paintbrush. Apply a second coat after it has dried.   Wait 24 to 48 hours for the sealer to cure. If you don’t want to seal the slate tiles themselves, you can seal the grout with a tile sealant. Paint it on with a one-half inch (1.3-cm) paintbrush.  

remove the baseboard trim around the area you want to cover with slate tile.  remove the carpet, laminate or other flooring that is over the area.  check that your subfloor is level.  clean the floor as well as you can.  paint a coat of polyurethane on top of plywood subfloor to prevent water damage.  research and find the slate tile you want to use.  measure the length and width of each room you want to tile.  ,  use a construction calculator to find out how much tile you will need.  order the tile.  purchase a large bag of quarter-inch (0.6-cm) spacers so that you can keep your slate tile evenly spaced and grouted.  buy your grouting equipment and mortar.  remove all the tiles and check for surface damage before you get started.  sort your tile according to color variation and thickness.  sketch a layout for the color scheme of the slate.  measure lines through the width and length of the room.  lay out your tile to figure out the best use of color.  decide if you will need to cut tile at the edges of the room.  cut tiles to fit around the edges of the room.  mark tiles that require extra thinset on the back to create an even surface.  remove a quarter of the room’s layout so that you can start installing the tile.  choose the mortar you want to use.  ready a bucket of water and a sponge, so that you can remove excess mortar from the tiles when necessary.  ,  apply your thinset or adhesive to a two by three foot (0.6 by 0.9 m) area.  run the grooved edge of the towel in a single direction across the three-foot (0.6-m) area.  place the first tile down on the intersection of your chalk lines.  remember to build up thinner tiles with thicker coatings of mortar.  use your damp sponge to remove thinset that drops onto the tile before it dries.  set nine tiles at a time and then move on to a new section.  leave the finished slate to set for 24 hours before you grout.  ,  remove the spacers tile-by-tile just before you grout your tiles.  ,  purchase sanded grout.  work the grout into the joints using a sponge float.  finish an area and remove excess grout with a damp sponge.  run a grouting tool over the joints to make them more even.  consider sealing your slate after 30 days of curing. 

 Those in a codependent relationship feel an inability to stand alone. Co-dependent people are unable to exist on their own. If you do feel this is the underlying problem, both of you may need to seek professional assistance. Watch out for symptoms of co-dependency so you know when, and if, to seek help.Co-dependent people tend to have low self-esteem, which is why they seek validation from others. If you or the other person is reactionary, this is another sign of co-dependency. As boundaries are blurred in a co-dependent relationship, opinions and feelings are taken very personally. For example, your boyfriend thinks the fact you disagree with him on a political issue is a personal attack. Control is a major issue in co-dependent relationships. If you need to control the other person, or if the other person needs to control you, this is a sign the relationship may be co-dependent.  Space can be positive in a relationship. However, boundaries must be established as a team. The other person may need more or less space than you. Be willing to compromise when it comes to negotiating space.Make sure to listen to what the other person needs as well. Both you and the other person should express yourself in a way that emphasizes personal feeling. Say things like, "This need has nothing to do with you. It's just how I'm made." Try to think of compromise where both people's needs are met to a degree. For example, your boyfriend thinks you should spend six nights a week at his place. You don't want to spend more than three nights a week there. Maybe both of you could accept four nights a week as a compromise. You could also agree to spend more nights at your boyfriend's place, as long as he gives you space while you're there.  You want to make sure you're not accidentally invading someone's space. When navigating a relationship, pay attention to the other person. They may be giving you signals you're missing.Ignoring someone's signals is inconsiderate. Even if you have a need that you want met, pay attention to whether the other person is able to meet that need. You may have to wait a few minutes, or a few hours, before you can get the attention you need. For example, your girlfriend works from home and usually works from 6AM to 2PM. You're trying to chat with her while she's clearly working, and she's giving monosyllabic answers. She's signaling that she's busy. You should back off and give her some space.  

make sure you are not involved in codependent relationship.  be willing to compromise.  tune in to your the other person's signals. 

 Not everyone should get tested for chlamydia, but those at higher risk for the infection should at least once per year. Factors that greatly increase your risk of contracting a chlamydia infection include: having multiple sex partners over the course of a year; not using condoms consistently during sexual encounters; having a history of other sexually transmitted diseases or infections; and being sexually active and younger than 25 years old.Gay and bisexual men have a much greater risk of chlamydia infection compared to heterosexual men.   If you're over 25, consult your doctor for how often you should be screened. Other reasons why you should consider getting tested include: if you have any unusual discomfort or symptoms with your genitalia; if you think a condom ripped during sex; if one of your previous sex partners develops an STI; or if you're planning on getting pregnant.You can get a chlamydia infection by having vaginal, anal or oral sex with someone who is infected. Ejaculation and exchange of semen is not necessary to get infected. Being in a long-term monogamous relationship with a partner who doesn't have an STI and always using latex condoms during sex are the main ways of reducing your risk (in addition to abstinence, of course).; , The early-stages of chlamydia infections rarely cause signs or symptoms, so waiting for them to appear before you get tested is never a good idea. When symptoms do occur, they usually start between 1-3 weeks after the initial exposure to the chlamydia bacteria.The main signs and symptoms associated with chlamydia include: painful urination, lower abdominal cramps, inflamed mucous membranes within the genitalia, smelly discharge from the vagina/penis, pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding and testicular pain. Not all symptoms occur together or at all. For men, too, you can experience, mucoid or watery urethral discharge and painful urination.   When signs and symptoms do occur, they're often mild and fade away quickly, which makes it easy to overlook them. Even if you have no symptoms, you can still pass the infection on to your sex partners. Although quite unusual, a chlamydia bacterial infection can also cause a low-grade fever.  There are numerous health complications associated with a chlamydia infection, which is why it's important to get tested and treated right away if you test positive. The most serious complication for women is pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which causes pain and scarring in the uterus, ovaries and Fallopian tubes.Severe PID can lead to infertility due to scarring and obstruction within the Fallopian tubes. For men, the most serious complications are painful infections within the scrotum (epididymitis) and prostate gland (prostatitis). Chlamydia can't make men infertile, only women.   People with chlamydia infections are more likely to get other STIs, such as gonorrhea and HIV. Chlamydia infections in both genders increases the risk of Reiter's syndrome, an inflammatory disease that leads to arthritis and swelling in the eyes and urethra. Pregnant women with chlamydia can pass the infection to their babies during the birth process, which can lead to pneumonia and/or serious eye infections in newborns.If you have chlamydia, your future pregnancies are at a higher risk for being ectopic (a dangerous condition where the fetus implants outside the uterus). A chlamydia infection during pregnancy also makes prematurity more likely. There is also an uncommon condition called Fitzhugh-Curtis Syndrome, where PID evolves into an inflammation of the liver.  If you are at higher risk for chlamydia or experience symptoms, then schedule an appointment with your doctor or gynecologist. Your doctor will give you an exam and take urine / blood tests to see if you have an infection. Remember that the main symptoms of chlamydia (pain with urination, vaginal / penile discharge) are not specific to chlamydia — virtually all STIs and urinary tract infections cause similar symptoms. The correct diagnosis is important because different infections require different treatments (different antibiotic or anti-viral medications).   Many medical organizations recommend chlamydia screening for sexually active women younger that 25 years because the infection is often without symptoms.Testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea is usually done simultaneously as the two infections cause very similar symptoms.Women should not douche or use vaginal medicines for 24 hours prior to having a chlamydia test. Try not to urinate for about 2 hours prior to having urine collected for chlamydia testing. Taking antibiotics prior to chlamydia testing may affect the results (hide a positive test).  The NAAT is the preferred test for chlamydia because it's more sensitive and specific than other tests, can be performed on urine samples from both genders.The NAAT is sensitive to the genetic material (DNA) of chlamydia bacteria — the test is able to amplify the DNA from a urine sample, so it's very accurate with a low percentage of false-positive results. Results take 1-2 days to come back from the lab in most cases.   Some medical organizations recommend that all victims of sexual assault get NAAT testing for both chlamydia and gonorrhea infections.  An older method of diagnosing STIs is by swabbing the vaginal / penile discharge and sending it to the lab to grow a culture.If a bacterial culture grows, the lab tech looks under the microscope to identify which bacteria it is. Viral infections don't grow cultures, but bacterial infections do. Females get their cervix swabbed (which is at the back of the vagina), whereas men get their urethra swabbed (a thin swab is inserted about an inch into the opening of the penis). Results take between 5-7 days to come back from the lab.   Women can get swabbed for chlamydia during a routine Pap test, which checks for cancerous changes in cells. Some women prefer to swab their own vaginas in privacy, which is fine if they use the same technique the doctor uses — a lubricated speculum is typically needed to spread the vagina open. For men or women who primarily have anal sex, the doctor may swab the anus instead of the genitalia.  

know if you're at risk.  recognize the potential symptoms.  realize the potential complications.  make an appointment with your doctor.  ask your doctor about the nucleic acid amplification test (naat).  think about getting swabbed also. 

 Place your steak on a large plate and use paper towels to pat a one pound sirloin steak dry on both sides. Use a meat cleaver to pound the steak so it's a little thinner and more tender. You could also take a sharp knife and carefully poke the surface off the steak to tenderize it. Spread 1 teaspoon of olive oil evenly over the steak.         While you can leave your steak out to come to room temperature before cooking, doing so doesn't actually improve browning or the flavor of the steak.; , Drizzle the steak with 2 teaspoons of soy sauce and 2 teaspoons of red wine vinegar. Sprinkle freshly ground salt and pepper to taste, 1         You can also add a little bit of liquid smoke if you want a really rich, smoky flavor for the steak.  Turn the steak over so that the other side of the steak gets a little of the seasoning. Add another teaspoon of olive oil and spread it over the steak. Sprinkle more salt and another 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder over the steak.          You can use your hands to flip the steak or you can use tongs to pick up and flip the steak over.  Take one large baked potato that's cool. Carefully cut the potato in half using a sharp knife. Slice one half of the potato into 1         Save the other half of the potato for another use or consider doubling this recipe and making more fried potatoes to serve.  Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon of lemon pepper, and freshly chopped parsley over the potatoes. Toss the potatoes so they're evenly seasoned.          You could also season the potatoes with dried thyme, rosemary, or herbes de provence.  Cut a red onion in half. Take one half of the red onion and carefully slice it into strips using a sharp knife. You can leave the red onion sliced or continue to cut it into chunks.         Save the other half of the onion for another use.  Turn on a gas grill to high heat or prepare a charcoal grill so the coals are hot. Set a 12 inch cast-iron skillet on the grate and add 2 tablespoons of coconut oil in the bottom of the skillet. Let the pan and oil heat up for a few minutes.You could also use canola oil if you don't want to use coconut oil. Avoid using olive oil or butter since these have low smoke points and will burn.  Add the seasoned potatoes and chopped onions to your hot cast-iron skillet. Stir the potatoes quickly so they're evenly coated in the coconut oil. Let them cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until they're as browned as you'd like them. Remove the potatoes and onions to a pan.         If you want crispy potatoes, avoid stirring them often since this will prevent a crust from forming. If they start to stick to the pan, add another teaspoon or two of coconut oil.  Add one teaspoon of coconut oil to the empty cast-iron skillet. The skillet should still be hot and placed on the grill. Crack the egg into the skillet. Fry the egg according to how you like it. Breakfast steak goes especially well with an egg cooked over easy.          You could cook several eggs if you plan on serving breakfast steak and eggs for a crowd.  Turn on your grill to high heat if you're using a gas grill. You could also heat a charcoal grill till it's hot. Dump the coals evenly in the center to maintain the heat.   To tell if your charcoal grill is hot enough, hold your hand about 5 inches above the coals. If you can only hold your palm there comfortably for one second, your grill is hot.  Lay the breakfast steak directly on the grill and let it cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Wear oven mitts and use tongs to turn the steak over. Cook the other side of the steak till its as done as you like. For example finish cooking the steak for:         3 to 5 minutes to get medium-rare 5 to 7 minutes to get medium 8 to 10 minutes to get medium-well  , Once the steak is cooked to your liking, use tongs to take it off the grill. Place the steak on a plate or cutting board. Loosely cover the steak with aluminum foil and let it rest for 5 minutes.Resting the steak helps the juices redistribute within the steak. It will also finish cooking.  Carefully slice the steak using a sharp knife. Slice the steak into thin strips against the grain so it's easier to chew. Serve the breakfast steak with a fried egg and potatoes. To season the finished steak, you could serve it with:   Steak sauce Hot sauce Barbecue sauce Salsa  

tenderize and oil your steak.  season the steak.  flip and season the other side of the steak.  cut the potato.  season the potatoes.  slice a red onion.  heat your grill and skillet.  cook the potatoes and onions.  fry the egg.  heat the grill.  grill the breakfast steak.  rest the steak.  serve the breakfast steak. 

 Choose someone that you have some inside jokes with, or someone who likes the same books or bands that you do. Choose someone who you feel good being with. When you have decided to ask someone over to your house, don't think ahead. Thinking ahead can make you nervous about potential outcomes that aren't even a possibility yet. Just remember that even if you are rejected, it's really not as big a deal as it feels at the time.; , This will prevent any awkward last-minute cancellations. It can also be beneficial to avoid times that siblings might be around.  In order to make more concrete plans, wait until you are both talking enthusiastically about something you both want to do, whether it's to watch a new episode of a T.V. show, or try a new recipe.   Make plans as soon as you both agree on an activity that you want to take part in. For example, "There's a new episode of that TV show out on Wednesday. Do you want to hang out at my place and watch it then?” Or, “I have all the ingredients for that recipe. Do you want to make it tomorrow after school?”  , Call your friend and ask them if it was alright with their parents, and if they are still up for coming over. Remind them of what you planned on doing so that they can get excited about the visit.   Don’t text to confirm. Texts are too easy to forget. It can be scary to call someone to make sure that they are coming, so just jump right into it without dragging it out awkwardly. Try saying “Hey, ! I just wanted to see if your parents said it was all right for you to come over tomorrow, so I could get things ready”.  Tidy up your room, and if you want, get out interesting conversation starters or games. If you planned on watching a movie or making a recipe, make sure you have everything that you need. Make sure you provide something simple to eat-- you don't want your friend to leave early because they're hungry.  If you just sit there waiting, you might get nervous. When they arrive, greet them warmly and show them around.   Don’t fall into the trap of trying to think of what the two of you might say. The best conversations happen naturally. Ask your friend questions, either about things you have in common, or things you want to learn more about them. , If you can sense that your friend does not want to talk about something, turn the conversation back to the activity you originally planned, or suggest a new activity.   It is not your job to be funny or interesting. Experts say that the conversations that people find the most interesting are the ones where they are able to talk about their own interests the most. All you have to do is ask your friend about what interests them, and listen carefully, so you can ask follow-up questions.  If your activities don’t work out, suggest something that you usually like to do. If all else fails, take a walk or get food. Don’t let changes ruin the visit.   Remember that some of the best visits are not centered around an activity at all. Activities are really just an excuse to hang out and talk. If the two of you are having a good time without doing the activity, don't rush into doing it. If the conversation ever runs out, the activity will be a good way to break the silence.  Don't expect to be best friends as soon as the visit is over. Just be confident in the fact that you were able to successfully ask someone over, and keep doing it until it becomes second nature.  

establish that you have common ground with the person that you invite over.  ask your parents or guardian before you invite your friend over.  find an opportune moment to ask your friend to hang out.  confirm the visit.  get your house ready for your guest.  do something while you wait for your friend to show up.  don't let a moment of awkwardness ruin the visit.  be flexible and spontaneous.  remember that some friendships take time to grow. 

 The paperclip will act as a weight and keep your string hanging straight down so it doesn't touch the sides. The string should be about 2/3 as long as the glass is deep--it should not be long enough that the weight will touch the bottom of the glass. This will give your crystals plenty of space to grow.Touching or hanging too close to the bottom or sides of the glass could make your crystals smaller or misshapen.          Use a string made from natural fiber, like twine or cotton. Fishing twine or nylon string are too smooth and it will be difficult for the sugar crystals to find crevices to cling to and grow.You can also use a washer or screw to weight the string, or even another piece of rock candy, which may help your crystals grow faster.The pencil should be long enough that it can rest on the top of the glass without falling in. You can also use a butter knife, skewer, or popsicle stick instead. A butter knife or popsicle stick may be more stable, as they can lay flat on top of the glass and won't roll. , The string should hang straight down and never come in contact with the bottom or sides of the glass.Cover the solution with a paper towel. You don't want to seal the glass with something that will keep the air out, like plastic wrap, as evaporation is an essential part of this process.          As the water evaporates, the remaining solution becomes more saturated with sugar, and the water must force the sugar out. The sugar molecules will collect on the string, forming your rock candy crystals.Tape the pencil to the jar to keep it from rolling or moving while your crystals form., For the biggest crystals, look for a cool, dark space, where the water will evaporate slowly, giving the crystals lots of time to grow.If you want to grow crystals quickly, but don't care if they get big, put the glass in a sunny spot so that the water evaporates quickly.Vibrations can negatively affect your crystal growth. Keep your glass off the ground (and away form the vibrations of people walking on the floor) and away from sources of music or noise, like a stereo or television., Don't touch or tap the glass, or you may disturb the crystal growth and even cause some to fall off the string. After a week you should see big, smooth crystals on the string., Snip the paperclip off with scissors.   If the rock candy is stuck to the glass, run some hot water on the bottom of the glass.

 A fencing contractor that has a lot of word-of-mouth advertising is 110% better than one with a $1200 ad in the Yellow Pages. You have no way of knowing if he paid for that ad by ripping someone off or if he produces a quantity of cookie cutter jobs without customer input and customization.; , You want to find out how long this company or contractor has been around, what's his history of complaints (if any), if they are active in the community... etc.. This can help you form a more accurate picture of the contractor's business dealings and how the company has handled complaint resolution.  Portfolios are a source of pride to reputable businesses, the contractor should be more than willing to show you his portfolio along with give you the addresses of a few places with jobs similar to yours'. If the contractor is not forthcoming with the requested information, look harder.  Get the contractor web address (if he has one) so you can review his site. Often times, they have placed additional tools on the site along with their portfolios and references. A little tool I use to check a website for original images in their portfolio is that I right on the background of the page, a drop down menu appears and towards the bottom you will see "View Page Source" or "Get Source Code" If you select view page source it will show you the originating website for any images that may have been copied. Site builder borrow images all the time; nothing really wrong with it if you advise the person you are borrowing from. That changes when you are a contractor trying to pass borrowed images off as your very own work.  

do not always rely on the yellow pages... you have to ask around the community firstly because these are people with first hand experience.  call your local chamber and better business bureaus.  when you find a contractor that you are comfortable with, ask to see their portfolio.  almost all reputable businesses have a web presence now. 

 This measurement will then help to determine the diameter of the hoop you should purchase. The hula hoop, when resting vertically on the ground, should reach somewhere between your waist and mid-chest. This is your base diameter measurement and can be adjusted slightly depending on your size and experience level. For example, most adults will begin with a hula hoop between 40 and 44 inches in diameter. ; , If you are smaller than average you can take 2–4 inches (5.1–10 cm) off of the diameter determined by your height. Similarly, if you are larger than average you should add 2–4 inches (5.1–10 cm) to the diameter determined as a result of the previous step. , If you are an experienced hula hooper you should use a smaller hoop. Similarly if you have a background in dance or are in good shape you can likely start with a slightly smaller hoop. For example, experienced hula hoopers can take 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) off of the diameter size determined by their height. If you are having trouble keeping the hoop up for at least 5-10 seconds then it is likely too small and you should use a larger hoop.  

measure your height from the floor to your belly button.  factor in your body type.  experienced hula hoopers can choose a smaller hoop. 

 You may feel like there's nothing good about you, that you have no redeeming qualities, and that everyone around you is somehow better-looking and more impressive than you are. Well, all of that has to go out the window if you're determined to change! Make a list of all of the things you're good at, from being a good listener to having a great singing voice. These qualities may not mean much to you, but you have to think about the fact that you do have plenty of things to be proud of.   If you really like the list idea, then you can even keep the list handy. Add to it whenever you think, "Oh, right, there's something else I'm good at..." When you're feeling low or like you're not worth much, read it over and you'll feel better. Talk to a close friend about it. Ask your friend what he or she thinks your strengths are. Your friend may come up with something that you never even considered because it was right before your eyes!; , Of course, optimism, like Rome, cannot be built in a day, but that doesn't mean it's not worth it to start building a foundation of positive thinking and an expectation for the best. Optimism and confidence often go hand in hand, because people who are hopeful for the future and expect good things to happen tend to think that good things will happen to them if they go out into the world or just try hard enough.Practice monitoring your thoughts to see how many of them are negative, and work to counteract every negative thought with at least three positive ones. With enough hard work, you'll soon be able to see the world in a more favorable light.   The next time you're with your friends, practice talking about the exciting things in your life or the things you have to look forward to, and you'll see that people will respond better to you, and that you'll find yourself in a better mood.  Being prepared for any situation -- within reason -- can also help you be self-confident.If you're walking into a math test, you better have put in the hours of studying necessary to succeed. If you're giving a presentation in front of class, you should have practiced until you got it down cold. If you're going to a party, you should learn as much as you can about it, such as who will be there, when it starts, and other details, so you feel like there are less X factors when you walk into the room. While it's impossible to be 100% prepared for any situation -- which is part of the fun and mystery of life -- it can certainly help to feel like you have a sense of what you signed up for.   If you're in a group setting and feel like you have something to contribute, then you'll feel more self-confident than if you just hang back, listening to everyone else's opinions. You don't have to chatter constantly to build your confidence, but you should talk often enough that you feel like you have many worthwhile things to say. You can cultivate things to contribute by reading interesting articles, watching the news, or doing research about current events or things that interest you. Bring up a topic that you have researched in a conversation and see where it goes. Having information to back what you say will help you feel more confident in a conversation. If you know something or have a particular skill-- anything from how to build furniture to how to choose the right pair of shoes for prom-- people may turn to you for help. You can build a lot of confidence by helping others and seeing that they have something to gain from you.  You need to focus on yourself and how to reach the goals you want to reach instead of peeking over at your neighbor and wondering why you can't be as attractive/smart/confident as he is. Be kind to yourself and focus on your own dreams and goals, and be proud of yourself for accomplishing them.   Realize that it’s common to idealize the lives of others from what you see.In other words, you don’t see the whole picture of a person’s life from casual interactions. If you begin comparing yourself to someone else, stop and refocus on yourself. Identify ways in which you are successful, happy, or improving your situation. People who lack confidence are constantly questioning themselves and the world around them. Leave less room for doubt by feeling capable of the task that lies ahead of you.  Unfortunately, it may be impossible to get rid of every little thing that is making you feel down about yourself, but you can definitely make an effort to surround yourself with positive people and situations where you feel good about yourself. Here are some things to consider:   If you feel bad about your body or general appearance because you're always flipping through celebrity magazines or watching television, then try to divorce yourself from that culture as much as you can. If you spend time with a friend, family member, or significant other who is always making you feel worthless, then it's time to question your relationship. You can try to make changes to your relationship by using assertive communication to address the way the person makes you feel.If the relationship doesn’t or can’t improve, you may need to make the decision to end or limit your time with the person.If you play a sport that you really hate and feel like you've put in all of the effort you can and still nothing works out, then it may be time to find another club that suits your needs better; this is not to say that you should quit whenever the going gets tough, but that you should learn to recognize when something's just not working for you.  Well, it's time to be brave and venture forth to do something you never expected to do. This could be introducing yourself to a new group of people at a party, signing up for a dance class though you have two left feet, or applying for a job that sounds fantastic but overwhelming. The more you get into the habit of trying new things, the more secure you'll feel, because you'll get the sense that you can handle any curve ball life may throw at you. Here are some other great ways to embrace the unknown:   Start small. Strike up a conversation with someone you see a lot but never talk to, such as the guy who sits next to you in math class or your neighbor. Plan a trip to a new place, even if it's just a city 50 miles (80 km) away from your hometown. Get in the habit of going new places and seeing new things. Try your hand at learning a foreign language. Doing something that feels completely unfamiliar to you is fun and can build your confidence.  Taking (reasonable) risks is related to embracing the unknown and asserting yourself as an individual.If you want to be more self-confident, then you have to not only try new things, but you have to be up for doing something that feels a little bit scary or uncertain to you. Not every risk you take will lead to something great, but it will get you into the habit of putting yourself out there and seeing what happens. Taking risks will make you feel like you aren't confined to the small set of things you already feel comfortable with and that you are capable of anything.   Step out of your comfort zone at least once a day. This could mean talking to your crush -- or even asking him or her out, if you've worked up the courage! If you're unhappy at work but feel afraid to leave, try applying to just one job. Even if nothing comes of it, you'll see that the risk you took wasn't all that scary. Confront your fear, while you're at it. While you don't have to bungee jump if you're afraid of heights, you can take an elevator to the top of a ten-story building and look out a window. You'll see that you really can overcome whatever is holding you back.  Maintaining positive influences can be even more beneficial to building your self-confidence than cutting out negative influences. If you spend a lot of time with people who are supportive and offer stress- and drama- free social support, you will benefit by feeling more confident about yourself and dealing with your emotions more effectively.Make a habit of spending as much time with people who treat you well as you can.   Hanging out with people who are self-confident can also be a big help. Instead of being jealous of those people, study them and ask yourself, "What do they do differently than me, and how can I cultivate a similar manner?" You'll find that the people who are confident aren't necessarily "better" than you in anything -- except having a positive outlook about themselves.  Having something that you’re good at—or better yet, passionate about—can help you feel well-rounded and happier. This can give you a boost in confidence. Having a hobby can stimulate your creativity,which translates to other situations such as the workplace and your social interactions as well. Furthermore, a hobby can help cultivate the social support that is beneficial to your emotional well-being.Be sure that you allow yourself to set aside time for your hobby or activity that makes you happy. This can be difficult for people who have a lot of work or familial commitments, but it is important., Stand up tall; having great posture can go a long way in making you appear and feel more confident.If you slouch all the time, that's sending yourself and the people around you a signal that you're not happy with who you are and want to be smaller than you appear to be. Instead, keep your back straight and your shoulders pulled back with your chest out.   Don't cross your arms over your chest, either. Keep them at your sides or use them to gesture. This will make you look more approachable and to feel more open. Make natural eye contact when you talk to people. If you look people in the eye, that's sending a message that you're comfortable talking to them on an even level, and that you're open to new ideas. Making eye contact with people can also help you keep your head up. Looking down at the ground or at your feet all the time is another thing that can make you both look and feel less confident.You should also walk with strong, confident strides instead of shuffling or dragging your feet. This will help you look and feel more confident as well., If you spend enough time on your appearance to show that you care about yourself, you will see that you'll start to view yourself more positively. If you want to be more self-confident, then you should make sure to practice good hygiene,to shower daily, to comb your hair, and to wear clothes that are clean and free of wrinkles.If you don’t care for your physical appearance, you’re communicating to yourself and others that you do not feel as though you are worth the time it takes to practice self-care.   If you look in the mirror and see a person who is well-groomed, you'll be much more likely to value yourself. Wear clothes that make you feel good about yourself.This likely means clothing that fits you (at your current size) and has a flattering look that fits with your personality. This doesn't mean you should put on a ton of makeup or wear clothes that make you feel like you're being someone else. You should always be yourself -- just a clean, hygienic version of yourself.  But the people who are self-confident do embrace failure and learn from their mistakes instead of giving up on anything that doesn't go their way. The next time you don't do well on a math test, don't get hired after an interview, or get rejected by a date, don't let this discourage you from asking yourself what went wrong and how you can learn from it. Of course, some of the time, you may just be a victim of bad luck, but it's important to feel as in control of every situation as you can so that you can do better the next time.   The mantra, "If at first you don't succeed..." really is true. Think of how boring life would be if you were the best at everything you tried. Instead, look at failure as an opportunity to prove yourself the next time around. The important thing is to learn where you went wrong along with accepting when something was just dumb luck.  Exercise builds endorphins and will physiologically make you feel better about yourself and the world, while also providing your body with valuable benefits. It's a win-win situation, and making a goal of exercising as much as is comfortable for you can help you feel more self-confident.   You can even use exercise as an opportunity to step out of your comfort zone and to try something new. Maybe you've been scared about trying yoga or taking a Zumba class, but once you sign up, you'll find that it wasn't as scary as it sounded.  It's been proven that smiling will not only make you happier, but it will make the people around you react more positively to you.Smiling, even when you feel like it's the last thing you want to do, can also make you feel more confident when you approach people and go about your day. Smiling will also make people feel more able to come up to you, and you could be inviting a new friend or a new opportunity to come your way just by moving your lips. There's no reason not to smile more, no matter how down you're feeling!  , But it does mean that you're the kind of person who can admit when you can't do something on your own. There's a pride and confidence that comes from knowing when you're out of your element, and if you ask for help when it's needed, you'll not only be able to accomplish more, but you'll feel proud of yourself for making the effort to approach someone and asking for guidance.   If you ask people for help, they'll be more likely to ask you for help in return, and you'll see how needed you really are.  Living more in the moment can help you be at-peace with the way things are now. This can help you feel happier and more relaxed, but it can also be a difficult habit to cultivate.Learning to let go of worry for the future and accept what has happened in the past can help you live in the present.Practice yoga or mindful mediation. This can also help you live in the present.  

be proud of your strengths.if you want to be self-confident, then the first thing you have to do is to think about all of the things you already have going for you.  work to be an optimist.  be prepared.  stop comparing yourself to other people.  get rid of as many sources of negativity as you can.  embrace the unknown.if you have trouble with self-confidence, then doing something completely new and different probably doesn't exactly excite you.  take more risks.  spend time with people who make you feel good about yourself.  cultivate a hobby.  show confidence in your body language.  put time into your appearance.  learn from failure.people who are self-confident are not a wild success at everything they try.  exercise more.though exercise alone won't make you feel like a million dollars, getting in the habit of exercising for at least 30 minutes daily, or just a few times a week, can go a long way in making you feel both mentally and physically better about yourself.  smile more.  don't be afraid to ask for help.being self-confident doesn't mean you have to be a jack-of-all trades who is amazing at every little thing he does.  learn to live in the present.if you lack self-confidence, you may find yourself dwelling on actions of the past or worrying about the outcomes of future actions.

 A plumbing snake (also sometimes called a "flexible cleaning tool" or "auger") is a flexible coil of wire that can "snake" through the curves of a drain and get deeper than a wire can. The best snake is a "closet auger" which is designed specifically to clear toilet clogs without damaging or staining the bowl. A plumber would likely use a closet auger., Push down, feeding the snake further into the drain until you feel an obstruction.  The goal is to break up the obstruction into smaller pieces that can move through the pipes. It may take a few minutes of maneuvering to clear the obstruction. Once the water drains, flush to toilet to see whether it drains as quickly as normal.  It may become necessary to remove the toilet and run the snake through in the opposite direction. This is especially true with hard obstructions that may have been flushed by a curious child. If a hard obstruction is known, and you are not comfortable removing and replacing the toilet, contact a plumber.  

purchase or borrow a plumbing snake.  insert one end of the snake into the drain.  twist and push the snake through the obstruction.  snake in reverse.

 If you generally say yes to most requests, you may lose touch with how you actually feel about having someone in your house. If someone shows up at your door and says, “Can I come in?” or, “Can I stay over?” take a moment and tune into your body. If you’re genuinely happy to see them, let them in. However, if you don’t want to get up to open the door, your first reaction is a groan, or you feel knots in your stomach after they ask, it’s clear that the person is not welcome.If you get a “no” answer from your body, tell your friend, “This isn’t a good time. I’m sorry.” Sometimes it can be helpful to talk through how you are feeling with your partner or a trusted friend to get to the bottom of how you really feel.  There may be some situations that excite you and some that deplete you depending on whether you are an introvert or extrovert. Introverts prefer to spend most of their time alone, while extroverts prefer to spend most of their time with other people. If you are not sure which type you are, then you can take the Myers & Briggs test to find out.For example, you may feel excited when an old friend shows up unannounced, yet feel depleted after they stay for more than a few hours. Are there situations that feel good and others that feel bad? Are there certain people you can tolerate and others you cannot? Begin to notice what situations energize you and which ones drain you. This can help you to become clearer on what limits you can set and how you might enforce them.For example, you might like the person who drops in, but hate that they come to unload all of their negativity onto you.  If you’re constantly bending your own needs to accommodate others, you may lose sleep, feel angry or upset, lose money, or overextend yourself. If you know that having someone over will drain you or affect you negatively, say something.You can say, “I’m really stressed and I need some alone time right now” or, “I’m working on a project and I need to concentrate by myself.” If you notoriously neglect your own needs, get into a routine of taking some time for relaxation. Join a yoga class, talk a daily walk, or meditate on a regular basis. This can help you deal with stress and not let things compound over time.If you are an introverted personality type, then it is especially important to regularly schedule in time for isolation and quiet. This will help keep you charged for social interaction.  You might say yes to everything to avoid making others upset, yet this can lead you to feel unhappy or taken advantage of. If you fear someone’s disappointment, remember that a lack of boundaries can lead to long-term resentment or bitterness over time. If something makes you unhappy or resentful, that’s not fair to you. It’s okay to say no, even if the other person doesn’t like it.If someone becomes upset, say, “I understand this isn’t what you expected, but I’m afraid I can’t help you this time. I’m sorry you’re disappointed.”  

check with your body.  notice what energizes and drains you.  prioritize your needs.  tolerate others’ reactions. 

 You can write anything you want, even fanfiction - it's not something that only teenage girls do! Afterwards, post it on social media, such as Tumblr or Wattpad. If writing stories isn't your thing, then write a how-to article and post it on wikiHow!; , Sleepovers aren't just for teenage girls, either! Invite a couple of friends, get loads of junk food, and watch any type of movie you choose. If you have siblings, it may even be a great chance to come up with ideas as to how to prank your brother or sister.  Give yourself a challenge and see if you can pull it off! Here are some ideas for challenges that could liven up your summer.   Say only "Yes" for one day. See if you can jump on a trampoline for an hour. Go for a day without using technology. Avoid complaining for one day.  Find some music that you like and download it so you can listen to it. You can also create "summer playlists" or just a playlist that you can sit back and listen to while lazing around outside.  You can go to somewhere simple, such as a relative's house, or you can go somewhere like a sleep-away camp - or you can visit summer classics, like beaches or amusement parks. Alternatively, if you have a friend who lives far away from you, arrange to spend some time with them. Come up with plans for you two to do together!   If you want to go to a camp, depending on your age, you may not be able to go as a camper. It may be a good idea to ask about going as a camp counselor - you still get to go, but it's also a lot of extra work, so be prepared for what it entails!  , Many people have hidden talents that they don't discover because they don't want to try! However, it can be a fantastic way to pass your summer by discovering or developing a talent for something. Try out some of the ideas below, and as cliché as it is, don't get disappointed if you don't start off amazing - practice is the key!    Draw. Play a sport, such as basketball or hockey at a local ice rink.  Write or copyedit.  Tutor someone. You can be a tutor for anything, such as math, Spanish, science (or physics!), or writing. Try and create inventions without the help of a guide. This will test your knowledge of what you're trying to create.  While it's not a good idea to spend your entire summer glued to your computer or phone, it can definitely be a good way to pass the time. Try playing games, whether they're simple Flash games or a "real" game. You can also browse websites, check on social media, or even just look at random articles on wikiHow!   You can find classic video games online. For example, very old games such as Space Invaders or Pac-Man can be found with a simple Google search. If you have a 3DS and some money on the Nintendo eShop, you can purchase games from the GameBoy or NES era. For example, you can get Pokémon Red, Blue, or Yellow, or you can purchase the original Legend of Zelda game. A non-video game example of something to do online is to research your family tree. While it might sound boring, it can actually be very interesting to learn about your past.  There are plenty of ways to earn money during the summer, especially since many people are going away on trips and may need to have someone take care of things at their homes.   Watch over someone's pets. Mow lawns. Wash cars. Have a garage sale or use a site like eBay to sell things.  Babysit if you have the proper certifications. If you're able to, consider getting a summer job. Many businesses have summer offerings for teens to take. However, make sure you have all prerequisites that you may need; many states require you to get a work permit from your school. Research your state to see whether you need a work permit. Additionally, many jobs will not take students under 16.  You may also be able to do volunteer work, but this doesn't earn you any money. However, it does give you volunteer experience.  While you can't really spend the entire summer vacation sleeping, it's a great idea to get some extra sleep while you have the chance. After all, being in school doesn't really allow for a whole lot of sleep!  , Don't get annoyed by this suggestion - classes aren't just for school! You can learn anything through classes, whether they're at a college or online. Many options are available. Pick a subject that you'd like to learn about and find a class on it.   For example, if you're interested in programming, you can find many classes on it, whether the class is online or in person. You can also learn a language over the summer, whether you studied it in school or not. Spanish and French are commonly taught in high schools, and sometimes even in middle school, but you could also learn German or Italian, or if you want to really challenge yourself, you could try Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, or another language that doesn't use an alphabet that you're used to.  Have you had the same room for two years now? It might be a good idea to give it a little bit of a change! Clean up your room and get rid of anything you don't want in your room anymore, and then consider making the following changes.   Move around your furniture. Replace the furniture entirely. Paint the walls a different color. Put up new posters or pictures. Reorganize your storage spaces. If you don't have storage spaces, get some, so that you don't have loose papers and supplies everywhere.  

write a story.  have a sleepover.  challenge yourself.  download music.  go on a holiday.  discover or work on a talent.  use electronics.  earn some money.  sleep.  take classes.  redecorate your room. 

 Some established and more traditional faiths require a degree in religious studies as well as some form of theological training. Instead of a formal degree, many denominations will require you to complete a series of courses based on their doctrine before you can be ordained. There are also churches and Christian organizations that do not have strict or specific requirements for becoming a pastor/minister in their organization. Choose the path that you wish to take and embark on your journey. You can gain many helpful contacts through fellowship and networking with fellow believers. Most biblical colleges have websites with enrollment information easily available. Take advantage of the resources out there and take that first step whenever you're ready.; , People perform best in vocations that they are passionate about. Becoming a pastor means that you have absolute confidence in your faith and are ready to share it with the world. Becoming a pastor can be a lengthy and strenuous process. Seek spiritual guidance before making your decision. Always ask yourself the hard questions and never settle for complacency. Make sure that you have chosen the right path and dedicate yourself wholeheartedly:  , Be sure to answer every question with diligence and thought.  Why do I want to be a pastor? Do I feel a strong passion for this work? Do I strongly desire to share God’s word? Do I feel love and compassion for all people? Do I feel deep in my heart that God is asking me to enter this vocation?  , Discuss all of the requirements and make sure that you understand everything. Be sure to voice all questions or concerns that you may have.  A pastor is expected to provide more than spiritual leadership; writing and giving sermons is but a small part of a pastor’s job. Find out what is involved. You may be expected to perform some or all of the following:  Oversee church committees, missions and missionaries       Perform baptisms, weddings and funerals       Provide marital, grief and psychological counseling       Plan community outreach activities       Conduct or arrange for Sunday school classes       Conduct or arrange for adult religious instruction       Seek out new members for the congregation       Be available evenings and weekends as needed  , Research colleges that have excellent religious studies programs.Select a concentration in theology that interests you most.  Once you have completed all your formal studies, you will prepare to be ordained, usually by your home congregation. Preparation for your ordination usually involves:  Studying church doctrine       Understanding how doctrinal issues relate to the scriptures       Giving oral responses to an Ordination Council (this can take several hours)        , If the council recommends you for ordination, the church leaders of your congregation have to vote to ordain you. If you win the vote, you will be ordained during a special service in your church.,, Once you have been ordained, you can start looking for a job.   Look for openings posted by your seminary.       Ask your instructors for recommendations.       Contact your ministry headquarters to see if they have a list of job openings.       Search online, In some cases, you may be meeting with a church council or a board of directors. You may also be asked to give a sermon to the flock.  Some congregations get very involved when choosing a new pastor; you may even be asked to have an open question and answer time with the congregation in addition to the church council. If you are approved, you will be “called” (hired) to become the pastor.  Be sure to negotiate all the terms of your employment and living accommodations as well.  

decide what kind of pastor you want to be.  be dedicated.  to ensure that you're making the right choice, ask yourself these questions.  make an appointment with someone in a leadership role at the church you're interested in.  ask a representative of the denomination about the duties and responsibilities that come along with the position.  choose a college.  prepare for ordination.  await the congregational response.  there are also online christian organizations that will ordain you quickly and legally.  ,  apply for a job as a pastor.  arrange interviews with church officials who have responded to your application.  be prepared for scrutiny.  negotiate your salary. 

 Mix together 1  c (240 mL) of chlorine bleach, 1  c (240 mL) of laundry detergent, and 1 US gal (3.8 L) of warm water. This mixture will create a cleaning solution that is strong enough to remove most dirt and stains, but gentle enough to keep from damaging your teak furniture.As always when handling bleach, be careful not to get it on any other materials.  Use a soft plastic brush to apply the bleach solution and gently scrub it into the teak wood. Let the solution sit for approximately 15 minutes and then rinse it off completely with water.   Make sure to do this cleaning outdoors. If you must do it inside, use a drop cloth on the floor to avoid spilling any bleach around your home and damaging something.  Instead of power washing away all of the dirt (along with all of the protective elements), use a handheld scrubbing brush to get a controlled clean for your teak furniture. Gently scrub away any stains or imperfections in the wood. But don’t scrub too hard or you might damage the wood permanently.Getting the teak wood wet first can help the scrubbing process be more effective. And a constant flow of water will help rinse away any dirt or grime as you clean.  This cleaning method is more aggressive in fighting stains and signs of wear. So it may be better suited for teak furniture that has been left outdoors for long periods of time. Simply apply the teak cleaning solution to the furniture and scrub it in with a soft brush. Generally, you should let it remain on the teak for 15 minutes or so before you rinse it off with the hose.Follow the directions for application on the bottle. Look for the active ingredient oxalic acid in any store-bought teak cleaner.  Whether you use store-bought teak cleaner or a bleach cleaning solution, you’ll need to rinse off any remaining residue after you finish cleaning. Use a garden hose to rinse the teak off completely and let it air dry.   If you are cleaning your teak furniture indoors, use a damp cloth to wipe off any remaining cleaner residue.  

make a bleach cleaning solution.  apply the bleach with a brush.  use a brush to scrub.  use store-bought teak cleaner.  rinse off the cleaning solution. 

 To properly set up a circuit to test the resistance of a wire, you will need a breadboard with banana plug connectors, a voltmeter, an ammeter, 5 wires with banana plugs on both ends, a DC power supply, and the wire you are testing.All of these components can be purchased online or at an electronics store.   A breadboard is a piece of plastic with many holes that can be connected together to form circuits.The banana plug connectors make it easier to construct the circuit. Alternatively, you can use two multimeters instead of one voltmeter and one ammeter. Set one multimeter to the voltage setting (positions labeled V) and one multimeter to the ammeter setting (positions labeled A). It’s recommended to get the banana plug wires in five different colors to easily spot errors in the circuit setup (white, black, purple, green, and orange).; , Make sure the power supply and ammeter are off during the construction of the circuit. Using the white banana plug wire, attach one end of the wire to the port of the multimeter that reads 10ADC and plug the other end into the positive terminal of the DC power supply.Make sure the multimeter is set to a position labeled “A”. Use caution setting up the circuit. If the power supply is left on, it can damage your instruments and you could get a small shock while plugging things in.  Using a second wire with banana plugs (black), plug in one end of the wire to the COM port of the multimeter and then insert the other end to the plug connector attached to the breadboard.The ammeter will be connected in series with the rest of the circuit.  Taking a new wire with banana plug ends (purple), insert one end into the VΩ port of the voltmeter. Take the other end and insert it into the top of the black banana plug that connects the ammeter to the breadboard., Next to the black/purple stack insert one end of the wire into one slot of the breadboard and the other end further down on the breadboard.If the wire is insulated (has a plastic coating) make sure to remove enough of the insulation from the ends so that only exposed wire is inserted into the breadboard.  With the green wire, plug one end of the wire into the negative terminal of the power supply and insert the other end of the banana plug wire directly next to the wire that you’re testing.At this stage, the positive terminal of the power supply should be connected to the ammeter and the negative terminal connected to the breadboard next to the experimental wire.  This is the final connection to complete the circuit. With the orange wire plug one end into the COM port of the voltmeter and then insert the other end into the top of the green wire that is connected to the power supply.This configuration is essential to the entire circuit working properly.   The voltmeter is now connected in parallel to the rest of the circuit.  Make sure the ammeter is set to DC. Also set the ammeter to the highest amperage setting (usually 10A) to avoid damaging the equipment.If you don’t see any readings after turning the power supply on, turn it down to the lower amperage setting (usually 400mA).  Make sure the voltmeter is turned to the position labeled V with two lines over it: one dashed and one solid. This indicates DC voltage which is what you are working with.If don’t see any readings try changing the settings from V (volts) to mV (millivolts).  Make sure the power supply is plugged in and turn it on. You should immediately see readings on both the ammeter and the voltmeter. With the circuit set up this way, you can use the readings from both of these meters to calculate the resistance through the wire.Record the readings for current from the ammeter and voltage from the voltmeter. Ensure everything is properly connected and tightly plugged in before turning on the power supply.  Ohm’s law states that I = V/R where “I” is the current flowing through the circuit, “V” is the voltage applied to the circuit, and “R” is the resistance.Resistance is the measure of how difficult it is for electrons to flow through a wire., Because you want to calculate the resistance of the wire, you will need to rearrange the equation to solve for resistance. This yields R = V/I. If you experimentally determine the amount of current and voltage going through the wire, you can calculate the resistance., Using the experimental results you obtained from your circuit, you can calculate the resistance of the wire in question. Plug in the numbers for the current (I) obtained from the ammeter and voltage (V) obtained from the voltmeter from your circuit into the equation.   For example: After setting up your circuit, you found that the current was 10 amps and the voltage was 100 volts. R = V/I = 100/10.  Once you have plugged in the numbers, simply take voltage divided by current to solve for the resistance of the wire.   For example: R = V/I = 100/10 = 10 ohms. The resistance of the wire is 10 ohms.  Tight connections are essential to completing the circuit. If one of the components is loosely connected you might end up with an open circuit, or a place where the electricity cannot continue to flow. Making sure everything is tight ensures a closed circuit.  All of the components of the circuit must be arranged in the proper order or it will not work. You could end up with an incomplete circuit or components in the wrong sequence which can lead to equipment failure.Check each step and make sure you connected everything exactly as it says to do. Draw a circuit diagram to use a map for all of your components and connections.  If the wire you are testing has a plastic coating on it (insulation) this can impede the flow of electrons through the circuit. Any pieces of wire that are plugged into the breadboard need to be free of insulation.Use wire strippers to cut away the insulation from the ends of the wire before inserting into the breadboard.If you’re still having trouble, try trimming more of the insulation off the wire.  This may seem obvious, but checking the power supply is an easy fix if that’s what is wrong. Make sure it is plugged in and that the outlet it is plugged into is working. If it’s plugged in and doesn’t turn on, you might need to replace the power source.  

gather the necessary materials.  connect the ammeter to the positive end of the power supply.  connect the ammeter to the breadboard.  connect the voltmeter to the ammeter.  insert the wire into the breadboard.  connect the negative terminal of the power supply to the breadboard.  connect the voltmeter to the power supply.  turn on the ammeter.  power on the voltmeter.  turn the power supply on.  define ohm’s law.  rearrange ohm’s law to solve for resistance.  plug in experimentally determined figures.  solve for resistance.  ensure all components are tightly connected.  make sure the circuit is arranged correctly.  remove insulation from the ends of the wire.  make sure the power supply is working. 

 If you are cooking or cleaning the house, get your dog to tag along with you. If you are lounging on the couch watching TV, have your dog jump on up and snuggle with you. You can even talk to your dog during these moments as that will help you both to bond too., You can tailor your outdoor experience depending on your dog's breed. A small dog can participate in a hike if carried in an open pack whereas a large dog can probably trot alongside you. Dogs enjoy the outdoors because there are so many new smells and sensations. Paying attention to what your dog finds fascinating will also help you to view the same old path in a new light.Keep safety in mind when venturing outside with your dog. Make sure to apply repellent to your dog's fur if you are hiking somewhere with ticks or other pests. Offer water frequently to your dog and watch out for overheating or dehydration, often signaled by a slight shaking or excessive panting. To keep your dog interested in the outdoors feel free to try out new places. Don't get stuck in a routine that may be boring to you both.  Try to discover what types of play your dog enjoys the most. Some like to play fetch whereas others prefer hide and seek. Be creative and mix up your play time to experiment with new activities. Just be careful that your play does not bring out feelings of aggression within your dog, as tug of war can sometimes do.When you are playing and bonding with your dog, make a point to put your cell phone away. To keep your play sessions fresh you may want to rotate out toys every week or so. There are even subscription services online that, for a fee, will send you fresh toys at set intervals. To find a service like this search online for "pet toy delivery."  , Hit your favorite dog friendly restaurant or café. Go to a festival or public park with your dog in tow. Take a walk in your local pet-friendly outdoor shopping area. Try to incorporate your dog into your regular social activities. You will find that it is much easier than you think.With all of this running around just make sure to offer your dog ample water.  Dogs do well with a schedule, however, it is sometimes useful to mix things up a little. This is especially the case if your dog appears bored. So, do your same routine with a slight variation. Go to a different dog park. Change your walking path. Introduce a new toy. Your dog will then trust you to get them safely through this new experience., You can praise your dog by offering verbal encouragement or even treats. Just keep the positive reinforcement coming. This shows your dog that their good behavior is noticed and that they are an important part of your family. A confident dog is a happy dog. It is easy to offer praise when you first get a pet, but make sure that you keep this up over time too.Offer up positive encouragement for minor actions as well. If your dog waits patiently at the door or doesn’t beg at dinner there is nothing wrong with offering a quick treat. Couple this with a smile and a happy, “Good job!”Remember that treats don’t have to break the bank. Most dogs will be satisfied with a few frozen peas or a small piece of cheese., Your dog is also bound to mess up and when this happens it is your job to stay calm and instruct them in the proper behaviors. When your dog misbehaves it is enough to simply say, “No,” in a firm voice. Do not, under any circumstances, use physical force to correct your dog. 

chill out at home.  take long walks or hikes.  play.  go out on the town.  break from routine.  reward positive behaviors.  offer gentle correction for negative behaviors. 

 Blow dry your hair with a diffuser to pump up the volume, paying extra attention to your roots.In addition to or instead of blow drying, you can tease your roots. Back-comb dry hair in one- to two-inch sections with a fine-toothed comb.Try using volumizer spray on damp hair before blowdrying. Use hairspray with hold on each sectioned of teased hair as you go.; , Use a heat protectant spray first to protect your locks. Straighten your hair with a flattening iron, or crimp it with a crimping iron. Alternately, add large curls to the ends only., Use a pick to create a part, and flip your hair over to one side. Wet a brush or comb with water or styling product. Place the brush at the top middle of your forehead near your hairline. Swoop the brush upwards and towards the side opposite the part. Seal the look with hairspray.Repeat the brush or comb swoop multiple times, if needed, to achieve the look you want before applying hairspray. If desired, repeat the swoop on the hair below the part to the side of your face. Move the brush horizontally to put a bit of wave there. Use your fingers to comb through your locks and flip them to the side throughout the day like Cher from the movie Clueless. If you don’t use a firm hold hairspray, you can even tousle the flip from one side to another!  

add volume to your roots.  choose your texture.  part your hair to one side. 

   If using a gas grill, leave the hood down/closed for about 10 minutes to burn off all excess residue and to get the grills nice and hot. If using charcoal, make a nice pile about the diameter of 75-80% of the total grill space, a couple inches high, and light with a match. Allow the coals to all catch, turn red, and stop emitting flames. Once most coals are glowing red and are silver/gray, you're ready.; ,, A popular way to do it is: Pat the meat dry, season it with salt and pepper, and rub a light coat of olive oil on it. Note: If you drench the meat in oil, you will cause flare-ups, which will cause the meat to unnecessarily burn and carbonize - imparting a very unpleasant flavor - ash. So, keep the coat of oil light. , Try not to use a fork at this punctures the meat and results in loss of juice.  A steak will cook a little after you remove it from the grill or oven, so stop broiling when the steak tests slightly less done than desired.   Use a meat thermometer and insert it into the thickest part of the steak. Thermometer readings should be: 120 °F (49 °C) to 125 °F (52 °C) for rare; 130 °F (54 °C) to 135 °F (57 °C). for medium rare and 140 °F (60 °C) to 145 °F (63 °C) for medium. Or... Press the meat with your finger. Rare meat will be soft and wobbly, medium will have a springy firmness and well done will feel very firm and unyielding. 

turn on your grill or your gas cooker on (either turn on the gas and ignite, or put coals in the bottom and light).  while you are waiting for your grill to heat up, take your pieces of meat and tenderize it using a tenderizing hammer.  ,  season your meat using any type of seasoning that suits your taste.  lay the meat down on the grill and do not move it until grill lines/brown caramelization (specifically called the "maillard reaction") occurs on the entire surface.  ,  turn the meat over using a spatula.  remove the meat when it's almost done to your liking.  finished.  

   Remember that not every market can be bargained at.; , This is a reconnaissance tour, just to see which shop has better items.  Find how much the locals usually pay for the item.   Make sure the stuff is in a good condition and worth paying for.  This is about getting a "yes", then an even better "yes".   Begin with the price that the merchant has set for you. Then, slowly talk down to price to a point that is both acceptable for both you and the merchant. If you don't have any luck, you can ask for something else to be included in the price. For example, if the shoes are 200 Baht, then you can slowly try to convince the merchant for 190, 180, until 150 (if you can) or ask if you pay for the full price but can you also get the extra shoe laces.  This is about getting a "no", then getting a "yes".   Initially, ask for an impossible price. Then, come back with a more reasonable price. For example, say that a hat costs 100 Baht. Begin with the price that the merchant will not accept for sure such as "can it be from 100 to 20?". Then you try "can it be 60?"  , The moment you get the price you like, stop. Don't think if you can go for a little more; some profit has to be made for the business to stay viable. Go home and enjoy your bargained-for item.  

choose a place and a situation.  walk around the market.  know what is going on around the marketplace.  try the foot-in-the-door technique.  try the door-in-the-face technique.  know when to stop haggling. 

 Applying a hand cream to the hands, especially the areas around each nail, may minimize this risk.; , Soak a cotton pad or cotton ball in nail polish remover. Press the cotton onto each nail for 10 seconds, before sliding it off each nail.          Go back over your nails with a new remover-soaked cotton pad or cotton ball to remove any excess nail polish your initial removal missed. Limit the amount of nail polish remover you use. A thick hand cream or oil is recommended before polishing since it moisturizes and rehydrates the nail. After moisturizing, remove the surface oil with isopropyl alcohol. Oils can prevent newly applied nail polish from sticking to the skin.Excessive amounts of acetone can dry out and damage the nail. As a general rule, nail polish remover should be used no more often than once a week. If you use it more than once a month, you should also opt for an acetone-free formula.  Dark nail polishes can stain the nail beneath, thereby distorting the color of the new polish you plan to apply. You can whiten nails with a mixture of hot water, hydrogen peroxide, and baking soda.   Combine 1 Tbsp (15 ml) hydrogen peroxide with 2 Tbsp (30 ml) baking soda in a bowl containing at least 8 oz (250 ml) of warm to hot water. Soak stained nails in this solution for one minute. Alternatively, you could scrub the stains off using whitening toothpaste and an old toothbrush. But be aware these methods of removing stains may weaken the nails. Avoid them if you do not plan to "go bare"; they are not necessary if you are going to polish your nails afterward.  Use a nail file to round away any square or sharp edges. The shape of the nail should roughly match the shape of the cuticle.          Make sure that the nails are completely dry before you file them. Filing wet nails can result in splitting and breakage.Try to file the nails so that they extend just over the edge of the fingertip. , Use an orange stick, rather than a metal pusher, to gently push back the cuticles. In doing so, you can expose more of the nail and prevent nail polish from getting on the skin.          Never cut the cuticles. Cutting a cuticle leaves a gap open in between the nail and the skin, which could result in nail infections or other problems that will affect the appearance and health of the nail., This may keep your finger tips clean but may interfere with the polish if it gets on the nail bed. This is an optional step, but by carefully applying a thin coat of petroleum jelly onto the cuticles surrounding each nail, you can more effectively prevent nail polish from accidentally getting on and sticking to the skin., If you are painting your own nails, paint your dominant hand first, before your non-dominant hand has any polish on it. You will be able to more easily manipulate your dominant hand with wet polish than you can manipulate your non-dominant hand with wet polish.  Base coat can protect the nail, create a smoother manicure, and help the polish to last longer.          Paint the base coat over the entire nail to fill in any ridges. Let the base coat dry before applying polish. A rubberized base coat is one of your best options, even though there are plenty of other options available. Rubberized base coats are thought to help the polish adhere better and last longer, however.  Professional manicurists use a specific procedure when applying polish. This procedure involves drawing a line of polish down the center of the nail, followed by one to side and a final line down the other side.          Place a drop of nail polish at the center of the nail just above the lower cuticle. Slowly push the drop down toward the cuticle using the nail polish brush. Drag the brush up in a straight line to the tip of the nail. Return to the base of the nail and swipe the polish out along one curved side of the nail. Drag it up and toward the tip to cover that entire side. Return to the base of the nail once more and repeat with the remaining side.  Instead of applying a single thick layer of nail polish, apply two or more thin coats of polish to each nail for a smoother, more even look. Wait for the nails to dry in between coats.          Thick coats of nail polish only end up drying on the surface. As a result, the polish lying below the surface remains somewhat moist, causing the color to smudge more easily. You should also avoid shaking the bottle of nail polish before you apply it. Shaking the polish will cause air bubbles to form inside, and those bubbles can get transferred onto the nail as you paint it. Instead, mix the polish by rolling the bottle in between your hands., Once the main color has been applied and left to dry, you can apply any designs or patterns you want using other polishes.   Several ideas are provided in the “Specific Manicure Ideas” section of this article.  If the nail polish gets smudged while you work, you might be able to smooth it out using a little saliva.          This must be done while the nail polish is still somewhat moist and sticky. Lick your fingertip and use it to carefully push the polish back in place. It may not be perfectly smooth afterward, but the smudge will be gone. Saliva reacts with wet polish, allowing you to soften and blend the surface. It will not have the same effect with dry polish, though. Sometimes, a small amount of acetone applied with a fingertip will soften a smudge and allow the next layer to be smoother.  A small eyeshadow brush, small paintbrush, or cotton swab dipped in nail polish remover can be used to remove any nail polish that found its way onto the surrounding skin.          The brush tip must be clean, and it should be as small as possible so that you have better control over the areas it touches.  If you want the color to dry faster, you can speed the drying process up by dipping the nails in ice water or by spraying the nails with cooking spray.          If using ice water to dry nails, let the nails air dry for a few minutes until they no longer feel wet but still feel sticky. At that point, dunk the nails in a bowl of ice water for three minutes. The cold temperature hastens the drying process. For the cooking spray fix, wait until the nails are no longer wet, but still remain sticky. Spray a light coating of vegetable cooking spray onto the nails to set the polish and prevent smudges. Do not try drying the nails by blowing on them or by sitting next to a fan. While this will cause the polish to dry faster, it can also create bubbles in the polish. Note that it will take about twice as long for nail polish to dry during days of high humidity.  Once the color has been applied and dried, you can apply a top coat that will smooth out the overall appearance and prolong the nail color.          Brush the top coat over the top surface of the nail, where the color has been applied. Run the top coat brush along the top edge of each nail, as well. Doing so will seal the "raw edge" of the polish, thereby preventing it from chipping. Many experts recommend doing this for each layer of polish from base coat to top coat. Note that if you apply top coat to the nails before the layer of color beneath it finishes drying, that polish can still move around and create bubbles or ripples in the color., Use a sponge to blend together two different colors of nail polish, creating a gradient from the top of the nail to the bottom.  A French manicure can be easy to do at home. All you need to do is paint the nail one color and paint a strip of another color over the tip.  A nail art flower is a fairly simply shape to create. The petals and center of the flower are drawn as dots.  Sponge on blue and white nail polish to create the appearance of bubbles.  You can blend multiple shades of nail polish into a swirled, marble design by mixing them in water.  Sponge galaxy-inspired hues onto a black base and add glitter for stars.  You can use a brush with a thin tip to write letters on the nail. You can even use this technique to create the wikiHow logo on your nails.  Carefully apply stripes of black nail polish over a white base.  Start with a light green base and add brown, dark green, and black dots to create a camouflage design.  

apply hand cream before removing polish.dark nail polish can result in stains.  use nail polish remover to cleanly remove the polish.  whiten the nails after removing a dark polish.  file the nails down.  clean under the nails with a soft brush.  ,  push back the cuticles.  apply petroleum jelly around the cuticles.  paint your dominant hand first.  apply a base coat.  paint each nail using even strokes.  brush on multiple thin coats of color.  create any desired designs.  smooth smudges.  clean up stray strokes.  dry the nails faster.  apply a top coat.  create an ombre effect.  try a classic french manicure.  draw a flower on the nail.  create a bubble effect.  marbelize the nail polish.  do galaxy nail art.  write on the nails.  draw zebra stripes.  go for a camouflage print. 

 Find a fun type of penmanship (check out dafont.com) and use it! Practice it, writing the whole alphabet in capitals and lowercase. You can also write the sentence, "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", which uses every letter in the English alphabet.   If you want to write a sentimental or sincere note, use your normal handwriting or a more sophisticated or plain penmanship. Practice in your preferred writing utensil. Whether you'll use pencil, marker, pen, Sharpie, etc. you should work on the handwriting with that utensil. Otherwise, it may not appear as you originally thought it would.  There's more differences in writing with marker than with Sharpie than you'd think!  ; , From whatever type of writing utensil you've chosen, pick some nice colors that go together. Being colorful is part of writing a fun note to your friend, especially if your note doesn't want to come across as too serious. Being colorful (and maybe even obnoxious with them) is part of the excitement!   For bright colors, you can use purple, pink, sky blue, lime green, and baby blue. For dark colors, you can use maroon, blue, purple, brown, green, silver, and gold.  Put "Hey!" "Hello!" "Heyyy!" "What's up?" "Hi-hi!", etc. If you're close with the person, you can even give her pet names, with introductions such as "Hey there, Angel!" "How are you, gorgeous?" "Hey babe!" "Hello xoxo" "Hey there, love <3" etc. Have a great greeting that matches your letter.   For a serious note, start with, "How are you?" "Keep your chin up, beautiful" "Guess who cares?" "Guess who loves you?" "It only gets better xoxo" "You fine?" "Hey lovely", etc.  Mention her best features and recognize funny moments. If you have a topic, stay on track. Show your meaning on certain words with cursive, capitals, etc. Let her know you care and enjoy her company. Have fun writing, most importantly!   Don't put down anything you'll regret. Even if they don't notice or care, it'll hurt you.  Write some words big, in all capitals, in cursive, italics, bold, and other things. Put a funny remark on the page, but thinly put a line through it. Add lots of exclamation points or question marks when necessary.  Use quotes or important notes. Be her role model through a letter, in case you ever have to be apart. Remind her that she's special, and somebody important to you who shouldn't blend with the crowd.   If she's not overly-sensitive and you're very close, you might be able to nudge at a small flaw of hers (always recover with a compliment or quote afterward).  End with a quote, an inspiration piece, a saying, a casual remark, a funny joke, or an inside joke. Something that you come up with. Sign the letter, with a final closing such as "love" "sincerely" "yours" "forever" "always" "anytime" etc.   Have a signature. Whether it's your name in cursive or a heart, xoxo, a note in the P.S., etc. End every single note from there on with this signature.  

find the handwriting.  choose some colors.  start off rambunctiously.  write the letter.  put emphasis on certain things.  don't refrain from being inspiring.  have a strong closing. 

 This can be accomplished by getting a sufficient amount of restful sleep, eating a balanced diet and including exercise in your routine at least 3 or 4 times each week. A healthy immune system can help fend off the infections that lead to the development of meningitis, offering the best defense on an ongoing basis.; , Vitamins like A, C, E and D are very helpful in maintaining good health and decreasing the possibility of developing inflammation around the brain and spinal cord. The B family of vitamins supports the immune system as well as the nervous system, making it even harder for meningitis to develop. Don't forget fish oils and other sources of fatty acids that help decrease inflammation in general and serve as food for the immune system.  This is especially true if those individuals tend to sneeze of cough without covering their mouths and noses. If exposure is constant, consider wearing a face mask to protect yourself from the exposure.  Infections can be transmitted via kissing, along with other types of physical contact. Know who you are kissing and that the person is healthy and not likely to pass along harmful germs.  Get into the habit of washing your hands after working in the dirt, using the restroom or playing with pets. Preventing meningitis involves eliminating bacteria and germs that could be transferred from other substances to your skin and eventually find their way into the body.  Use a sanitizing agent to treat work surfaces, kitchen counters and other surfaces that people share to help reduce the chances of picking up some sort of infection that eventually leads to meningitis.  Bacteria is sometimes found in meats that are prepared rare to medium well, increasing the chances of exposure. Learn to enjoy meats that are cooked thoroughly and at a higher temperature for a longer period of time.  Immunization is one of the most effective strategies in preventing meningitis. Different formulas are in common use around the world. Your doctor can advise which vaccination is the best option, given your current state of health.

 You can drink virtually anything with your Tim Tams, so long as the liquid is not too thick. Pudding, for example, would likely be difficult to Tim Tam slam. Research done by Arnott's, the company that created the Tim Tam, indicates some favorite beverages you might want to Tim Tam slam, including...Coffee Port Hot chocolate; , If you do not live in Australia, you may have difficulty finding this delicious treat. While local grocers might not stock Tim Tams, you may be able to find these at an international food store or multicultural market.There are many different varieties to choose from, including Tim Tam fingers and flavored Tim Tams. To accomplish the traditional slam, you'll want the biscuits labeled "Original" on the packaging. You may find that the long, thin version of Tim Tams, Tim Tam Fingers, make an even better straw. You may want to give this a shot once you've experienced the traditional Tim Tam slam with the original biscuit., Open your pack of Tim Tams and remove one from the packaging. You'll want to hold the Tim Tam between your pointer finger and thumb, with your fingers being placed roughly in the middle of the cracker.   You may want to have some napkins or paper towel on hand. The Tim Tam will melt as your beverage passes through it. The melted chocolate will transfer to your fingers easily., You're going to create a straw with your biscuit by nibbling two diagonally opposite corners of the Tim Tam. Be sure you eat enough of the corner that you can see the creamy chocolate filling that is between the two crackers.   The creamy middle is the route through which you'll be slurping your drink. If you have not eaten away enough of the malted wafer, it will be difficult for you to draw your beverage up through the Tim Tam., Now that there's an opening at opposite ends of your biscuit, you can dunk one of your nibbled off ends into beverage and begin sucking at the opposite nibbled off end. This should draw the liquid up through the Tim Tam.   Your Tim Tam will also begin to absorb whatever you are drinking. Some beverages will absorb more quickly than others, but eventually your Tim Tam will become saturated. Timing is important at this point in the slam. If you wait too long, your Tim Tam might fall apart into your drink. If you jump the gun, you might find your Tim Tam hasn't reached optimal saturation. You should avoid drinking beverages that are too hot with your Tim Tam. This could result in you burning your mouth! If your drink just came out of the coffee pot, microwave, or off the stove, you may want to wait a few minutes., Once the Tim Tam has become a delicious, gooey mess of chocolate, you should quickly put it in your mouth before it falls apart and you lose it in your drink! You may want to insert your fingers into your mouth along with the biscuit so that you can lick away any residual chocolate.You should always wash your hands before eating, and especially before doing the Tim Tam slam. The melty chocolate can mix easily with dirt or bacteria on your fingers and get in your mouth. 

determine your beverage.  purchase your tim tams.  poise the tim tam for slamming.  create the openings through which you'll slam.  suck your drink through the tim tam.  slam the melty treat into your mouth. 

 If you're working out hard on a regular basis, you deserve a reward from time to time. That doesn't mean you can't try to sneak some extra protein into your cookies, brownies, or pancakes.Replace cocoa powder in baked goods with chocolate-flavored protein powder. A scoop of protein powder is equal to about 1/4 cup of cocoa powder. If you want a really rich chocolate taste, add about 1/2 of the recommended amount of cocoa powder as well as a scoop of chocolate-flavored protein mix. If the recipe does not include cocoa powder, you can typically add a scoop of protein powder without affecting the taste. It may still be a good idea to use half a scoop on a small batch when trying it for the first time. Try adding unflavored protein powder to your baked goods to maintain the flavors that you like while still getting your protein boost., Some people love protein icing, and some people hate it. It doesn't hurt to give it a try, though! Stir protein powder into yogurt or a very small amount of water or milk to create a thick "icing."When you spread it onto muffins or other baked goods, you get the benefit of the protein while masking its taste with your tasty treat!  , Thick foods like oatmeal, pudding, yogurt, or applesauce can mask the taste of protein powder well. They moisten and dissolve the powder on their own, so you don't have to pull out your blender.Just make sure to stir thoroughly to make sure the powder dissolves all the way., Blend one scoop of flavored protein powder, one scoop of vanilla ice cream, and one spoonful peanut butter in your blender. Pour the mixture into some type of mold — an ice cube tray will work fine if you don't have anything fancy on hand. Freeze the mixture for a few hours to allow it to set and harden.This works best with chocolate-flavored protein powder, but strong flavors like cinnamon can work as well.  

add flavored protein powder to sweet treats.  whip up a protein icing for baked goods.  stir protein powder into thick foods.  make protein peanut butter cups. 

 Spray a cupcake tin with non-stick greasing spray or place cupcake cases into each section of the tray.  In a medium-sized bowl, mix the dry ingredient until fully combined., In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar with either a whisk or an electric mixer. Beat until the mixture is light and fluffy. Crack in the eggs and pour the vanilla extract. Beat again., Carefully scrape out the peanut butter and pour the sour cream into the wet ingredients. Beat until the mixture is fluffy and light brown., Add them gradually and blend on a slow speed to avoid flour spills. Mix until there are no more flour streaks., Once completely baked, remove from heat and cool the cupcakes on a wire rack for about 5 minutes before frosting., Use a frosting pipe to frost the peanut butter frosting on each cupcake. Spoon a teaspoon of raspberry jam in the center of the frosting., 

preheat the oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit or 190 degrees celsius.  mix the dry ingredients.  cream the butter and sugar.  add the peanut butter and sour cream.  mix the dry ingredients in with the wet ingredients.  bake the cupcakes for about 10-15 minutes until they rise and are lightly browned.  decorate and frost the cupcakes.serve and enjoy! 

 Series resistance is simply connecting the "out" side of one resistor to the "in" side of another in a circuit. Each additional resistor placed in a circuit adds to the total resistance of that circuit.   The formula for calculating a total of n number of resistors wired in series is: Req = R1 + R2 + .... Rn That is, all the series resistor values are simply added. For example, consider finding the equivalent resistance in the image below  In this example, R1 = 100 Ω and R2 = 300Ω are wired in series. Req = 100 Ω + 300 Ω = 400 Ω

 While it's possible to access your Instagram account from any web browser, the online version of Instagram is actually surprisingly limited in its features. In fact, the only way to "find" people with the browser version of Instagram is to use workarounds that you wouldn't need to bother with on the mobile version. To get started, enter your Instagram login information at Instagram.com., One of the first things you'll notice about the browser version of Instagram is that there is no convenient search bar at the top of the page for finding new users. You have access to your personal feed, but not much else. You can, however, follow new users by finding comments or likes by them that appear in your feed, clicking on their username to view their profile, and finally clicking the "Follow" button under their profile picture.   For example, if you're scrolling through your feed and you see a post by a friend that has a comment from someone you aren't currently following, you can click this person's name to view his or her profile, then, if you'd like, you can follow them by clicking "Follow" on their profile page.  If you know another Instagram user's username, you can also visit their profile page directly by typing its address into the navigation bar at the top of your browser. The format for Instagram profiles is "instagram.com/" — simply replace with the person's actual username. Remember not to include any spaces.   For instance, to get to the profile page of the Instagram user "MikeyP98054," you'd type "instagram.com/mikeyp98054" into your address bar.  Because the browser version of Instagram is so skimpy in terms of features, a few third-party sites have sprung up to make it easier to find other Instagram users online. Usually, these sites allow you to type the user's name into a simple search bar like you would on the mobile version. The site then displays a list of relevant users — once you find the person you're looking for, you can then either follow this person using the third-party site's interface, navigate to his or her page directly with the directions in the step above, or find them on your mobile device.   One good third-party site to start with is Websta.me (formerly Webstagram.) This site allows you to easily search Instagram users with a simple, no-frills search bar. Best of all, you can follow and unfollow users in the app if you supply your Instagram login details. 

log in at instagram.com.  scroll through your feed looking for new names.  navigate directly to instagram.com/.  use a third-party site. 

 Look at pictures of Sir Isaac Newton and study his face carefully.; , If you have natural wavy hair, you're in luck you don't need to use the iron curlers or straighteners. Skip this step.  Skip this step if your hair is naturally brown, gray, or white. This step is optional since there are a few pictures of Isaac Newton with blonde or black hair. If your hair is red, dye it brown, gray or white.  Sir Isaac Newton wore: Egg white blouse- crumbled. Black haired over coat that went down to his shin. Hairy gray pants that went down to the top of his ankle. You must wear something similar to the 1700s fashion. Wear a buttoned coat, get a powdered wig (optional), wear black buckle shoes, a white ruffled shirt, long white stockings up to your knees, and shorts up to your knees.  In the earlier part of his life, Newton was a deeply introverted character and fiercely protective of his privacy. Even in his maturity, having become rich, famous, laden with honors and internationally acclaimed as one of the world's foremost thinkers, he remained deeply insecure, given to fits of depression and outbursts of violent temper. The term “darkness” can be applied to much of Newton's personality. Adjectives that have been used to describe facets of his personality include “remote”, “lonely”, “secretive”, “introverted”, “melancholic”, “humorless”, “puritanical”, “cruel”, “vindictive” and, perhaps worst of all, “unforgiving”.  Don't laugh or smile and don't be mean to others. Draw a line in the middle of your chin for a dimple. Isaac Newton has a dimple on his chin.  Isaac Newton was left handed. 

make your hair like isaac newton by parting your hair to the left side of your head.  then make your hair wavy.  color your your hair brown, gray, or white.  get the right type of clothing.  to be like isaac newton, change your behavior.  to look more like isaac newton, you have to look very serious.  be left handed, or try.  now you will look somewhat similar to this man wearing an isaac newton costume.  

 If you have limited vacation time, this makes a big difference in what you can do in Kerala. Kerala can be broken down into 5 major tourist regions. It's recommended that you spend 2 to 3 days in each region to really experience the area.If you're going for more than a couple of weeks, it may be worth it to try to see some or all of the regions. You'll have to plan how to travel between regions. When planning, make sure to consider travel time. It may take a daylong drive to get from one region to the next. If you're just going to be in Kerala for a short period, you may want to stick to one or two regions for your visit.; , Choose your regions wisely, especially if your time is limited. You want to make sure you get the most out of your vacation. Choose regions that have destinations that match with your personal interests.The Calicut (Kozhikode)/Wayanad region is a good option if you're looking for hills and spice trails. There are also a lot of city tours and nature walks available in the region, as well as tours of caves and waterfalls. Many people come to India to look at temples, and the Cochin/Thrissur/Guruvayoor is home to many temples. If temples are an important destination for your trip, prioritize a trip to this region. However, you can also see many temples in the Cochin/Munnar/Thekkady/Sabarimala region. In addition to temples, this region is known for tea plantations, nature walks, safaris, luxury treatments like spas, and lots of city tours. In the Cochin/Alleppey (Alappuzha)/Kumarakom region, you can also see temples. There are many nature options, such as boat tours, backwaters, and bird sanctuaries. In the Trivandrum region, there is a lot of relaxing spa-type services. It also offers nature walks, boat tours, water sports, and city tours.  As Kerala is such a sprawling state, professional tour services can help you get the most out of your experience. Once you've settled on a region, look into the kind of tour services that are present there. You may even be able to book a few tours for your trip ahead of time. If you have your heart set on touring a spice trail, for example, you can book a tour for your first Monday in Kerala. Make sure you see how long tours last, so you can plan other adventures for the day around that tour.   If you can afford it, see if you can talk to a professional trip adviser. A professional trip planner/adviser may be able to help you manage your time in Kerala by assessing your needs and planning an itinerary accordingly. However, these services can be expensive, and you may be better off planning on your own.  Beaches are a big pull for many people traveling to Kerala. Almost every region in Kerala has at least some beaches. If you're planning on spending some time relaxing at the beach, look into the beach options available in your area.Find a beach near where you're staying. If you're staying in the Trivandrum region, there is a sparkling beach about 50 miles away called Varkala. There is a temple near the beach and it tends to be less crowded. You can find information on other beaches by region on tourist websites and blogs discussing trips to Kerala. Keep in mind you'll need to figure out how you'll get to your chosen beach. In Varkala, for example, you may have to take a train out of the main city to get to the beach. You should look up train routes and take travel time into consideration when planning your beach day. In addition to beaches, many regions have backwaters you can tour. Tourists websites will also list backwaters by region, and allow you to see what guided tours are available. If you're staying in a region known for its backwaters, you should make the effort to tour at least one.  Resorts are another favorite of tourists looking to pamper themselves. If you want to schedule some rest and relaxation into your trip, see what resorts are available in your region and plan a spa or resort trip.Kerala Ayurvedi Centers are located throughout Kerala. They offer a variety of treatments aimed at rejuvenating skin, reducing stress, and removing blemishes like psoriasis. They also offer massages and other forms of pampering. If you want a spa day on your trip, make sure you find a region with a Kerala Ayurvedi Center. Look into cost. Make sure you find a spa within your budget, as prices vary.  Festivals are a large part of the culture of Kerala. If there are any local festivals happening around your stay, you'll want to take time to check them out. This will give you a sense of Kerala's rich culture. Festival calendars by year can be found online, giving you an overview of the type, location, and date of various festivals.Festivals come in a variety of categories. There are some festivals based on an event, like a boat race, while others are religious or traditional in nature. In addition to festivals, there are some ritualistic feasts that occur in Kerala each year. Unless you're planning your trip around a specific festival, you may have to simply accept the festival that falls during your trip. You may feel disappointed if this was not your first choice festival, but keep in mind you'll be getting a unique taste of a given region's culture.  Most regions in Kerala have at least some temples. If you're going to Kerala, touring a temple can give you a real sense of the culture.The temples available to you depend on the region where you're staying. Temples cater to a variety of religious and spiritual beliefs, like Hindi and Jainism. Some temples offer tours, so check the rules regarding the temple in your area. A guided tour can allow you to learn information you would otherwise miss. Keep in mind, some temples have strict operating hours. The Sabarimala Sastha temple, for example, is only open to the public certain days of the year. If you have your heart set on a particular temple, you'll want to make sure that temple's available for viewing during your trip.  If you're in Kerala, you'll want to sample some of the food. You can get a variety of traditional Indian dishes during your stay, so make sure you try a little bit of everything.Dosa Ghee Roast with Kerala Style Sambar has been included on lists of the world's most delicious foods. It's made with fermented rice and lentils, which are roasted until crisp. India is known for its curries. There are a variety of curry dishes in Kerala made from various vegetables and meats.

 You will be fascinated to find that such a large bird as the King Parrot can eat very small seeds from plants such as Baeckia crenatifolia and Crowea Festival to name a few.  When you are preparing new beds or refreshing existing garden beds it is best to try not to import “garden soil” from another property as there is every chance you could be importing trouble. The soil could have been heavily limed or had added fertilizers high in phosphorous – thus making it unsuitable for native plants especially those that belong to the Proteaceae family (Grevilleas and Banksias to name a few). As well, there could be many micro-organism that may have harmful effect on your plants.

 Start by educating yourself about how pregnancy starts. Many studies have found that the better education you have regarding how sex and pregnancy work, the better able you will be to make good decisions regarding sex. You can find lots of high quality information online using sources like Mayo Clinic and Wikipedia.   The short version is that a man produces a substance in his body, called semen, which exits his body through the penis. This substance is deposited in a woman’s vagina (through sex or other means), where it combines with an egg in her uterus to form a baby. Women only have eggs in their uterus sometimes and even then, the egg doesn’t always get what it needs from the semen. This is why you won’t get pregnant every time you have sex.; , There are lots of myths about how you can get pregnant. If you know the truth from the facts, you’ll be much better able to protect yourself. Remember, when it doubt, play it safe. It’s better to wait until you have proper protection than risk getting pregnant because of something you read on Tumblr.   Myth: “You can’t get pregnant if you have sex during your period.” Your body will usually release an egg half-way in between your periods...but loads of women can have an egg release just about any time in their cycle. In fact, this method may be more likely to get some women pregnant, so don’t rely on this to help you. Myth: “You can’t get pregnant if you use the pull-out method.” The pull-out method is when the guy pulls his penis out of the vagina before ejaculating or “cumming” (orgasming and releasing his semen). The problem is that the penis will release fluid before ejaculation that can still get a girl pregnant! Using the pull-out method is very unreliable and for most people, the chances of getting pregnant with this form of “birth control” is about 30%.Myth: “You can’t get pregnant if you use certain positions or have sex in certain places.” It doesn’t matter if you’re having sex in a pool/hot tub or if the girl is on top during sex. If there’s a penis in a vagina, pregnancy can happen. Myth: “You can get pregnant if you do _______ afterwards.” Unless that blank is filled with medication or medical devices like Plan B or an IUD, then this is a total myth. Jumping jacks, douching, showering, peeing, eating certain foods: you name it, these things won’t help keep you from getting pregnant.  We don’t want to sound like that guy at your church, but abstinence really is your best bet at not getting pregnant. Even the most effective forms of birth control only work most of the time. If you want to guarantee that you won’t get pregnant, find other ways of getting sexual release that don’t involve penetration.   Pregnancy isn’t the only risk of sex, either. It’s important to remember that. You also need to be safe and use protection to keep yourself from getting STDs. There are also merits to taking things slow, in your relationship. While sex is fun and feels good, it adds a lot of complication. You might think you’ll have fewer problems once you start having sex but really you’ll have more. This is why, if you can make it work, it’s better to stay abstinent until you’re in a place in your life where you’re better able to deal with those complications.  Full, penetrative sex isn’t the only way to get sexual release. If you don’t have access to birth control or if you just want to be super sure that you don't get pregnant or get anyone else pregnant, try other ways of getting physical that don't lead to babies.   Try something like mutual masturbation. This is where you stimulate yourself in front of your partner or you stimulate each other. As long as no penetration occurs and the man's semen is kept away from the vagina, no pregnancy can occur. This is also relatively safe in terms of protecting you from disease. You can try something like oral or anal sex. This should still be done with a condom, however, because both can still spread disease and infections.  Talk to an adult that you trust about sex, sexual health, relationships, and pregnancy. They should at least be able to give you some advice. They might even be able to help you find resources so that you can better protect yourself from getting pregnant. Schedule some private time to talk with them and then tell them why you want to talk. It might be awkward at first and it might take more than one conversation, but you’ll find that having someone who can help you will make you much more comfortable and happy.   Say something like, “Brian, I’m not comfortable going to mom and dad, but I really want to get intimate with my girlfriend and I’m worried about her getting pregnant. Can you help me choose the right condoms?”  , In lots of states, you can get birth control from doctors and pharmacies without your parents legally needing to be told. If you don’t feel comfortable talking to your family about your situation, make an appointment with an organization like Planned Parenthood. They’ll educate you and get you everything that you need at a price you can afford, so that your parents don’t need to know about what you’re doing.   You can find your local Planned Parenthood clinic by visiting their website. If you live outside the US or in an area not serviced by Planned Parenthood, check with your local health department to get advice about what services might be available to you.  There are lots of reasons that you might want to stay away from drugs and alcohol, but one of the major ones is that both can lead you to make really bad decisions. When you’re drunk or high, your brain doesn’t work as well as normal (that’s why it feels so good). This means that while you might normally make the smart choice and use a condom, your drunk brain doesn’t even consider it.   You also have to worry about what might happen while you’re passed out. When you’ve had so much alcohol or enough drugs to make it so that you can’t move or are passed out, you have no control over what other people do to your body. For example, more than 20% of teen pregnancies were the result of sex that was influenced by alcohol. 

educate yourself about pregnancy.  bust some pregnancy myths.  be abstinent as much as you can.  find other ways to get sexual release.  talk to a trusted adult.  find independent care.  stay away from drugs and alcohol. 

 Depression manifests physically, mentally, and emotionally. Mental health professionals use a system to diagnose depression that includes experiencing a majority of of the following symptoms across environments (home, school, work, social) for 2 or more weeks:Depressed mood for most of the day (feeling sad, down) Feeling hopeless or helpless (nothing you can do will make things better) Loss of pleasure or interest in most activities (things that used to be enjoyable no longer are) Problems concentrating (at home, work, or school; easy tasks are now difficult) Feelings of guilt (feeling like you messed up and can never recover) Feelings of worthlessness (nothing you do seems to matter) Thoughts of death or taking your life; , Although suicidal thoughts are not necessary for a diagnosis of depression, they can be a symptom of the disorder.If you experience thoughts of suicide or wanting to take your life, do not wait. Reach out to a friend or family member for help or seek professional help.   If you are in danger of taking your life, Call Emergency Services. You may go directly to the Emergency Department at your local hospital. Mental health professionals will work with you to create a plan to talk yourself down and also help you find ways to cope with thoughts of suicide. If you have a therapist, let your therapist know you are having thoughts of suicide. Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which is available 24 hours each day, 7 days a week at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). Operators are trained to talk about ways to back down from committing suicide.  Depression results in a number of changes to your body and behavior. When diagnosing depression, mental health professionals look at physical symptoms to help guide diagnosis. Much like emotional/mental symptoms, a diagnosis of depression most often includes experiencing the majority of the following symptoms for 2 or more weeks:Changes in sleeping (excessive sleeping or not sleeping enough) Changes in eating (overeating or loss of appetite) Slowing of motions (feeling like movement takes all of your energy) Loss of energy, fatigue (no energy for daily tasks, not being able to get out of bed)  , Recent stressful events can trigger the onset of depression. Even positive events can trigger depression, such as moving, starting a new job, getting married, or having a baby. Your body and your mind take time to adjust to new experiences, and sometimes recent changes can trigger a depressive episode. If you’ve endured a traumatic event (such as loss of a child or living through a natural disaster), depression can result. Prolonged negative experiences can also lead to depression, such as enduring childhood or adult physical, emotional, or sexual abuse.Substance use can trigger depression, particularly alcoholism. Health problems can also trigger depression, such as receiving a major diagnosis or coping with health difficulties. Just because you’ve experienced a stressful event does not mean you will develop depression. It can trigger a depressive episode, but nothing can force you to experience depression.  If you’ve struggled with symptoms of depression, you may be at higher risk for experiencing depression again. About 50% of people who experience a depressive episode will experience depression again in their lifetime.Examine your previous experiences and note any prolonged periods of time that you experienced symptoms of depression.  Notice any links to depression in your immediate family (brothers, sisters, parents). Then examine your extended family (aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents) and notice any symptoms of depression. Note if anyone in your family has committed suicide or struggled with mental health problems. Depression tends to run in families and has a strong genetic component. If you notice a strong occurrence within your family of depression, it can put you at higher risk.It’s important to realize that every family has links to mental health problems. Just because you have an aunt or parent who struggles with mental health does not mean you will develop a depression or another mental health issue.  You may feel happy and carefree during the summer, but then feel a cloud of sadness during the cold and dark winter. Aptly named SAD can begin to occur when days become shorter and when sunlight is less readily available. Symptoms of SAD can vary, but generally are similar to symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder and differ based on geographical location.Locations that receive very little sunlight for a period of time (such as Alaska, USA) have a higher rate of the population with SAD.   If you experience SAD, take advantage of any sunlight when available. Get up early in the morning and go for a walk, or take a quick lunch break to spend more time outside midday. SAD may be effectively treated with light therapy, but nearly half of those with SAD do not get better with light therapy alone. For more information on light therapy, check out How to Choose a Light Therapy Box.  Teens experience depression in different ways than adults. Teens may appear more irritable, grumpy, or hostile when experiencing depression. Complaints of unexplained aches and pains may also indicate depression in teens.Sudden bursts of anger and increased sensitivity to criticism can also indicate depression. Dropping grades, withdrawal from friends, and alcohol or drug use can also indicate problems with depression in teens., Giving birth is a magical time that leads to creating a family and having a child. For some women, however, the stage after giving birth is anything but jolly and gleeful. The hormonal changes, physical changes, and new role of caring for a newborn can become overwhelming. About 10 to 15% of women experience postpartum depression after birth.For some women, postpartum depression sets in soon after birth, while for others, onset occurs within the first few months, and gradually becoming more pronounced.In addition to symptoms of depression described above, additional signs of postpartum depression include:Lack of interest in your baby Negative feelings toward your baby Worrying about hurting your baby Lack of concern for yourself  , This type of depression is typically less severe than Major Depressive Disorder, yet persists for a longer duration of time. People with persistent depressive disorder typically exhibit depressed mood lasting 2 or more years. Episodes of major depression may occur within the time frame, but depressed mood persists throughout the entire duration of two years., This type of depression occurs when a person experiences severe depression in addition to psychosis. Psychosis can include having false beliefs (such as believing you are the president or a spy), delusions (a distance with accepted reality, such as believing that you are being watched), or having hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that others do not experience).Psychotic depression can be dangerous and can result in death because of the distancing from reality. Seek help immediately by contacting a friend, or calling emergency services.  Bipolar disorder is characterized by cycling mood changes. A person may experience extreme lows (severe depression) and then experience extreme highs (mania). Bipolar disorder drastically shifts an individual’s mood, behavior, and thinking. When experiencing mania, an individual may behave in uncharacteristic ways, such as suddenly quitting a job, making several large purchases, or working on projects for days with barely any sleep. Depressive episodes tend to be severe, such as having an inability to get out of bed, hold a job, or perform basic daily functions.If you experience symptoms of bipolar disorder, seek professional help. It is highly unlikely that symptoms will cease without intervention.

Some studies show that exercise alone can help alleviate symptoms of depression and prevent onset for the future. It can be difficult to motivate yourself to go to the gym or go for a walk-- especially when depression seems to drain all of your energy-- but find some motivation and get some exercise.Exercise can be as simple as walking 20-40 minutes each day. If you have a dog, commit to walking your dog each day for double the happiness boost. If you struggle to find motivation to be active, remind yourself that once you get moving, you will not regret putting in the effort.

 No I do not mean brand, I mean music bands. Scarlet has shirts with underground bands on them like Deathcab for Cutie, The Killers, and All Time Low. A good place to get these cheaply are online or thrift stores, but if you're willing to shell out some cash, you can go to the concerts as well.; , They are cute and interesting and make your T-shirts from being obscene. you might also want to wear them just in case you spontaneously decide to go swimming with a hot popular senior ;).  Remember the only color you wear is in your cami. But don't go overboard or punk e.g. ripping your clothes and pinning them with diaper pins or imitating Pink. Remember Scarlet's outfits are a mix of burlesque and dark wave. Burlesque does not mean slutty, it means sexy and ladylike to a point. Wear lacy camisoles, tight-fitting shirts, and ruffled skirts.  cocktail rings are a must! Make them glittery and loud. Also wear crosses and intricate necklaces around your neck (a fairy pendant gold chain or an unusually braided silver necklace with a cross).  If you want to wear foundation, choose the pale kind since the book mentions that Scarlet is naturally pale. A little bit of eyeshadow is okay, but don't go overboard you are not trying to be Bozo the clown.

 Let your child know how you expect them to behave and contribute while they live with you. Tell them what you expect them to pay for, what household tasks they are responsible for, and what your policies are for guests and curfew.For instance, you might specify that your child can have friends over, but they have to leave before 9 PM. Have this talk as soon as possible, preferably before your child even moves back home. Be sure to emphasize that these rules are not meant to control your child. They are meant to make living together easier and more comfortable while also helping them to move forward with their goals.  Ensure that your house rules are clearly defined by putting them in writing. Talk the agreement over with your child to be sure you’re on the same page.Consider including a time component in your rules. For instance, you might agree to let your child live rent-free for three months, but expect them to find a job during that time and pay rent afterwards. Include consequences for not respecting the house rules. For example, if your child drives your car but doesn’t fill up the gas tank, they might lose their car privileges. Make sure to specify that you can change the rules at any time.  If you don’t want your child drinking or using drugs in your house, make it clear. Decide what you will do if you discover they are using substances behind your back.Alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs often contribute to failure to launch syndrome. These substances can impair motivation and make mental health problems worse.  Your adult child may try to bend the rules or use your sense of guilt against you. Stay firm, and remember that it’s not your job anymore to keep them comfortable and sheltered. You have a right to make the rules in your own house.Giving in sends the message that you don’t really mean what you say. For instance, if you told your child that you won’t pay for their cell phone, don’t give them money when they’re broke one month. Be sure to communicate the rules to other members of the household, such as to your partner, so that everyone is on the same page.  If your adult child becomes abusive or starts engaging in illegal activities, it’s not a good idea to let them live with you. Decide which behaviors you won’t tolerate, and stick to your guns if you feel like your living situation isn’t healthy or safe.If you decide to evict your adult child from your home, then you would need to provide them with a formal eviction notice. You cannot simply call the police and ask to have them removed.  

communicate your expectations.  draw up a plan for household and financial contributions.  be firm in your stance on alcohol and drugs.  avoid backing down if your child tests your boundaries.  consider what circumstances would warrant asking your child to leave. 

 No matter what you do to feel refreshed, nothing does as good a job of this as water. Every cell in your body needs water to function. When you give your body more fluids, you give it more energy. And if you withhold water from your body, it can’t work properly. Water is the key to feeling refreshed.Drink at least eight eight-ounce glasses of water per day, or half a gallon.To remind yourself to drink throughout the day, get a large reusable water bottle to carry around with you. A tall glass of ice cold water is one of the most refreshing things you do on when you’re outside on a hot day. Change up the flavor of your water to make it even more refreshing by adding lemon juice or letting fruit soak in the water to flavor it naturally.  In order to stay refreshed and energized in daily life, it is important for your heart to be functioning properly. Do things like control your portion size and choose foods carefully in order to boost your heart health.Eat fruits and vegetables, placing them into fun recipes if you don’t normally enjoy them. Choose whole grains whenever you have the opportunity. Limit saturated and trans fats whenever possible.  Some foods prevent diseases, from heart disease to diabetes to obesity. You can eat these foods to help your body have more energy, which in turn helps you feel refreshed. A superfood like spinach is a good choice because superfoods are chock-full of nutrients with little carbs or fats.Consider working things like alfalfa sprouts, apples, avocado, and beets into your diet. Alfalfa sprouts are yummy on turkey sandwiches, apples are good all by themselves, avocados are delicious in a guacamole dip, and beets are tasty sliced into a salad or pickled.  Although sugar is fun to eat because it tastes good, it also causes blood sugar spikes that result in loss of energy. A better bet for feeling refreshed is to consume foods that provide sustained energy, like lean proteins and whole grains and fresh fruit.   For example, when you make a choice between cake and melon at a party, go for the melon to truly feel refreshed.  Even though staying away from sugar is better for your health and will provided sustained energy (leading to longer periods of refreshing), it can also be refreshing to eat something that you enjoy, even if it isn’t necessarily healthy. Save treats for leisure times, when you don’t need to use a lot of energy.  Trying something new is always refreshing, even if it’s just a new dish. This is because new things fight boredom and force you to grow. The next time you’re at the grocery store, pick up an item you’ve never seen before, or sample something different off the menu the next time you’re out to eat.Trying new things also expands your capacity to enjoy more, as well as requiring you to be courageous. Realizing you have overcome a restriction in yourself can give you renewed strength, which is precisely what feeling refreshed means. 

stay hydrated.  eat for your heart.  consume foods that prevent diseases.  reduce processed sugar intake.  eat something fun now and then.  try new foods.

 In Chicago style, you provide almost a whole reference page citation as a footnote instead of just using the author’s last name. Click at the end of the sentence where you want to cite your source. Use the author’s first and last name. For example:   “Ashley Hess,”.  Follow the author’s name with a comma and then write out the name of the book that you are citing. Make sure to write the title in italics. For example:   “Ashley Hess, Evaporation”  , Use parenthesis next, and inside the parenthesis, put the place of publication, a colon, the publisher, a comma, and the year of publication. For example:   “Ashley Hess, Evaporation (Sedona, Arizona: Dry Books, 2003),” Follow that with comma.  Finally, add the page number where you found the information: “Ashley Hess, Evaporation (Sedona, Arizona: Dry Books, 2003), 33.”  

use footnotes to cite sources.  include the title of the book.  include parentheses.  finish your citation with the page number. 

 Cave spiders are much smaller than regular spiders, and can fit through any gap a spider can fit through, however, its height is a half block. This makes them much harder to contain and fight on your own terms. Cave spiders can also track you through solid walls, so they are difficult to ambush.  Unlike regular spiders, Cave spiders have a poisonous bite. If you are poisoned, your health will deplete until you only have half of a heart left. You can heal poison by drinking milk, but this can take a while. Try to use your milk between battles.  Cave spiders can hold their breath for 16 seconds, and then die after another 6 seconds. If you can flood or bury the spiders, you should be able to kill them with relative ease.  Cave spiders are only spawned by monster spawners, so destroying the spawner will prevent more spiders from appearing.  Monster generators are often surrounded by lots of cobwebs. These will slow you down but do not affect the cave spiders' movement. Use your sword to break the cobwebs.  

beware of gaps.  heal poison attacks.  suffocate the spiders.  destroy the monster spawner.  beware of cobwebs.

 The vinegar mixture can be quite stinky and gives off an overwhelming odor, especially when used indoors. To avoid an uncomfortable situation, take your fog machine to an outdoor space when you want to clean it. This will be much better for you and anyone else who might be around.Try cleaning the fog machine in your backyard next to an outdoor electrical outlet. If you can’t find a space like this that works, consider cleaning it in your garage with the garage door open.; , Remove the tank from the machine. Unscrew the cap and dump the remaining fog liquid out in the sink. Make sure to empty it completely.   Don’t worry about rinsing the tank out after you dump it. The vinegar solution will work to clean the tank for you.  Using distilled water and distilled white vinegar, make a cleaning solution that is equal parts of each ingredient – half vinegar and half distilled water.   Be sure to use distilled water only, not tap water. Tap water contains minerals that can leave deposits inside your machine that will build up over time and cause problems later.  Put the tank back in the fog machine and pour the mixture of vinegar and distilled water into the opening. It should go into the same tank that is normally filled with fogging fluid.You’ll need to use enough of the mixture to thoroughly clean the machine. The tank should be mostly full. For most fog machines, this is probably about half a liter of the cleaning solution. Turn the machine on and let it run with the vinegar water mixture inside it.  Once you’ve run the vinegar and water mixture, you should pour some distilled water (not mixed with anything) into the fog machine and run it once like this. The water will help flush out any remaining vinegar smell inside the machine and will help clean it out a bit more.Let the machine air dry once you have finished this procedure.  Unplug your machine and allow it to cool down completely. Check the output nozzle (where the fog steam comes out of) for any deposits or debris. If you see something, use your fingernail or another firm object to scrape the opening of the nozzle.Additionally, you can try using a pin (or small needle) to clean out any remaining dirt. Move it in and out of the nozzle hold a few times to remove excess build up.  Use a damp cloth to wipe down the exterior of the fog machine. Be sure to get in all the nooks and crannies of the machine to clean off any dust or residue that may have built up over time.   Performing this kind of regular maintenance should prevent the machine from needing aggressive cleaning as often. It will also help prolong the life of your fog machine.  Once you have finished cleaning the fog machine, you can put some more fogger fluid in it to make sure it is working properly again. Let the machine run and produce fog for at least several minutes before you decide that it’s working the way you want it to.Never store (or stop using) a freshly cleaned fog machine without first running another batch of fogging liquid to make sure it works.  There are quite a few products available online for purchase that are intended for use in cleaning fog machines. Simply purchase the cleaning fluid and run it through your fog machine. Make sure to do the procedure outdoors so you don’t stink up the place with a chemically smell.Remember to always clean your fog machine before you store it.  Your fog machine should come with an owner’s manual that gives specific cleaning instructions. If you do some sort of cleaning routine that isn’t recommended by the manufacturer, it could void your product warranty.If the cleaning techniques don’t work, you may need to contact your manufacturer for a replacement, as long as your machine is still under warranty. So try not to do anything that may void the warranty.  Most fog machines don’t need to be cleaned regularly. In fact, fog machines typically don’t need to be cleaned at all unless you have been putting low quality fog liquid products in your fog machine – these lower quality products can cause the fog machine’s heater to clog.You definitely don’t need to clean your fog machine every year unless it starts exhibiting some symptoms indicating it needs a good cleaning. Cleaning a fog machine too often can cause it to stop working altogether.  The main sign that your fog machine needs to be cleaned is when you start noticing a significant decrease in output of the fog effect. If your machine isn’t producing fog as much as it used to, then it’s probably time for a cleaning.Since you don’t want to clean your fog machine too frequently, you should wait until you see a significant decrease in fog output – not just a small change.  If you use your fogger once a year (like at Halloween) and then put it away in storage for the rest of the year, you should clean the fog machine before you pack it up for storage. Don’t wait until you bring it out the next year because a clogged fog machine that sits unused for months on end will most likely be permanently unusable when you try to use it again.Before you store your fog machine for an extended period of time, check its output to ensure you don’t need to clean it before storing it.  

take the fog machine outside.  empty the tank.  make a mixture of water and vinegar.  pour the vinegar mixture into the fog machine.  rinse with distilled water.  scrape out the nozzle.  wipe down the exterior.  test the fogger fluid.  purchase fog machine cleaner.  follow the manufacturer’s cleaning instructions.  avoid overdoing it.  watch for decreased output.  clean before storing. 

 The most helpful one is the one that has the 'wand' attachment. That is a flexible connector that allows the motor part of the tool to be prone, while you manipulate the more flexible working end of the tool.; ,, It goes without saying that a cat is going to be much harder than a dog (because they have their protective weaponry at hand!).  You might need some help with this part.  Assuming one person is holding the pet, the person trimming the nails starts working on them. The rotary tool is basically sanding them off. If you have waited a long time before trying to do this, it is probably a good idea to clip them off (or have them clipped off). It is more time effective.  You don't want to apply continued pressure from whichever tool you choose to use. You want to almost 'pat' them.  

buy or have a rotary tool.  set it up.  ,  have a safe and comfortable area for you to work on your pet.  hold your pet.  start on the toenails.  keep from burning your pet. 

 A common calculation involving percentages is to find some percent “of” another number. For example, if you are in a restaurant you may want to tip 15% “of” your total bill. When working with percentages, the word “of” carries the same meaning as “times” or “multiply.” Therefore, 15% “of” 100, for example, means the same as 15% x 100.  To calculate the percentage of the whole number, you need to first turn the percentage into a decimal as already described. Then simply multiply.   For example, completing the problem of finding 15% of 100, rewrite the 15% as 0.15. Then just multiply 0.15 x 100, to get the solution of 15.  When you set out to find a percentage of a whole number, your result will be a number and not a percentage. You may begin with a percentage symbol, but when you convert that percentage to a decimal to conduct the multiplication, your answer will no longer have a percentage symbol.   In the example of 15% of 100, the result is the whole number 15.  

perform multiplication to find the percent “of” a number.  convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply.  write your result without a percentage symbol. 

 It's important to learn to defuse a bad situation. But it is equally important to take steps to avoid tough situations altogether. Spend time thinking about changes you can make to stay away from potential fights.Go with your gut feeling. If you are walking home and see a group of kids standing on the corner, you might feel like there would be a problem if you walked by them. Avoid the situation by taking a different route home. It might cost you a few extra minutes to change directions, but it could also help you avoid a fight. The same is true for when you are actually in school. If you see a group of kids that look suspicious, don't engage with them. Use a different route to get to class.  You could get hurt if you get in a fight. That is why it is important to always be conscious of your safety. It's a good idea to be aware of your surroundings.Try to travel with friends. If possible, walk with others in between class. A bully will be less likely to approach you for a fight if you are with other kids. You should also try to sit with friends at lunch. If you are worried about your safety, try to stick close to adults. In the cafeteria, sit at a table close to a lunch room monitor.  You can make it clear that other kids need to respect your personal space. Setting boundaries is a great way to avoid getting in a fight. Establish clear lines that should not be crossed.If someone bumps into you try saying, "I would appreciate it if you could stay further away from me." Speak firmly and politely. Maybe you need to leave the room and someone is blocking your path. You can say, "I would like you to get out of my way, please." By setting boundaries, you are making it clear that you wish to avoid fighting. This is a better choice to make than shoving someone out of your way.  Your words are your most powerful weapon. You can use your voice to help avoid potentially dangerous situations. For example, if you see other kids fighting, you can use words to defuse the situation.Try using logic. Instead of getting physically involved, you can say "You are going to get in trouble if you keep fighting. I know neither of you wants to get suspended from the basketball team." You can also use your words to get help. Tell an adult if there is a fight starting. This is a choice that can help you to stay out of danger. Always try to speak clearly and confidently. You want others to know that you mean what you say. Be respectful. Do not use your words to instigate problems.Instead of mocking someone, try saying, "I know you're better than this. I don't think you really want to fight."  , One of the main reasons that people fight is because they allow emotions to get the best of them. Fights are usually caused by anger, stress, or fear. Learning to control your emotions can help you stay out of fights.There are several things you can do to manage stress. For example, you can concentrate on the positive things in your life. Maybe you are stressed because someone in your family is sick. Instead of focusing on that at school, take a moment to be glad that you get to spend some time with your friends. There are also effective ways to control your anger. For example, you can practice deep breathing techniques. Count to five while you slowly inhale, then count to five as you slowly exhale. Talk about your feelings. If you are coping with some difficult emotions, speak to a friend, parent, or teacher.  All of us have bad days. Sometimes you might feel like snapping at someone, or you might feel like you have an especially short temper. Just remember, you can choose how you handle those days.It's normal to have bad days. But you can try to minimize those occasions by focusing on the positive things in your life. If you find yourself about to say something mean, find something else to think about. Try saying to yourself, "Ok, I'm annoyed now, but I'm really looking forward to playing video games later." Maybe someone said something hurtful to you at school. You can use the same coping tactics for dealing with someone who wants to physically fight you. Take care of yourself physically. Make sure to get enough rest and physical exercise. These will help stabilize your mood and help you avoid the urge to fight.  

trust your instincts.  make safety a priority.  set boundaries.  use your voice.  manage your emotions.  take charge of your life. 

 If it's rectangle, just measure the longest side and the shortest side of the pool. If it's a square, just measure one of the sides of the pool -- all four sides of the square will have the same length. And if your pool is round, just measure the diameter of the pool, which is the longest path that can travel through the center of the circle, from one edge to the other.; , This is the other dimension that is crucial to knowing the volume of your pool. If your pool has the same depth throughout -- most above ground pools are structured this way, for example -- then you'll just have to take one measurement from the top to the bottom of the pool. But if, like most pools, your pool has depth that gradually increases, then you'll have to measure the minimum depth (the shallow end) and the maximum depth (the deep end) of the pool.  

measure the length and width of the pool.  measure the depth of your pool. 

 Review the various degree programs you have located and choose the one that will best help you in the career of your choice. When choosing your degree/career:   Consider your natural talents and abilities. Are there things that you instinctively understand, such as poetry or medical terminology? Do you have any skills or natural abilities that would help you in a certain field? Think about the type of work that you would enjoy. For example, if you don't like being outdoors much, a career studying plants or animals may not be the best choice for you. On the other hand, laboratory work might be just the thing you'd love. Identify degree programs that will help you get the type of work you can be passionate about. If you love to read and value books, for example, a degree in the library field may be the best choice for you.  

decide what degree to get. 

 glasses with cool water and set them on a table in front of you. The second glass is for just in case you finish the first one, if you really need it.  Confidence and positive thinking are important here, so chill out and loosen up.  Just after it hits, begin drinking slowly, steadily and continuously until the glass is empty.  Hopefully you will have interrupted the rhythm of the hiccups, but if not then you will have to go to the second glass and repeat the process.  By the time you've finished, the hiccups should be gone.  

fill two tall 12 oz.  close your eyes and settle yourself.  pick up the first glass and wait for a hiccup.  try not to think about hiccuping as you set the empty glass down.  drink the second glass of water, slow and steadily, and do your best to remain calm and relaxed. 

 Hold the ball so two seams are visible in the front and two visible in the back.The four-seam grip is considered by many pitchers as more effective when throwing a curveball than the two-seam grip. It allows the pitcher to throw the ball at any angle, as long as they hold their hand behind the ball and throw it with a snapping motion.Two-seam grips are used to throw fastballs. Rather than breaking down (as in a curveball), two-seam pitches break to the right or left.; , Place the ball in the palm of your hand and flex your middle and index fingers so they grip the top of the ball.Curve your ring finger so the ball rests against its side., Place your middle finger along the middle seam (on the pinky side) and your thumb on the seam towards the back of the ball., At this point, your thumb should be positioned on the bottom of the ball opposite your middle finger, with these two fingers forming a "C" around the ball.Your grip should be firm, but not too tight. You want your thumb to be able to flick up behind the ball when it is released. Do not choke the ball. Make sure there is a gap between your thumb and index finger, and small space between thumb and ring finger.  When throwing a curveball, extend your wrist back. When you release, "snap" your thumb and middle finger together while flicking your wrist.At this point, your middle finger should rotate downwards and your thumb should rotate upwards to create the centripetal (circular) force needed to spin the ball towards the plate.Through a change-up curveball by increasing grip depth.Experiment with slight variations in grip depth and finger (thumb and middle) position. Find a grip that is comfortable and works with your throwing style.  

use a four-seam grip.  hold up your middle and index finger as if making a peace sign.  position your thumb and middle finger.  separate the tips of your thumb and ring finger.  throw the ball by snapping your thumb and middle finger. 

 James Dean's clothing was simple and practical, as well as being a sign of the times he lived in, reflecting the youth culture. Yet, even in the midst of simplicity, he made a statement with his leather jacket and denim. Indeed, his Lee 101 Riders jeans epitomized the birth of teen culture and denim became synonymous with rebellion.Unlike previous eras in history where lots of clothing reflected social status and attitude, suddenly dressing down became the fashion statement to go for. On the whole, when allowing yourself to be inspired by James Dean's look, keep it simple and unadulterated and know what fits you well above all; after all, James Dean was never about following fads but about forging his own way in a world that needed reminding that conformity was all a bit of a bore. Dean wouldn't have been impressed with anyone who copycatting his look to the nth degree and looking a fool, so don't do any part of what's suggested in these steps unless it works for you.   Remember that Dean's clothing comes from an era where clothes fitted the body closely, following the human form and hugging it. Nothing baggy, loose or tent-like should be used when trying to achieve the James Dean look.; , They should be straight legged and of a classic cut. Most importantly, they should be in excellent condition, with no rips, tears or scruffy hems. The jeans should fit well and not be baggy or loose and definitely not hanging off your backside.   If you want a truly authentic look, add cuffs to the leg ends of the jeans or simply turn them up. If that isn't something you're keen to wear, simply ensure that the ends are neat and not frayed. Most of James Dean's jeans were in the mid to dark blue range, with some wear but still neat. Add a large belt with an obvious belt buckle to complete the look.  Again, staying with simplicity, the more common choices for James Dean included:   White t-shirts: It never hurts to have a number of these in the wardrobe, freshly laundered and pressed, ready for wearing. The white tee is very versatile too – it looks good under jackets (especially the leather kind) and by itself. Muscle cut polo shirts: Obviously, to show off the muscle work and generally look rebellious and cool.  If you like James Dean and want to dress like him, your best source of ideas will be found in his movies. Of course, he had designers working out a lot of these clothes but they evoked a style of an era and Dean wasn't averse to wearing many of the same clothes off the big screen either. Here are some of the things you might discover when watching them:   If you're going for a movie look, Rebel Without a Cause and East of Eden are worth watching as those demonstrate his greatest movie outfits.   Rebel Without a Cause, he sported a red cotton windbreaker jacket, which you can buy on Dean's official website, a white V-neck muscle cut shirt, and worn dark jeans, with very simple black engineer boots.  East of Eden was his "good boy look", he wore a khaki colored v-neck sweater, under it a white or light blue polo shirt, khaki slacks or pants, with brown dress shoes, or gray converse Chuck Taylor's.  The choices here are fairly easy:   Work boots: Some classic black boots, which are plain and unadorned are the ideal choice. Pair these with plain white socks. If there's a heel on them, so much the better. Simple converse shoes or similar for casual wear are fine. Again, pair with very basic, plain socks.  This is probably one of the most remembered iconic pieces of clothing worn by Dean. Like the white t-shirt and denim jeans, it's a simple piece that can be worn with a number of items easily.   When wearing the jacket, have the collar flipped "up" (pop it), if you have to take it off, hang it over your shoulder. As noted earlier, Dean also wore a rebellious red jacket in Rebel without a cause, which gives a bit of variety to your wardrobe.  James Dean sported a pompadour. This was the only style that he ever wore, so if it's one you like, consider adopting it as well. However, it's a good idea to speak with your hairdresser about the practicalities of looking after it and whether or not it will suit your face shape, etc.   The swept back look can be done in varying degrees of severity, so let your hairdresser help you choose what is best for your needs. If you do have a pompadour, always have a comb; when your hair looks good, you'll feel good, and when a sexy girl passes by, comb the side of your hair. Back in the 50's, men told women they were sexy through combing their hair near them, or when they passed by.  For dress clothes, Dean was still very simplistic in his style. When he wore a tuxedo, he wore a white dinner jacket with a slim black tie, black slacks, with black patent leather shoes (very shinny black shoes).   When at a casual dress occasion, he usually sported a wool sports jacket, in the brown or khaki colors, a white or cream colored button down shirt, thin brown belt, khaki pants, and brown dress shoes – never wear square toe shoes, always round. The long overcoat worn in this image was also a Dean trademark. It's a great addition for the colder weather.  Finally, while clothes make you appear interesting, your personality is what really draws people in. Flirting gently, being an all-round pleasant guy and being helpful around women is a Dean-like way to be, while being cool, tough and not sensitive is a Dean-like approach to hanging around with the guys.   Shrug off the rudeness of others. It's not worth your while to chase compliments or confirm people's nastiness by stooping to their level.  Stand up for yourself. Dean didn't like violence; he was tough but not rough. Use your smarts and your wit to maneuver around the violent people you come across and don't be a bully.  

understand the statement james dean made with his clothing.  begin by purchasing or finding basic, classic blue jeans.  choose the t-shirts that james dean would have enjoyed wearing.  check out the movies for more ideas.  choose shoes and boots that reflect james dean's style.  get a black leather jacket.  consider wearing your hair like james dean's.  dress up.  sport the attitude. 

 Write a list of all the things in your life you are blessed in having: shelter, food, clean water, health etc. Include things that bring you pleasure too. Whether it's watching your favourite t.v. show or smelling freshly cut grass. Once you get started on this list, you'll be pleasantly surprised at just how much you have.; , What things have you always wanted to do but are yet to attempt? What can you realistically try? For example, maybe you've always wanted to watch the sunrise or take up a new class. Once you have this list, make the effort to do something on it, maybe one a month, one every six months... Just make sure you try it. Find a combination of things that are free of charge and some that cost. That way, if you're broke, you can try something that won't cost. You'll have no excuse not to.  One fantastic way of appreciating the beauty that's around you is to take the time each day to take one single photograph. The camera doesn't have to be top quality and you don't have to be a great photographer. If you limit yourself to one photograph, you'll really stop and look hard at what's around you.  It's too easy to text or e-mail. Have a conversation every now and then! Hearing their voice, actually seeing them, makes the communication much more satisfying. Appreciating other people who are there for you is key to appreciating life.  

count your blessings.  make a 'to do' list.  photograph memories.  talk to your loved ones.

 Girls who don’t show confidence are taken advantage of. It’s impossible to be passive and be a bad girl. People are attracted to confidence. Bad girls are not afraid to say what they want. They know what they want, and they go for it. Bad girls never ask for compliments. They expect them. , Never beg or call too many times. That doesn’t mean you should be rude. Show manners. If someone texts you, text back. It means you don't always text first, though. Wait a day before calling back when starting out. Understand when people need space.  Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis didn’t talk about her secrets. Neither should you. Never let them see you sweat. In the words of the Duchess of Windsor, “Never complain. Never explain.” The screen goddess Sophia Loren was known for saying, “Sex appeal is fifty percent what you've got and fifty percent what people think you've got.”, You have a circle of friends you trust, but you don’t need them with you at all times. You don’t need a partner to make you happy, either. You’re comfortable with yourself, and you know who you are.   Don't hesitate to do things on your own, whether it's traveling or exercising. Make your own money. Develop your own interests. Don't become a chameleon.  At a party, you don’t cling to the wall. You’re the person everyone clusters around because you’re fun. You laugh, but more importantly, you make other people laugh. You’re a conversationalist, and you aren’t afraid to talk to strangers.  Bad girls don’t tolerate abuse. They don’t let people call them names. They walk away if they’re not being treated right. Bad girls are strong. They are never, ever doormats., Bad girls don’t say they’re sorry. At least not for doing things their way or being themselves. Passive people are always saying they're sorry, and it's usually for being themselves. Apologize over the big things only. Be confident in your own actions.  What are you good at? What do you love? Whether it’s art, music, writing, hula hooping, softball, or something else, bad girls have something they love.   Tracey Emin was known as the “bad girl of art” in the United Kingdom partly because she was perceived as strong and confident “about her work.” Angelina Jolie’s passion – charitable works – didn’t mar her bad girl image. It just gave her more depth. Some bad girls show a hint of good girl. Passion is always a key part of a bad girl's personality. , Don’t ever tease someone cruelly. But a little flirting and coyness can be great. As the pop star Katy Perry put it, I'm kind of a good girl - and I'm not. I'm a good girl because I really believe in love, integrity, and respect. I'm a bad girl because I like to tease.”   Mae West perfected the art of teasing, especially using the sexy double entendre (words with double meaning). , Bad girls don’t need other people for their money. They make their own successes, and they do it the honest way.   Studies have found that men are attracted to girls with interesting jobs.Bad girls tend to have careers that are exciting and allow them to interact with people. They might have a non-traditional career, like police officer, pilot, or firefighter. Bad girls prefer independent professions. The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo had a skill. It was non-traditional, and she wasn’t afraid to use it.  Maybe they were bullied as a kid but that made them tough and empathetic to others. They are survivors. They’ve been through stuff, but you can’t tell. Still, it’s made them more interesting and stronger.   The models who grow up awkward and loser-y and just getting made fun of are the ones with the most character,” says model Binx Walton. “They know how to handle it.” , Bad girls don’t hang back waiting for other people to make up their minds or decide what to do. They know what they want, and others follow. Sometimes they break the rules, but never in a way that’s harmful. Ask someone to dance. Or go out on the dance floor first. Initiate ideas: Where to go out to eat, a big idea at work. Don't sit back, and wait for others to do it.  

show confidence.  avoid showing desperation.  leave a little mystery.  be independent.  be fun.  don't allow yourself to be mistreated.  don’t apologize.  find your passion.  be a tease.  have a career.  embrace your story.  take the lead. 

 That means cleaning up the front yard, porch and entrance-way to allow visitors to get to the front door without stepping through or over obstacles. On the actual porch, clear away boxes, boots and shoes and anything else that doesn't belong there (these sorts of things can go at the back or family entrance).   Clean up the walk from the street, sidewalk, or driveway. Remove brush, thorny plants, overhanging branches, toys, or other hazards. Make sure the walkway path itself is usable. Try to have cement, flagstones, gravel, or even a wooden walkway so people aren't stepping in water, snow or mud.; , When visitors approach from the street, drive or other public area, can they see which way to walk? They must be able to open the gate, for example. An archway, trellis, or other landscape feature is a good way to announce the entrance.  This means from the initial road entry through to the front door––anyone entering should be able to see their way clearly, both in dim light and dark night. To improve poor visibility, replace any broken or dim bulbs and clean and polish the light fixtures. You might even consider adding new light fixtures to improve both visibility and appearance.   Porch areas need at least 60- to 75-watt globes. Lower wattage will be too dim. Garden lights can be used to line a pathway or steer visitors off your lawn and toward the entry.  These could include potted plants, benches, paving stones, planter boxes, signs, statuary, bird baths, fountains, flowers, artwork, or decorative plants.   Even a simple straight path from the street can be made more interesting with cheap, used or free items. Visit yard sales or flea markets and see if you can find anything colorful that can sit in the outdoor weather and attract the eye.  This could be as simple as giving it a good scrub and wash down. Or, if it has faded over the years, repaint it to a vibrant new color. Almost anyone can paint a door if they are willing to try! If the door is in really poor condition, it might be time to replace it completely, both for the sake of your sense of security and for improving the appearance of the front of your house.   Oil any squeaky hinges and polish up any metalwork on the door, such as brass numbers. Don't forget the molding and framework around the door. If it's flaking, then it needs repainting too. Check the floor beneath the door. If it is chipped, dowdy, dull, then clean it and polish. You might need to paint, varnish or redo the floor, depending on its make and style. Don't neglect this aspect, as it adds to the overall impression.  You might have a small chair and table, a bowl of rocks or shells, a potted plant, a sign, a place for shoes or boots, an umbrella stand, hooks for hats or wet clothes, a brush for muddy shoes, a bin for walking sticks or canes, or some shade for hot days.   A decent, pretty doormat should be both functional and welcoming. Remove tatty doormats and either spruce them up or buy a new one. The doormat doesn't have to spell out welcome in letters (although some do), but it must make the visitor feel welcome. Chairs or seats at the front door can become dull and discolored over time. If you have these, check that the condition of the wood or other material is good; if not, clean it up and redecorate it to look like new. And replace worn and faded cushions to make it all feel better again.  If the front door is a place to sit and visit, to meet and greet visitors, to live in, it will definitely be more welcoming. Putting some chairs nearby in a conversational circle would be one way. Or just inside the door, make a space for visitors to transition into the house, with other chairs or benches to change clothes or shoes, to hang coats, set bags down, even to stop and admire a piece of art, a plant, or other decorative feature.   Don't allow obstacles at the front door. Don't make visitors step over a pile of shoes, the family dog, children's toys, or other things on the floor to get inside. This isn't welcoming.  

make sure your entrance is accessible.  have a clear access path to the door.  make sure the entrance is well lit.  add decorative features on the walkway or near the entrance.  have a nice front door.  at the front door, add features to make it look like a home.  make the front entrance a living space. 

 Only use enough foundation or concealer to hide imperfections. Don't make it look obviously done. Emo makeup on boys is usually a bit more subtle than on girls. Most Emo guys don't wear foundation or concealer but it can be a good technique if you have blemishes or scars. If using concealer, use the stick form as it goes on evenly and blends well. Tap your fingertips or use a concealer brush to blend it.  Put it carefully onto your lash line in one continuous line to give a smooth final result. Keep the line as close to your lashes as possible. The amount of eyeliner you apply depends on personal preference so try out different looks at home to find one you like. You can use a liquid liner to define and clean up the edge of your eyeliner.  This is optional but if you decide to apply eyeshadow then try to use a light amount and stay away from bright neon colours.   Charcoal eyeshadow is a good choice. You should put a little bit of eyeshadow under the eye. Boy Emo makeup is usually less dramatic than this same style on girls, though personal preference may change this.  You should always use black mascara when completing an Emo look.It is not recommended for boys to curl their eyelashes as this creates too much of a feminine effect. It is quite acceptable for boys and men to apply makeup. Many famous rockstars use makeup on a regular basis. The amount of eyeliner and mascara used on boys may come down to personal preference rather than gendered standards.  

apply foundation or concealer sparingly.  apply stick eyeliner.  use eyeshadow sparingly.  apply mascara to the upper lash line. 

 This unconventional trick can work surprisingly well, making it a favorite of many amateur cleaners on the internet.To start, find an old rag and dampen it with hydrogen peroxide. Lay your scorched item flat on your work surface and cover the scorch with the damp rag.   Hydrogen peroxide, a cleaning solution with mild bleaching properties, is usually available at grocery stores and pharmacies for quite cheap. If you have ammonia handy, you may also want to splash a few drops directly onto the scorch mark itself. Though ammonia and hydrogen peroxide are safe to use with each other (unlike ammonia and bleach), this isn't a mixture you'll want to ingest or rub into your face, so be sure to wash your hands when you're done.  Next, put a clean, dry rag on top of the hydrogen peroxide-soaked rag. To be perfectly clear, you want to have three things stacked on your work surface: on the bottom, your scorched item, in the middle, your peroxide rag, and on top, your dry rag.  Let your iron heat up to a fairly hot (but not extremely high) temperature. Start gently rubbing the top cloth. The heat will gradually permeate through the layers and into your scorched item, where it will help the hydrogen peroxide work into the scorch mark and start to remove it. Be patient — this process can take some time.  Check on your scorch mark frequently as you iron the top cloth. For mild to moderate scorch marks, you should notice steady, gradual improvement. If, at any point, you notice that the middle cloth is starting to dry out, remove it and give it another application of hydrogen peroxide. Similarly, if you initially sprinkled your scorched item with ammonia and you notice that it has dried out, give it a few more drops. Doing this keeps the cleaning process as quick and effective as possible.   You'll also want to remove the top cloth and replace it with another if it ever becomes soaked with hydrogen peroxide from the middle cloth. This prevents rust stains on the iron. 

cover the stain with a hydrogen peroxide-soaked cloth.  cover this with a dry cloth.  iron on medium-high heat.  replace liquids as they dry out. 

 Use purple foam if you want to make a violet, but other colors are fine if you'd like to make a different type of flower.  Cut evenly-spaced slits from the edge of the circle toward the middle, stopping about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) short of the center.  Lift each petal and cut an inverted "v" shape by making two diagonal cuts.  This will be the center of the flower.  Place a dab of hot glue in the center of the violet, then stick the small white circle to the glue.  Pinch each flower petal in half vertically, so they stand up a bit and created a 3-D effect, rather than lying flat.  Use a green pipe cleaner as the stem, and glue the top to the back of the flower's center.  

cut a circle from a purple piece of foam.  cut slits around the circle.  cut "v" shapes out of the petals.  cut a small circle out of white foam.  glue the circle to the center.  scrunch the flower petals.  glue the stem to the back of the flower. 

 A real hero knows that their actions might go unnoticed and that’s okay. Make sure you are trying to be a hero for the right reasons. You’ll need to be willing to help people who might not even know you have intervened in their lives. You’ll have to be focused more on the feeling you get from doing the good deed than the praise. Find the joy in seeing the smiles on other people’s faces. Think about how you would feel having a good deed done for you. That will help you connect to the joy or change you’ve created in another person’s life.; , A true hero isn’t all talk. They are constantly thinking about how they can take action and help. You may be inspired to be a hero for a certain cause or issue, or you may try to be a hero to someone in need.For example, if you are passionate about the environment, don’t just preach to people that they should recycle. Try to start an environmental club at your school or get your friends together to help you build a compost bin in your backyard. Maybe you are passionate about helping the homeless in your area. Rather than giving one homeless person money, you may get involved at your local homeless shelter and hand out food and basic supplies to the homeless in your area instead.  Think about what other people might need before you consider your own needs. When you are making decisions at work or at home, take some time to think about how your actions will affect someone else. If you take the day off of work, what kind of workload will that put on your coworkers?  Remember that people think differently. What seems comfortable or easy for you might not seem that way to other people. You might feel really confident going to a karaoke night with a bunch of strangers, but your friend or date might not. Consider what other’s want in addition to what makes you happy.  People lead busy lives. Often a typical person is so focused on themselves, they don’t notice or care to act when something is wrong. But a hero will be willing to take action and confront injustice straight on. Stick up for a friend, classmate, or coworker you feel is being treated unfairly. Buy a meal for the homeless person everyone keeps walking by on the street. Notice someone who is the underdog or who is less fortunate and give them a helping hand. You can also focus on creating safe spaces for individuals who suffer from injustice or prejudice. This could be advocating for a space on your campus for queer-identifying students, or a club for women of color to network and connect.  A hero doesn’t just intervene when they see wrong being done. A true hero is out to do good at any time. This might mean taking some extra time out of your day to look for a good deed. You can do anything from paying for the coffee of the person behind you in line at the coffee shop to helping some lost tourists find their way around the city. Other random acts of kindness you can do include:   Raking your neighbor's leaves for them. Helping to pay a student's tuition. Buying lunch for the office. Washing a friends car for them. Buying groceries for someone in need.  There are many charities and nonprofit organizations across the country that simply need people to volunteer a few hours each week to help them reach their goals. Offer to work for a local 5k marathon that is raising money for breast cancer or another cause you feel passionate about. You can also volunteer your time in other ways:Help build houses for low-income families. Join a community garden. Get involved with your neighborhood watch. You don’t always have to volunteer in such an official way. You can offer to help a friend move or give up some time to listen when a family member is in need of emotional support.  First think about the things you are good at or skills that have come in useful in the past. You can ask your friends and family what they think you are good at. They may already have a good idea about your strengths and how you can best utilize them to be a hero.  Think about how you can use your talents to help others.  Perhaps you are a great public speaker, or maybe you have a talent for making things with your hands like craft projects or furniture. Maybe you are a great listener and are good at being empathetic to the needs of others. You can also use your professional skills and knowledge to help others. If you are a teacher, you might volunteer some time to help tutor students who are having trouble in school. If you are an artist, you might volunteer your time and skills to help teach senior citizens how to paint or sketch.  Sometimes people need help but don’t know how to ask for it. Become the type of person who isn’t just waiting around for opportunities to be a hero. Make your own by asking others if there is anything you can do for them.   Think about what you had a hard time with when you started your job. Offer to assist new employees with working the copy machine, getting to know certain procedures, or setting up their email.  A hero understands that the little things in life can add up to big things. You can do small gestures like holding open the door for people or offering to take a friend out to lunch. You could give someone a ride to the airport or pay for someone's laundry at the laundromat.   Even offering someone kind words can help you grow as a hero. Say thank you to service workers. Tell a friend you appreciate them. Give a friend a hug. Write your teacher a thank you note. Send a family member a surprise email or text telling them you love them.  Speaking out against injustice is important, but speaking out in favor of peace is just as valuable.   Think about things in terms of “Pro” instead of “Anti”. Be pro-peace instead of antiwar. Be pro-environment instead of just antipollution.Be a good leader. If you are a teacher or in charge of a team at work, know that you have people that look up to you. Lead them by example. If they see you thanking people for their hard work, highlighting the achievements of others, and going out of your way to do favors, they are more likely to do the same.  A good hero is vigilant. They are aware of their surroundings and constantly on the lookout for situations where they may be of help to others. Start small. Think about the people you come across regularly in your daily life. The coworker in the cubicle next to you or the student who sits behind you in English class. What do you know about them? When might there have been an opportunity to be a hero to them in the past? How can you be ready for a similar opportunity in the future? If you are in line at the grocery store and the person behind you seems like they are in a hurry, let them cut in front of you. If you recognize that a fellow classmate is struggling in a class you excel at, offer to study with them after school. Watch for people on the subway who may need your seat. The elderly, a pregnant woman, someone on crutches.  Think about the people in your life who have acted like heroes. What were times when you felt lost or scared only to have another person come along and help you through a tough time? Maybe they were strangers. Perhaps a teacher or relative was there for you when you really needed someone. Think about what they did and how it made you feel.You can ask some of your own heroes for advice. Ask them how they are able to put others before themselves. Don’t be afraid to imitate..Chances are that the way someone helped you will work for other people as well. If a friend helped you by being a good listener, you can do the same for someone else.  

let go of your ego.  be the change you want to see.  put others before yourself.  be ready to act when others are passive.  perform random acts of kindness.  volunteer your time.  volunteer your talents.  ask if you can help someone.  use small gestures.  promote the good.being a hero is not just about working to put down the bad things in life like poverty, inequality, and oppression, it is also about working to promote and advance the good things in life like charity, kindness, gratitude and love.  be on the lookout for opportunities.  learn from your own heroes.no one becomes a hero all on their own. 

 Before you can even start to motivate or encourage your teens to get a job you have to get them excited about the idea. Most teens will question the reason for everything until they are satisfied with the answer.   Usually, it is not that the teen is “lazy” or that he does not want to do what is being asked of him, it is rather that he needs to have a personal connection to the motivation, a reason for why he is going to do this or why he is being asked to do it.; , For the teen, motivational reasons for wanting to get a job could include:   The chance to get valuable work experience. The chance to improve inter-personal skills. The chance to learn new skills like time management and more. The freedom to have spending money which teaches additional skills like responsibility and budgeting.  The teen that has shown no interest in getting a job may not be lazy but may be dealing with other problems.   Teens that are playing sports or trying to excel in school realistically may not have enough free time to pursue a low-paying, part time job and may not want their prior commitments to suffer. Over scheduled kids are often overwhelmed and may not see a way to add something else to his already overly busy schedule. Another issue could be a sense of low self-esteem. The teen does not want to try to get a job because he already feels as if no one will want him anyway. For this teen, preparation will be crucial because rejection could send him into a dangerous spiral of depression and despair.  Most kids will have some sense of fear because this is a new process for them. As a parent, it is important to separate normal fear and anxiety from the laziness and proceed accordingly.  If your teen is under age (18 in most states) help him to research the child labor laws in your state so that you will have an idea of how many hours he can work, what times he will be restricted to working and other legal information like wages, holidays and more.   This will not only help you to know when your teen will be working but may help him to be better prepared for the interview process. You may also need to find out if he will need a work permit before starting a job.  Most places do have applications online but others require you to come in and ask for one. Ask your teen if he would like for you to go with him to do this - he may have you wait in the car or he may want to do this on his own.   Set a reasonable goal with him and then make sure that he complies with the goal. Asking him to get five applications for a day is not asking too much.  Now is the tough part. The teen will need to fill out the application for himself. Answer questions and clarify things if he is stuck but do not stand over him while he does it and do not offer to fill them out for him. That is undermining the entire process.   Remember, you are not the one that is trying to get a job. Have him look up information for himself but give him some hints about where to find it. If he does not know his social security number by heart, for instance, you can tell him it is in your baby book and then let him go and get it.  Most teen's resumes will have virtually nothing on them beyond their school information but that is fine. The key is to teach him the process of creating and then updating a resume.   If you have not already done so, use a resume making program or a template to make the process easier (most word processing programs have many built in).  Before your teen takes any of the applications back to turn in, talk to him about rejection. Remind him that almost no one gets a job on his first try to that he likely to be passed over for a lot of the jobs that he is applying for. Eventually though, he will get called for an interview.  When your teen gets a call about an interview, you'll need to run through the basics of the interview process with him. Go over tips for what to wear but do not micromanage. Offer to do mock interviews with your teen so that he gets a feel for what to expect.   Ask him questions that he is likely to encounter during the interview and let him answer as he sees ft. After the mock interview is finished go over it with him. Did it go well in his opinion? What does he think could have been better? While it might be tempting to correct every single thing you found “wrong” wait for him to ask before offering advice. Part of the process is learning to fail with grace and dignity. Your teens will never learn that if they know you are always going to swoop in and fix everything for them.  It is important to be positive about your teen's chances of getting a job but not overly so. Be realistic but try not to make it all sound hopeless and dour.   Your teen needs to know the reality of what he is facing: adults who can work more hours in the same workplace, kids with better penmanship, a better appearance or better interviewing skills. Remind him that most of those things are things that he can work on - he can’t change competition in the workplace but he can be the best that he can be and that is good enough.  Remind your teen of the goal that they set for themselves and what they are working for, but do not withhold allowances or cut off all money thinking that this will be the key.   This can backfire and make them think that your love is conditional at a very critical time in their development. This can impact their self-esteem and may cause them to stop trying. Your job as a parent is to have healthy, happy and well-rounded kids that make it to adulthood with most of their joy and positive energy still in place.  Some teens will resist any effort and will do so with a lot of eye rolling, back talk and even outright disrespect.   The most important thing is to remind them that although they are almost adults, they are still living in your home and they need to follow the rules established there and contribute to the household. Set up a meeting with your teen and establish an agenda. Take a firm but loving approach and tell them that there will be no more of their behavior and that they will be following through on a job plan  , For example: "I will look for 5 jobs to apply to by the end of this week. I will follow up on 2 jobs by the end of next week." Do not critique their plan unless it is obvious that they are not even trying.  At this point, some of the words of the experts are going to have to give way to what works. If you cannot motivate your child out of a sense of pride or responsibility, hit him where it will hurt.   For example, you could tell your teen "if you fail to meet your goals, then your cell phone bill will not be paid for the month." Some family plans will let you turn numbers off for brief periods- so if you need to do that you can do so without penalty. When the teen has to use your phone for social or school related things, then he might pay attention to what you are trying to say.  If you are just letting your teen slouch on the couch while he is home and not earning his keep, then you are sending mixed signals.   Give him chores beyond what he normally does and tell him that if he is going to live there without a job then he will have to pitch in more. Sometimes one week of doing some of the more menial house tasks is more than enough to get even the most resistant teen up and out the door.  

get your teen excited about the idea of getting a job.  think of some ideas to motivate your teen.  try to understand any worries or concerns your teen might have.  help your teen to deal with any fear.  research child labor laws in your state.  get your teen to find out which places are hiring.  let him fill out the applications by himself.  help him get his resume in order.  talk to your teen about the possibility of rejection.  offer to help him prepare for his interview.  be encouraging but realistic about his chances.  do not punish your teen if he can't find a job.  set some ground rules for difficult teens.  give your teen a time frame to write up their job plan.  let your teen know about the consequences.  keep your teen busy at home. 

 Use a regular needle from a typical sewing kit. It'll be sharp enough to get the job done and minimize the risk of scarring. Soak the tip of the needle in rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide for one minute., Insert the needle at an angle. If you poke the needle in a vertical downward motion, you could hit live skin under the pus. Remove the needle as soon as you see pus oozing from the whitehead.   If you see clear liquid or blood instead of pus, stop. Squeezing a whitehead that isn't ready to be popped can cause it to swell and stick around even longer., Place each of your index fingers at the base of the white area. Squeeze in a down-and-in motion. Be gentle to avoid damaging healthy skin. Gently wipe away the pus with the tissue on your finger. Replace the tissue with a clean one to avoid infecting your skin. Continue until all the pus has drained. 

disinfect a sewing needle.  prick the surface of the whitehead.  squeeze the whitehead gently.

 In order to treat your specific struggle with stealing, it may benefit you to identify whether you engage in stealing behaviors, or if you may have a specific disorder.It is recommended that you seek consultation from a mental health professional.   Kleptomania exists in about .3-.6 % in the general population. In other words, about 1 in 200 people may meet the criteria for kleptomania as a disorder. 11% of people shoplift at least once in their lives.That is, over 1 in 10 people have shoplifted at least once. However, shoplifting once or twice does not constitute a disorder. Kleptomania is an impulse control disorder; it is associated with a “high” when engaging in stealing, followed by guilt after stealing. It is also characterized by an inability to control or stop the stealing despite repeated efforts.Stealing is not considered an addiction according to the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5), which is a reference guide for psychologists and psychiatrists in diagnosing mental disorders., The symptom of stealing could be part of a different disorder. For example diagnoses such as: Conduct Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, all have criteria that may include stealing-related behaviors.You also deserve assessment for other disorders that may be enabling the kleptomaniac habits, such as dissociative states, stress, anxiety, and mood disorders.  Ask for more information at your local library or bookstore. In the age of the internet, it's easy to find out more information about our health and well-being; just be sure to look on reputable sites, such as government health sites and sites written by doctors and psychologists, with referencing and verified expertise. As well, read posts and forums where people with the same disorder as you share their thoughts, feelings, worries, etc., as this will help you to realize that you're not alone.  

understand stealing versus kleptomania.  identify other causes.  conduct research about stealing. 

 Before you actually go shopping for a living Christmas tree, take the following into consideration:   Tree digging stops once the ground freezes. Unless you can find a nursery or farm that carries pre-potted trees, you'll have to do your shopping before the ground in your area freezes. This means you may have to purchase the tree several weeks before Christmas and find a proper place to store it, such as a patio. It can't be kept indoors for any more than 7 to 10 days or else it may die.3-5 days indoors is preferable so that the buds remain dormant and the tree avoids "winter kill" when moved outside.Consider when the tree can be planted. In some areas, the holiday season is an ideal time to plant trees. If this is not the case in your region, the tree will need to be stored and cared for outdoors until a good planting time arrives. Make sure that the tree will fit into your landscape and that the type of tree you are considering will ultimately thrive in your local environment. Some trees used as Christmas trees will eventually reach heights of 40 to 60 feet (12.2 to 18.3 m)! If coniferous trees are uncommon in your area, the environment may not be conducive to them (e.g. arid regions) and you'll have to look for drought-tolerant species (e.g. Arizona cypress). If you don't want to plant the tree on your property, find a neighbor, friend or organization who does want it, and make an agreement before you purchase the tree. Keep in mind that living trees are much heavier than cut trees because they come with roots and soil that must be kept constantly moist. For example, a 5–6 foot (1.5–1.8 m) tall balled and burlapped tree can weight up to 200 lbs!It may not be wise to purchase a living tree if you can't move it around without hurting yourself or damaging the tree (e.g. bad back, small doorways, stairs). If you anticipate difficulty moving the tree, consider buying a small, container tree.; , Make a list of local nurseries, garden centers, retail lots and choose-and-cut farms. Call ahead and ask if they have any container trees, or if they are willing to dig up a tree for you (instead of cutting it) and how much that will cost (or you can offer to dig the tree up yourself). Find out if you can order a tree to be picked up a few days before Christmas.If they have living Christmas trees available, visit to check the condition of the trees.  Whether they're in the ground, recently dug, or container grown, you should carefully inspect the trees to make sure they're healthy.   Feel the soil with your fingertips. It should be soft and moist. If it's hard and dry, it means the tree hasn't been watered properly. This may indicate poor practices on the part of the nursery or farm, so you may want to look elsewhere. Check the firmness of the root ball if the tree's roots are bound in burlap. It should be tightly packed. Trees with loose root balls are less likely to survive. Observe the needles. When shopping for any real Christmas tree, living or cut, you should run your hand gently along the branches. No more than a few needles should drop. Most of the needles should be green and firm, not brittle, yellowing or brown. Bend a branch gently. It should bend flexibly, not snap. Look for live buds. Determine the type of tree you're looking at. Most cut Christmas trees are Douglas and balsam fir, pine and spruce. Normally, the type wouldn't matter other than in terms of aesthetics, but since you might be planting this tree in your backyard, you'll want to consider how this particular type will fare in your environment.  If all you can find is a tree farm, you may need to dig the tree yourself. If someone else is doing the digging, you can watch carefully to make sure it's being done properly. Otherwise, the tree's chances of survival can be severely decreased through incorrect digging.   Make a circular trench that's a foot deep and six inches out beyond the drip line (where the tree's outermost branches will drip water onto the ground). Start from the outside in. Towards the trunk, you will encounter roots that dive into the ground--a small saw may be needed to cut these. Work a tarp in between the severed roots and the soil and use the tarp to hoist the tree onto a burlap square, which can be tied tightly around the roots.  When handling the tree, lift it carefully by the roots (not by the trunk). When you put it down, do so gently--don't let the roots hit the ground forcefully.  

think ahead.  shop around.  inspect the trees.  dig the tree properly.  handle the tree carefully. 

 Submerge a long-handled ladle into the center of the stockpot. The bottom of the ladle should touch the bottom of the pot.  Spin the ladle around the soup in a spiral pattern, working from the center of the stockpot out toward the edge.   You should notice foam and other fat gathering around the edge of the pot as you swirl the ladle around.  Use the cavity of the ladle to spoon away the fat gathered along the edge of the stockpot.   Hold the ladle at a slight angle and submerge it so that the rim just barely falls beneath the surface of the liquid. Skim along the surface, picking up as much fat as possible. Some liquid will also be lost in the ladle, but if you work carefully, it shouldn't be much.  

dip a ladle in the soup.  swirl the soup outward.  spoon away the fat.

 Does it matter whether your new dinnerware matches your old stuff? If so, you'll need to coordinate by material, color, or pattern. Unless you hate your current pieces, consider how you're going to keep on using them., For example, do you plan to use these dishes outdoors on a regular basis? If so, you may want to look into less common but unbreakable materials, such as metal or laminate. If you'll only use a formal set during the holidays, you might want to coordinate with festive colors., Dinnerware often comes in 5-piece (formal) and 4-piece (casual) sets. Consider whether you want all your dishes to match this way, as most retailers now offer dinnerware “open stock,” meaning that you can purchase individual pieces rather than sets. If you wish, you can mix and match different colors, patterns, textures and shapes.  It's probably not necessary to have a complete set of each, although it may be traditional. In theory, casual dinnerware is sturdy and designed for everyday use, while formal dinnerware is more delicate, but there's a lot of overlap here. If you find a good pattern, you might well be able to purchase a single durable, elegant set., Formal dinnerware is commonly made with bone china and porcelain; casual pieces may also be stoneware or earthenware.Porcelain is the hardest ceramic; bone china is nearly as strong because it is fortified by ox-bone ash. Both types are relatively expensive, and are often not ideal for dishwasher or microwave use because they are harder to replace. Many manufacturers now offer dishwasher-, microwave-, and oven-safe bone china and porcelain. Casual dinnerware should be sturdy, dishwasher-safe, and microwaveable; ideally, it should also be oven-safe to 400-500F. Such pieces are traditionally most often made of stoneware or earthenware (cream ware, majolica, faience, delft), which are less sturdy and less expensive than bone china or porcelain. However, porcelain and inexpensive bone china casual dinnerware is becoming quite common.  Plain white dinnerware is always very popular, because it's dishwasher safe, doesn't fade, matches most décor, showcases food well, and never goes out of style. However, you can also coordinate with your dining room or kitchen by picking a color. Dishware can also be plain or patterned.   If you have a brightly-colored dining room, neutral colors will complement it well. If you have neutral-colored décor, you can incorporate a bright color into your dishes that will bring out other aesthetic accents. When considering patterns, include some plain dinnerware with your patterns so they aren't overwhelming. Note that many patterns are created with decals or transfers and should be hand washed to prevent fading or removal. Gold- or any other metal-lined patterns should not be used in the microwave.  While smooth, round dishes are the most common and versatile, they can get boring. Your collection can be improved dramatically by adding a number of complementary pieces in dramatic shapes and textures. This is also a great time to consider some of the more unusual and dramatic materials and patterns.   For inspiration, look online and in magazines for Japanese table settings, where you'll see a wide range of shapes, colors, and textures used regularly.  While there are approximate standard sizes for most pieces, they do vary a lot.   If you are considering very large plates, be sure to measure the space inside your cabinets and dishwasher: a 12” plate will often not fit into a nominal 12” cabinet, for example. Some people find that large plates encourage overeating, while others find elegance in a plate’s “negative space.”, For serving, you’ll want 2-3 dishes, 2 bowls, 1 covered casserole, 1 cake platter or stand, and 1 coffee/tea service. These dishes do not need to match one another, and are a great place to branch out into dramatic shapes, colors, and textures.  Dinnerware needn’t be extremely pricey, but if you are buying a lot of pieces it will add up quickly. This is not a great place to be cheap, however. You hope to use these dishes every day for many years, so buy something you like and cut costs elsewhere.  Usually, this means 12 servings, which covers a fair-sized party smoothly. If you're on a budget, buy enough for the family and add to your collection later; in that case, be sure to buy pieces that are unlikely to be discontinued, or it can be very difficult to complete the set later.  You’d be surprised how many seemingly reputable department stores and the like have many, many horrible reviews: dishes that took six months to arrive, were broken in shipping, were refused for returns, and so on. If you are registering, be extra-careful: some places are infamous for simply not honoring purchases on registries, and when people complain they just refund the purchaser anonymously to a credit card.  

evaluate your current dinnerware.  define what range of uses your new pieces will have.  decide whether you want sets or not.  decide whether you're looking for casual or formal dinnerware.  choose your material based on durability, price, and intended use.  choose your color scheme based on your needs and your room.  choose shapes and textures, especially for accents.  measure tables and storage spaces in order to choose appropriate sizes.  consider whether you need serving pieces.  determine a budget for your purchases.  select as many settings as the number of people you can imagine hosting for dinner.  research dinnerware retailers thoroughly.

 You can’t be a country singer without being good at singing. Even if you consider yourself or have been told you are a good singer it is important to make sure you have the base singing skills necessary to be a singer. Find your singing range and practice singing regularly.If you have a lot of improvement that needs to be done or you just want to get your voice the best it can be, you might want to consider taking singing lessons. You can also use websites and phone apps to learn to sing.; , In order to mimic the sound and learn the country style, practice by singing along to country artists you like who are in your vocal range.

Men may want to listen to Hank Williams, Tim McGraw, George Strait, Waylon Jennings, Kenny Chesney, Keith Urban, George Jones, Rodney Atkins, and Toby Keith.  Country singers have a specific sound to their voice. Whether you have the country twang naturally or not it is possible to learn to sing with a country style to your voice.   First try to put the country twang in your speaking voice. Mimic the country twang of singers, actors, and characters into your speaking. Start singing with the twang by over exaggerating the sound of it. This will get the sound familiar on your voice. Once you have the feel of it down, tone it down. , This will help create your country sound and make song writing easier. If you really cannot learn you can have someone play while you sing and be a duo, but knowing how to play guitar is a major part of country singing.   The most important chords to learn for country music are G, C, D, and A. Country music is usually a combination of these chords. , There are plenty of country singers who cover other artist’s songs. Start by learning how to sing other country singers songs before you decide if you want to write your own music.  There are various types of country music. There is traditional country western music that is simple and about real life issues. Bluegrass is similar to country western, except it is entirely acoustic. It uses acoustic instruments such as the upright bass fiddle, acoustic guitars, banjos, and fiddles. There is also a newer genre of country music called pop-country. Which is pop music with a country feel. , You can write about whatever you want, but country music does tend to follow some of the same basic topics. Country music is stories set to music. There is usually a plot and characters just like a story except it rhymes and has a melody.   Common topics for country songs are broken hearts, betrayal, Jesus, the Devil, Mama, feeling blue, the South (Alabama, Tennessee, Louisiana, etc.), death, love, cowboys, and words of wisdom. , Once you have decided the subject to write about you can write the lyrics to your country song. There are plenty of sad country songs but the feel good songs are usually the hits. Country music is very literal so keep the lyrics simple. They should tell a story about what is happening around you or about what you know.   Unlike pop, the chorus is the most important part of country music. Use a lot of adjectives in your lyrics to describe something. Don’t use swear words. Some genres use or even encourage using swear words, but not country music. , People are going to remember the melody of your song before they remember the lyrics. You can build your song around the melody but don’t let the melody control your lyrics. The melody is a very important part of a country song. Without a melody you can’t feel the song and nobody will care about your song. Country songs have very simple melodies, harmonies, and chord progressions. The basic chord progressions to write your melody to is typically G, C, D or G, D, A, or a combination of those chords. There is typically no need for any fancy chord progressions. , There are many ways you can record your song depending on your resources and budget. You could work with a technical savvy friend, book time with a professional studio engineer, or just record your song at home using a microphone and computer software. Whatever way you choose to record your song, having a copy of an audio recording will open up many doors. , You music is copyrighted from the moment it is created, but if someone steals your music it is not protected in a lawsuit unless you register it. As soon as you have a final version written and recorded you can register it online at the U.S. Copyright Office for a small fee. Once you do this the song is yours. No one can use the original material without your permission. If you don’t do this someone can steal the lyrics or melody and make a new recording of it. They won’t need your permission or have to pay you any royalties. , Examples of PROs are ASCAP, SESAC, and BMI. They will collect any royalties and distribute them to you in an organized fashion. If your song is ever played on TV, iTunes, YouTube, or Spotify, you are entitled to royalty. Some PROs are free and others have a fee. , This will take a while but today’s technology makes this faster than ever. You can send your demos and mixtapes out to try to get noticed.   Send your demos to journalists, promoters, or management. Include your name, phone number, email address, and website on every CD that you send out. This way whoever listens to your CD will be able to contact you if they like it, whether they have your packaging or not. Keep your packaging simple. A simple note about who you are and any gigs you have will be good enough. Look through the album sleeves of country artists you like to find labels and managers to send your demos to. There are websites available such as Showcase, The Unsigned Guide and CMU Directory to help find the name and address of people to send your demos to. , Many singers get discovered when they perform their music live. Start with your friends, family, and those you feel most comfortable with. Then perform your music in the small venues: open mics, talent shows, and café’s.   Use who you know to get gigs. Even asking your friends to perform at birthday parties is a step in the right direction. Use the gigs you get to find more. If you make a good impression, promoters or someone in the audience might ask you to perform somewhere else. Ask small local venues or event organizer if you can perform at their venue or event. Try going to them in person or call over the phone instead of sending an email. , In order to stand out you need a fanbase. You will need to work hard to get fans to notice your work but having fans will open up many doors.   Publish your songs online. Once you have a clear recording of your song and you have copyrighted it, publish it. It is easy for anyone to publish their song online. Put your music on YouTube or Soundcloud so other people can see your work. Use social media to create fans. Use Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and other social media sites to get people to find you. Be active on social media and reach out to fans. Promote your music on your social media. Have an image. Be yourself but have something about you that makes you known.

This function sets our custom session handler so it is available for use as soon as the class is instantiated (i.e., made/built/constructed).__construct function:     function __construct() {    // set our custom session functions.    session_set_save_handler(array($this, 'open'), array($this, 'close'), array($this, 'read'), array($this, 'write'), array($this, 'destroy'), array($this, 'gc'));      // This line prevents unexpected effects when using objects as save handlers.    register_shutdown_function('session_write_close'); }      , This function will be called every time you want to start a new session, use it instead of session_start();. See the comments in the code to see what each line does.start_session function:     function start_session($session_name, $secure) {    // Make sure the session cookie is not accessible via javascript.    $httponly = true;      // Hash algorithm to use for the session. (use hash_algos() to get a list of available hashes.)    $session_hash = 'sha512';      // Check if hash is available    if (in_array($session_hash, hash_algos())) {       // Set the has function.       ini_set('session.hash_function', $session_hash);    }    // How many bits per character of the hash.    // The possible values are '4' (0-9, a-f), '5' (0-9, a-v), and '6' (0-9, a-z, A-Z, "-", ",").    ini_set('session.hash_bits_per_character', 5);      // Force the session to only use cookies, not URL variables.    ini_set('session.use_only_cookies', 1);      // Get session cookie parameters     $cookieParams = session_get_cookie_params();     // Set the parameters    session_set_cookie_params($cookieParams, $cookieParams, $cookieParams, $secure, $httponly);     // Change the session name     session_name($session_name);    // Now we cat start the session    session_start();    // This line regenerates the session and delete the old one.     // It also generates a new encryption key in the database.     session_regenerate_id(true);  }      , This function will be called by the PHP sessions when we start a new session, we use it to start a new database connection.open function:     function open() {    $host = 'localhost';    $user = 'sec_user';    $pass = 'eKcGZr59zAa2BEWU';    $name = 'secure_sessions';    $mysqli = new mysqli($host, $user, $pass, $name);    $this->db = $mysqli;    return true; }      , This function will be called when the sessions want to be closed.close function:     function close() {    $this->db->close();    return true; }      , This function will be called by PHP when we try to access a session for example when we use echo $_SESSION;. Because there might be many calls to this function on a single page, we take advantage of prepared statements, not only for security but for performance also. We only prepare the statement once then we can execute it many times. We also decrypt the session data that is encrypted in the database. We are using 256-bit AES encryption in our sessions.read function:     function read($id) {    if(!isset($this->read_stmt)) {       $this->read_stmt = $this->db->prepare("SELECT data FROM sessions WHERE id = ? LIMIT 1");    }    $this->read_stmt->bind_param('s', $id);    $this->read_stmt->execute();    $this->read_stmt->store_result();    $this->read_stmt->bind_result($data);    $this->read_stmt->fetch();    $key = $this->getkey($id);    $data = $this->decrypt($data, $key);    return $data; }      , This function is used when we assign a value to a session, for example $_SESSION= 'something else';. The function encrypts all the data which gets inserted into the database.write function:     function write($id, $data) {    // Get unique key    $key = $this->getkey($id);    // Encrypt the data    $data = $this->encrypt($data, $key);      $time = time();    if(!isset($this->w_stmt)) {       $this->w_stmt = $this->db->prepare("REPLACE INTO sessions (id, set_time, data, session_key) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)");    }      $this->w_stmt->bind_param('siss', $id, $time, $data, $key);    $this->w_stmt->execute();    return true; }      , This function deletes the session from the database, it is used by php when we call functions like session__destroy();.destroy function:     function destroy($id) {    if(!isset($this->delete_stmt)) {       $this->delete_stmt = $this->db->prepare("DELETE FROM sessions WHERE id = ?");    }    $this->delete_stmt->bind_param('s', $id);    $this->delete_stmt->execute();    return true; }      , This function is the garbage collector function it is called to delete old sessions. The frequency in which this function is called is determined by two configuration directives, session.gc_probability and session.gc_divisor.gc() function:     function gc($max) {    if(!isset($this->gc_stmt)) {       $this->gc_stmt = $this->db->prepare("DELETE FROM sessions WHERE set_time < ?");    }    $old = time() - $max;    $this->gc_stmt->bind_param('s', $old);    $this->gc_stmt->execute();    return true; }      , This function is used to get the unique key for encryption from the sessions table. If there is no session it just returns a new random key for encryption.getkey() Function:     private function getkey($id) {    if(!isset($this->key_stmt)) {       $this->key_stmt = $this->db->prepare("SELECT session_key FROM sessions WHERE id = ? LIMIT 1");    }    $this->key_stmt->bind_param('s', $id);    $this->key_stmt->execute();    $this->key_stmt->store_result();    if($this->key_stmt->num_rows == 1) {        $this->key_stmt->bind_result($key);       $this->key_stmt->fetch();       return $key;    } else {       $random_key = hash('sha512', uniqid(mt_rand(1, mt_getrandmax()), true));       return $random_key;    } }      , These functions encrypt the data of the sessions, they use an encryption key from the database which is different for each session. We don't directly use that key in the encryption but we use it to make the key hash even more random.encrypt() and decrypt() functions:     private function encrypt($data, $key) {    $salt = 'cH!swe!retReGu7W6bEDRup7usuDUh9THeD2CHeGE*ewr4n39=E@rAsp7c-Ph@pH';    $key = substr(hash('sha256', $salt.$key.$salt), 0, 32);    $iv_size = mcrypt_get_iv_size(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB);    $iv = mcrypt_create_iv($iv_size, MCRYPT_RAND);    $encrypted = base64_encode(mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256, $key, $data, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB, $iv));    return $encrypted; } private function decrypt($data, $key) {    $salt = 'cH!swe!retReGu7W6bEDRup7usuDUh9THeD2CHeGE*ewr4n39=E@rAsp7c-Ph@pH';    $key = substr(hash('sha256', $salt.$key.$salt), 0, 32);    $iv_size = mcrypt_get_iv_size(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB);    $iv = mcrypt_create_iv($iv_size, MCRYPT_RAND);    $decrypted = mcrypt_decrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256, $key, base64_decode($data), MCRYPT_MODE_ECB, $iv);    $decrypted = rtrim($decrypted, "\0");    return $decrypted; }      , Here we just end the classes curly brackets:End Class:     }      

create class.  create __construct function.  create start_session function.  create open function.  create close function.  create read function.  create write function.  create destroy function.  create gc (garbage collector) function.  create getkey function.  create encrypt and decrypt functions.  end class. 

 If you time it right, you can hit department stores during their deep discount periods.The best way to ensure you are there to snag a deal is by simply asking the manager when they do their big markdowns.  Most have a specific day of the month or season when they do this so knowing the date means you will be first in line for the best picks.; , Kid specific clothing stores such as The Children’s Place and Gap Kids heavily discount items every time a new clothing line moves in.  This usually happens once or twice a season.  Ask them about signing up for email alerts, coupon mailers, and store point cards to get even bigger discounts.  The Children’s Place, for example, offers Monster sales several times a year where you can find clothing and shoes up to 60% off. If you have their online discount codes or printed coupons you get even more of a discount.  If you also have their point card and enough points you can redeem those for a discount on top of that.   , Basically, there are hundreds of different websites and deals begging for you to save money.So you don’t waste time searching several sites to find what you’re looking for.  Friday’s bring a fresh list of discounts, promo codes, and coupons from all your favorite baby gear stores.  This saves you time and gives you the benefit of knowing about discounted items before you even knew you were looking for them.  

find out when the sales are.  sign up for email alerts.  use the right websites. 

 Each player now has a "hand" of (probably) seven cards. Give the players a few moments to arrange their cards in an effective way. This is when most experienced players begin to make connections between their cards and plan out the beginnings of their strategy.  Once everyone has the right amount of cards, the dealer picks up the card at the top of the deck places it face-up in the Discard pile. Then, the dealer picks the next card and lays it on the table for everyone to see. This is the starting card. If it is a power-up card (e.g. Draw Two, Draw For, Wild), deal another card on top of it.  Start from the card that is face-up in the center of the table. The player who is going first puts down a card that of the same number or color from his or her own 7-card hand. Then the person on the left (clockwise) or right (counterclockwise) does the same. The game continues in that direction. The goal of the game is to get rid of all your cards – the last person holding cards "loses".  

let everyone look through their cards.  place one card face-up on the table.  play uno. 

 If you are low on money because you don't have a job, don't give up. Keep looking for one if you are old enough. If your school doesn't make you wear a uniform (which can be cute as well! Look at the girls in Gossip Girl for some cute high fashion accessories that can make your uniform even hotter.), find that one store where the jeans always fit you and you like everything they sell. For a preppier look, go to stores such as Abercrombie & Fitch, Gap, Wet Seal, Aeropostale, American Eagle, and Hollister. For a high fashion look, search stores such as Juicy Couture, Nordstroms, Fashion outlets such as Loehmanns, and Forever21 (A lot of people say that Forever21 is too cheap looking, but if you shop online, a lot of the stuff is more high quality. Jeans are very inexpensive as well.) If you want to achieve that cool scene/emo look, go to stores like Hot Topic. Find that one store!; , Hopefully it will be someone famous and beautiful, someone you think always dresses well. If it's Kate Moss, search topshop.com for her line. If it's Paris Hilton, look through her extensive lines of clothing and jewelry. If it's Blake Lively, search cwtv.com. There are countless celebrities out there with styles that are just begging to be brought into your own wardrobe! If you have trouble finding stuff you like while shopping, constantly ask yourself "Would Angelina Jolie buy this?"  , Follow your unique style! Never wear all one label of clothing, it will make you look totally unoriginal.  Don't act fake and be nice to the people around you, but don't be rude either. Being someone well liked at high school means that you're loved by all. So always have a smile on your face!  , Chances are, the young guy behind you doesn't have the nerve to say something yet either! Compliment someone! Even a "I love that purse!" or "I wish I could do my makeup as good as yours!" will make someone's day! Being popular means being nice!  , Save that for the many parties you'll be invited to now that you're popular! You will only need the basic stuff: Concealer (Get something non-comedogenic, so you won't breakout even more, I would recommend brands such as Yves Saint Laurent, Bobbi Brown, Nars, or Mac. (Nars is the best place to go for makeup because they will find the foundation and concealer that makes your skin looks FLAWLESS!). For foundation or blush, go to a professional makeup counter to find the right color, because the wrong kind of color can make your face look dirty and tired. For mascara try Covergirl's last blast. For lip gloss try Sephora, YSL Golden Gloss, or Lancome's Juicy tubes. For some light eye makeup, such as a bit of black charcoal liner, and for a very light base color to make your eyes stand out even more, try Bobbi Brown! If you're going out, you can always experiment with smoky eyes, or a bold color of eye liner. Hey sexy!  , Find a good face wash and cleanse your face twice a day. Make sure ALL OF YOUR MAKEUP is removed before you go to sleep, or you'll breakout really badly. Using a toner after your cleanser can help to remove any traces of makeup and impurities. If you have acne, invest in a good acne cream that suites your skin type. Don't let your confidence fall because you have acne, instead treat your skin and try to improve it. Remember, in high school, almost more than 80% of teens breakout, so don't feel too self conscience if you have acne.  Make sure people know your signature scent, but please, ONE spray only! No one should be able to smell you coming down the hall. It should be very light, and the only people who should be able to smell the perfume, are the people that are less than a foot away from you. Try to find your signature scent. Ask for samples at your local Nordstroms! They'll be happy to help. Try scents such as, Armani Code, La Perle Charme, Bath and Body Works, Pacsun's signature perfume, No Abercrombie though, Vera Wang's Princess, etc! Use a shampoo and conditioner that smells great!  , Go to the gym and take a class! Stay in shape and you'll feel more confident about yourself, not to mention that you'll look fantastic!  , Don't slouch! You might think that people don't look at your posture, but they do! Nothing is more unattractive than someone whose shoulders are slouched forward ALL the time. (Try watching One Tree Hill, and look at the main character, Peyton's shoulders. She's a prime example of a beautiful girl, who could be 10x prettier if she put her shoulders back!)  , Hair on your legs or under your arms is a real turn off! NEVER forget to wax! Boys love good smelling, moisturized, and smooth skin! It's better to wax rather than shave: It will last longer and the hair will grow thinner.  Two weeks before your school starts, go get your hair done, girl! Go to a professional salon to avoid looking ridiculous on your first day of school. All the celebs have highlights and lowlights, so why can't you? They're not too expensive, and they make you look much more sophisticated. Bring in a few pictures of a haircut that you like so your stylist knows what you want.  Try to spend an hour in the library everyday! It makes you feel good about yourself and you won't be labeled as just pretty.  Teeth whitening is something that makes your smile more noticeable and prettier. Even if you can't whiten your teeth then still smile all the time (except when everyone is mourning over something). And bad breath is a total turn-off.)  ,"'say it everyday, and soon the rest of the world will know it too.  Try to talk to people you haven't met because being popular means knowing lots of people and being liked by mostly everyone. Start with a simple compliment like "Hey, I love your hair! How did you get it so shiny?" Also, make your locker stand out from the rest. It'll make people stop by and maybe ask to use your mirror. It gives you a chance to talk to someone new.  

shop till you drop!!,  find a style icon.  create your own image.  be yourself!,  talk to people!,  don't wear a lot of makeup.  helping your skin stay clear and beautiful boosts your confidence.  always smell fabulous!,  before you go back to school, exercise!,  have good posture.  wax!,  get a new hairstyle.  get good grades!,  whiten your teeth.  always remember this (repeat it as your mantra) "i am beautiful, sexy, and smart.  don't sit at the same lunch table everyday. 

 Add 2 tablespoons of water.; ,, It is recommended that you stir them once during the process. On average, cooking time is as follows:   Thin slices will take about 6-9 minutes Strips will take about 5-7 minutes Baby carrots will take about 7-9 minutes.  Microwaved carrots can be added to many meals as a side dish or vegetable accompaniment.  

place 1 pound/450g of cleaned carrots into a casserole dish or microwave dish.  cover the dish.  ,  microwave on high (100 percent power) until tender.  serve hot. 

 U.S. citizens, and non-citizens authorized to work in the U.S., are eligible to receive a Social Security Number or a replacement card if they lose the first one.This is the most common identification number used to file individual tax returns.   On Form 1040—the form most individuals use to file their income taxes—the default TIN is the filer's SSN, and there is a designated space for this number in the upper-right corner of the first page of the form.Thus, if you are filing as an individual and already have a SSN, you will not need a separate TIN, and should simply use your SSN when filing taxes.; , In most cases, you will need at least two documents that prove your identity ,such as a driver's license or state-issued identification card. If you are applying as a US citizen, one of these must be a US birth certificate or US passport.To check your exact requirements, visit the Social Security requirements page and select the buttons on the left that describe your individual situation. The page will update to display exactly which documents you will need to obtain either a new or replacement SSN. All documents should be originals, or official copies certified by the issuing agency.   Select Child if you are applying on behalf of someone under 18. Otherwise, select Adult. Select Original if you never had an SSN, or Replacement if you once had a card but no longer do. If you are at least 12 years old and have never had an SSN, you will need evidence that you never had an SSN, such as an old tax form or any documents showing you lived outside the US.Select U.S. Born Citizen, Foreign Born Citizen, or Noncitizen as applicable. Photocopies, or even notarized copies, of required official documents are not accepted by the IRS. In addition, the documents must be current and unexpired. A receipt stating that you applied for a particular document is not acceptable in lieu of the actual document., Print out Form SS-5 and fill out the application on the last page. If you do not have access to a printer, visit the Social Security office locator to find an office near you. The office locator will display contact information and operating hours for the IRS office closest to your zip code.Call or visit this office to request Form SS-5, which will be provided to you free of charge.   Be sure to read the first four pages of Form SS-5 before you complete the last page, as they provide detailed instructions on how to complete the form., Use the online office locator to find a Social Security office near you. Mail the completed form and documents to this office and your Social Security card will be mailed back to you along with the documents you submitted to support your application.You can choose to visit the IRS office nearest you in person to apply for a new or replacement SSN. Doing so is recommended if you would otherwise be required to mail—and therefore be without for some time—important documents that you use in daily life, such as a driver's license or passport. If you are 12 or older and have never received a SSN, you must apply in person., If you are employed by a U.S. organization, it will need your SSN to report your wages to the IRS. If your employer is not sure what to do while you are waiting for a SSN, refer them to this website for instructions.  

determine if you are eligible for an ssn.  gather documents.  fill out the application form.  submit the form and accompanying documents.  let your employer know you've applied. 

 Get a nice sheet of paper, a sharpened pencil, a rubber. If you wish to make it colourful, you could get some colours too. For starting an artwork, you always need to gather you supplies so that you can concentrate on drawing rather than your stuff.; , This would act as the foundation of the drawing. Always remember, never ever use a ruler for drawing a line or any shape. If you can't draw a straight line without a ruler, a little practice could help you.  After all, the pot should be on something. It can't float in air. But for right now, don't make a very detailed table. make it simple. By the way, don't use a ruler for it. For drawing the table draw an elliptical shape and draw another under its lower half to give it a 3D look. Draw the leg of the table under it. You could draw the foot anyway you want. You could also make a rectangular table if you want.  It is the leaves that could make anything look like a plant. Don't draw very detailed leaves just draw some spades around the line.  We don't want the stem to look 1D. It should look 3D.  Erase the upper part of the pot and draw an ellipse. Join the sides of the pot with the ellipse and then draw a smaller ellipse inside the larger one. Give effects to it to make it look like soil and draw some small lines on the spot where the plant is attached with soil to make it look irregular. Make the spade on the plant look like leaves by drawing a little line in the middle part of each leaf. Make the ends of the leaves rounded.  Draw some rounded lines on the upper part of the table to make it look like wood. Add some lines on the leg too. Make it look irregular like wood and not flawless like marble. 

gather what you need.  make the basic structure start with a rectangle with a line sticking out from it.  make a table under the rectangle (which later become the pot).  add leaves on the line sticking out of the rectangle.  add another line.  make the sides of the pot slanting.  add details to the table.  add some colours if you want.  

 You will never get table service in a pub for drinks. Well, let’s not say never. You will get table service in the occasional snooty London wine bar. Suffice to say that if you don’t look at the drinks menu and think, “Are these prices for bottles or glasses?” then you’re not getting table service. You’re also unlikely to find a drinks menu on your table––to find out which drinks they have, you generally need to go to the bar and look at the beer taps. They may also have some sort of board on the wall showing beer and wine. On the up side you will never be expected to tip for drinks. Once you’ve decided what you and your party want to drink, someone will have to go to the bar and buy the round.; , Customers waiting at the bar are rarely served in the order in which they arrived. The most reliable method for being served promptly is to stand close to the bar (perhaps leaning gently on it, but not right over it) and smile as often as possible at a bartender of your choice. Things that will get you served faster than average are:   Being attractive, and of the opposite sex to the bar person Being tall Knowing the bar person  , 

know that there is no table service.  know the art of getting served.  things that will get you served slower than average are:  shouting or whistling  waving money  leaning right over the bar  being noticeably drunk (unless also attractive, in which case this may be a positive feature)  being small  being clearly a part of an enormous group and therefore about to try to buy seventeen drinks, a third of which you’ve forgotten already and another third of which you’re going to have to shout back to your friends to find out what they want  sounding english (in scotland)  sounding scottish (in england)  sounding french (universal)  

 But first rest the head of your putter on the ground. Unlike most standard grips, the cross-handed grip begins with your right hand. With your right palm facing upwards, allow the club to rest across your right palm so that the heel of your hand and the end of the club are even.The cross-handed putting grip is especially effective and assisting with an even putting stroke. If you have difficulty with even strokes in your putting, this grip is recommended., Your right hand, at this point, should be loose and your right thumb should be in line with the handle of the putter. Your fingers should be arranged closely together so there is no space between them., Your left pinkie finger will need to be sandwiched between the knuckle of your right forefinger and middle finger. Keep the remaining fingers of your right hand loose and uncurled around the handle. You'll first want your left pinkie link to your right grip with a hold that is comfortable, yet firm., The remaining three fingers of your left hand will curl around the handle. Your left thumb should lay atop the thumb of your right hand. Both thumbs should follow the length of the shaft of the club so both are in alignment with it.   Holding the club in this fashion will help keep your left wrist firm as you putt. This will encourage more even putting. The cross-handed grip can look or feel awkward while you are getting used to it. It may take you some time before it becomes natural. 

take your putter in your right hand.  wrap the fingers of your right hand around the shaft.  link your left pinkie to your right hand grip.  add the remaining fingers of your left hand to the grip. 

 Even if your partner cheated on you or hurt you in the worst way possible, you are likely guilty, as well. Ask yourself what you may have done to contribute to your ex’s bad treatment. It may be difficult to admit to any wrongdoing on your part, but if you are honest with yourself, you may find that you displayed certain behaviors that could have caused your partner’s bad treatment.   Your part could be something as small and innocent as having to work more, and this may have caused your ex to feel insignificant to you. Or perhaps you became distant and your ex looked to someone else for companionship or love. Even if what you’ve done didn’t warrant the treatment you received, there’s a good chance you weren’t completely innocent, at least in the eyes of your partner.; , Sometimes, people look for partners they know will love them, even if they don’t necessarily feel the same way. As such, they may not put in all they could, and the other partner leaves as a result. Even if you saw this relationship as one that was to give you what you needed at the time, you can still feel quite devastated when it ends.For instance, maybe you were in a relationship simply because you feared being single. Perhaps your partner sensed this and became distant from you. Can you think of any ways that your unhappiness or dissatisfaction in the relationship (or even with yourself) could have contributed to the breakup?  , Sometimes it’s hard to have the right perspective unless you are outside of the relationship. Ask people close to you for honest opinions about how you treated your ex. They can likely give you insight into your behaviors and what you may have done wrong.Go to a close friend or family member and say, “I’m trying to get a better understanding about my role in our breakup. Can I trust you to give me an honest assessment of my behavior?”  , Examine why you behave the way you do. You may find that certain situations cause you to act in certain ways. These behaviors may have led to the destruction of your relationship.   Perhaps you shut down when you are confronted, or maybe you fly off the handle when you are accused of doing something wrong. Taking a good look at yourself and figuring out why you respond the way you do, can help you to figure out how to combat these habits., When you endure a breakup, it’s easy to continuously play it out over and over in your head. However, doing so is self-destructive and also prevents you from being able to move on. Stop torturing yourself and realize that obsessing isn’t healthy for you and won’t change the past.   Are you sitting around in your pajamas trying to find the one straw that broke the proverbial camel's back? Maybe you're reliving that last conversation with yourself over and over again. Ruminating like this doesn't solve anything--it only makes you feel worse. People tend to think more during downtimes. One way to stop yourself from obsessing is to keep yourself busy doing positive activities like setting goals or decluttering your house. You’ll probably start out slow, but overtime you’ll likely find that you are able to stop thinking about the relationship less and less., Do you feel like you always pick the wrong person? Or that you always make the same mistakes in relationships? If so, it’s time to make some changes. Take a good look at the patterns you display in partnerships and ask yourself if making different choices would have made you happier. If so, then figure out what those changes are and implement them.For instance, if you tend to get lost in your relationships and detach from friends and family, you should take the time while you are single to mend those distant relationships. The next time you enter a relationship, be sure to keep nurturing those connections that existed before you met this special girl or guy.  Even after doing a deep analysis about your behaviors and relationship patterns, you might not be able to gain perspective about your role in a breakup. Talking to a qualified mental health therapist may help you unearth some buried issues of your own that may have contributed to the relationship’s end.   Plus, working with a professional can help you develop healthier, positive habits to assist you in forming relationships in the future.Talk to your doctor about referring you to a therapist. Since your doctor already has an established relationship with you, they might know of a therapist that aligns with your unique needs. Don't hesitate to try out a few professionals before selecting one you like.  You will likely reach the point in which you are able to admit your faults to others. When this happens, you may want to apologize to your ex for your role in the breakdown of your relationship. You may feel a sense of relief when it happens, especially if you are holding onto any guilt.   Apologizing to your ex, particularly if you have children together, can make your life much easier. You may find that visitation drop offs and pickups are far more pleasant, and you may see that your child’s behavior is positively affected.You might say, "I wanted to take the time to apologize to you. At first, I felt like I was the victim in all of this, but, after doing some thinking, I can see that you were hurt, too. I'm sorry for my part in it."  , Learning from your mistakes is key to moving on in your life. Examine what behaviors you don’t like about yourself or what contributed to the falling out of your relationship. Making changes and then implementing them won’t ensure a perfect relationship, but it gives you a fighting chance.Maybe you find that you jump into physical intimacy too soon when starting a relationship, leading to an unhealthy attachment. Next time around, you might choose to truly get to know the person and develop an emotional attachment to them before progressing to a sexual connection.  The only way to get closure from a failed relationship is to accept responsibility and then forgive yourself. Doing this will likely take some time and may require real effort.

 Dictionaries, phone books, and encyclopedias are excellent choices for pressing flowers. The moisture from the flowers will cause the pages to wrinkle, so be sure to choose books that can be damaged.  You will need four pieces of paper, two of which will serve as blotters. Place two sheets of paper on either side of the book.  Using the directions outlined above, choose flowers to lay flat or arrange artistically. You are only limited by the size of the book.  Be careful to close it in such a way that the flower arrangement does not get disturbed, and the paper stays aligned with the book.          If you have a lot of flowers, you can place more flowers at different parts of the book. Make sure to leave about half an inch (1.3 cm) between the pages so your flowers don't transfer moisture to the other flowers in the book. Too many will cause mold. Pile more heavy books on top of the pressing book, and store them in a dry place in your house.  Carefully open the book to the pages where you're pressing flowers and remove the under sheets of paper you are using as blotters. Replace them with fresh blotter sheets, close the books, and continue to let the flowers press.  After a few weeks, the flowers will be completely dry. Gently open the layers of paper and gently remove the flowers preferably with a pair of tweezers. You can use your fingers but be very careful. They are very delicate now.         

find a heavy book.  lay the book open and line it with paper.  arrange flowers on one side of the book.  close the book.  change the blotter sheets every few days.  remove the flowers from the books. 

 In MLA, the guidelines have a division between a broadcast television episode and one that is recorded. However, they both begin the same way and only change after you write the name of the series.; , Put quotation marks around it because it is a short work. You will use the title to alphabetize it in the reference page. Use a period before the last quotation mark. Next, put the show title in italics:   "'The Wind in the Tree.' Fashion for Winners." If it is a recorded episode, use the title of the disc or DVD set: "'The Wind in the Tree.' Fashion for Winners: The Second Season."   , In the broadcast citation, you next write the station (with a period) plus the call letters of the station, a comma, and the location. Then, you'll include the date it aired, plus the fact that it was on television:   "'The Wind in the Tree.' Fashion for Winners. Fox. WBT, Okemah. 15 Jan. 2009. Television."  , For a recorded program, you'll next include the distributor and the date it was published. Also, you add what you viewed it on after a period following the date:   "'The Wind in the Tree.' Fashion for Winners: The Second Season. Jon and George Movies, 2011. DVD." If you want, you can also include information about the director, actors, and so on, with the addition of abbreviations in front of their names. You place these names between the title of the series and the distributor's name: "'The Wind in the Tree.' Fashion for Winners: The Second Season. Dir. Jessie Job. Jon and George Movies, 2011. DVD."  , For the in-text citation, all you'll need is a shortened form of the title in parenthesis, unless the title is short already:   "In the series Fashion for Winners, George talked about his love of beads ("The Wind in the Tree").  

note that mla differentiates between broadcast and recorded tv shows.  start with the title of the episode.  create the rest of the citation for a broadcast episode.  finish up the citation for the recorded episode.  create an in-text citation. 

 Make sure your potential gastroenterologists are board certified and formally trained. In addition to a three year residency, a gastroenterologist must complete a two to three year residency for specialized training.Look for one with an active license and no known charges against them.  Look up the website for your state's medical board. Click the link for "licensee search," and type in the gastroenterologist's name, city, and address. This will tell you when the doctor was licensed, what year their license expires, and if they have any complaints or disciplines registered against them.  Many physician private practices and hospitals have profiles on review websites, such as Yelp. Search for your prospective gastroenterologist on specific review sites, and run a general search on a search engine. You can also contact the office or hospital and ask if they can provide patient satisfaction surveys or testimonials.Remember that online reviews aren't always objective or authoritative, so take them with a grain of salt.  Contact your local business boards or view their websites. Look for your prospective gastroenterologists’ private practices or for their hospital and check their rating.A Better Business Bureau or Chamber of Commerce rating will give you information about your prospective physicians’ business practices. You can also get a referral to a gastroenterologist from a Better Business Bureau or Chamber of Commerce.  A good gastroenterologist should have years of training and plenty of experience performing procedures like colonoscopies. If you have a specific disorder, you should contact your prospective physicians to ensure they specialize in your illness.For example, if you’re having a colonoscopy, you should choose a gastroenterologist who performs more than 100 procedures per year. They should routinely remove any polyps they find during the colonoscopies they perform. If you have a specific disorder, your best option is to get a referral from your primary doctor.  Have a conversation with a prospective gastroenterologist to get a feel for their personality and bedside manner. Choose one who makes time for you, communicates clearly, and thoughtfully engages your questions.Ask their office if the physician can spare a minute or two for a quick phone or in-person conversation. If not, you may need to make an appointment to visit them. Ask the gastroenterologist questions about your required procedure: "Will I need to be sedated? Do I need to fast before the procedure? Are there any potential complications?" If you feel that they're rushing you or using unfamiliar, unapproachable jargon, try to find another specialist.  

verify potential gastroenterologists’ credentials.  look online for reviews and patient satisfaction surveys.  check with your better business bureau or chamber of commerce.  ask about their experience with your specific procedure or illness.  evaluate your potential physicians' communication styles. 

 If you have a particularly stubborn infection on your computer, it may become impossible to solve the infection without reinstalling your operating system. Sometimes, using anti-malware programs may also damage your computer.   Copy your files to a USB flash drive. If you have access to an online file backup service, use that.; , There are many free options available, such as Malwarebytes Antimalware or SuperAntiSpyware. Some anti-malware programs allow on-demand free trials, and are therefore also usable for removing malware.   If you already have an anti-malware program installed, then update the virus definitions. Anti-malware definitions need to be kept up-to-date in order for the anti-malware programs to remove viruses. If a virus prevents you from downloading or running an anti-malware program, run the program in Safe Mode with Networking by tapping F8 repeatedly when your computer is starting up, and selecting "Safe Mode with Networking". This works because only operating system core files start up in Safe Mode. If running the anti-malware program in Safe Mode also does not work, you can use Malwarebytes Chameleon or Rkill to kill malware processes which may be preventing you from running an anti-malware product.  Quarantine or clean any infections that are found.   Be sure to turn on "Scan for Potentially Unwanted Programs" in the program's settings. Some programs may have legitimate uses, but can also be used by hackers for malicious reasons; this is why they are considered potentially unwanted. Potentially unwanted programs include keyloggers and adware, which may have legitimate uses. Update your virus definitions before scanning.  If it is not, then install a different program and see if it becomes fixed. If no programs can fix your problem, then you may want to consider reinstalling your computer. Note that there still may be malware left on your computer even if the malware problem appears to be fixed. Use a different anti-malware application, just to make sure.  

back up your important files.  download an anti-malware program.  scan with the anti-malware program.  check to see if the problem has been fixed. 

 Controlled breathing, as the name suggests, is when you deepen your breathing in order to clear out any phlegm that may be in your lungs.To perform controlled breathing:   Take two to three big breaths. Try to inhale as much air as you possibly can, and then exhale as much as you possibly can. Taking these deep breaths will help to get air behind the phlegm so that you can spit it out later. Take four or five regular breaths, and then two or three more deep breaths. Repeat this step once more, switching between regular breaths and then deep breaths. After your last set of deep breaths, begin making huffing motions, as if you are trying to clear your lungs (which you are). Take two to three regular breaths, and then try to cough up the rest of the phlegm. Repeat this whole procedure as needed or until you feel your lungs are cleared.; , Coughing is the body’s natural way of eliminating secretions from the lungs.You can still easily perform this coughing technique when you are already running. To perform controlled coughs:   Find a chair or bench where you can sit. Lean forward with your arms placed across your stomach. Leaning forward promotes maximum lung expansion. Take one deep breath and hold it for three seconds. As you breathe in, you should feel your stomach getting bigger against your arms. Open your mouth slightly and make short and sharp coughs. While doing this, exert pressure on your diaphragm by pushing your arms against your stomach in an upward motion. Inhale through your nose in a gentle and slow manner. Inhaling in this way will help to keep secretions from going back into your lungs. Spit out the secretion.  When someone pats your back, it can help to loosen up the phlegm in your lungs. Ask someone to perform the following:   Have the person place his hands in a cup shape. Have him tap your back while his hands are in the cup shape. Start from the middle of the back and move upwards. This motion can help loosen the phlegm and cause it to be excreted through the mouth.  

practice controlled breathing.  use a controlled coughing technique.  have someone pat your back firmly. 

 If you are just beginning to learn English, it is best to begin by taking a class. A qualified teacher can guide you through the basics of English and help you understand the way the language system works.   If you cannot take a class, try to find an online language acquisition program.; , Find a dictionary or online app that offers translations of words from your native language to English and from English to your native language. This can help you in the early stages of learning English as you master your vocabulary acquisition.  Once you have a basic understanding of the way that English works, spend some time expanding your vocabulary.You may want to find English flashcards in your language.   If you feel that you have a mastery of everyday vocabulary words but wish to learn more, try finding some advanced vocabulary flashcards, such as those used by American students studying for the GRE, an exam required for entrance into graduate school. Reading in English and circling words that you’re unfamiliar with, then looking up the words and making an effort incorporate them into your vocabulary is a great way to increase your vocabulary.  Many public libraries offer resources for English Language Learners. They may even host free classes for community members who wish to improve their language fluency. This is more common in areas with a large community of language learners. The library also may have books or audio books that you can check out for free.  The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) can help you learn how to pronounce words that you see in writing but don’t know how to say. The book should provide a guide to interpreting the IPA symbols, but you can also find videos online that tell you how to say each of the IPA letter sounds., Try to find a mix of more and less formal writing, so you can get a sense of both formal and conversational English.If there is an English newspaper available in your area, pick one up every day and read through it. This will give you a source for learning new words and common sentence structures on a daily basis. Also try reading novels in English. If you find that novels are challenging, try finding books meant for children or young adults, then build up to more complex works. Circle words that are unfamiliar, look them up, and write the definition in the margins of the paper or book. Then try to use a few of the new words in English conversation.  English news reports are a great way to begin exposing yourself to English because reporters frequently speak clearly without any significant accent.However, diversifying the types of English videos you watch can help you develop fluency in conversational English so that you do not sound overly formal or stiff in your speech.Watch movies. Movies that are directed towards children or teens may have less complex vocabulary and sentence structures and may be easier if you are just developing proficiency.TV shows may be a good option as well because they are shorter than movies and can give you a sense of comic timing and humor, which can be part of fluency as well. Turn on subtitles for anything you watch if they are available. Watching the words while you hear them can improve your pronunciation and vocabulary.  YouTube and other video streaming sites have a nearly endless supply of videos in English. If you wish to improve your work-related English fluency, be sure to watch videos in your specific field so that you can master the vocabulary and details unique to your professional needs.  You need to practice speaking English to build fluency, so having a friend who is also learning English will give you both the opportunity to learn and practice together.Alternatively, you could try to find a native English speaker who wishes to learn your native language and work out an exchange deal (see below).  Having access to a dictionary that offers clear definitions of unfamiliar words can help you understand words and figure out how to use them in the appropriate context.Most dictionaries will provide the word, a pronunciation guide, a definition, and the plural form of the word, which can usually be made by adding an –s, but can also take on unusual form such as –es, -en, or changing the vowel from –us to –a, depending upon the origin of the word.  

take a class.  get a translation dictionary.  expand your vocabulary.  check your local library for books or classes.  find an ipa dictionary.  read different types of english writing.  watch a diverse array of english programming.  view videos online.  find an english learning buddy.  get a quality english dictionary. 

 If your baby prefers the other parent, try to play with them more. Instead of putting them in a walker or playpen, or trying to get them to play alone, get down on the floor and play a game with them. Let the child lead the playing, and follow along with them.If your child resists playing with you, then you might want to try getting down on the ground a few feet away from them and just playing alone. Try playing with some Legos or get out a bottle of bubbles and start blowing them. After a little while, your child may approach you and start playing with you. If your child is older, watch them as they play and ask if you can join. You may say something like, “That tea party looks really fun. Can I join?” or “I love swinging. Can I swing, too?”  , No matter if your child is a baby or a toddler, you can take them with you when you do things. Make them your little helper. Babies will enjoy the stimulation of the new environment you have taken them to, and toddlers will enjoy helping you do grown up things.For example, you may carry your baby to the mailbox or put them in the stroller when you walk the dog. Your toddler may enjoy helping you separate laundry or take out the trash.  To help your child warm up to the other parent, let them take a hand in some of the parenting tasks. Let the other parent do things your child really loves, like playing games, reading stories, or eating snacks.This helps the child connect the things they love with the other parent.  If your child doesn’t prefer you, bond with them by doing something new with them. This may be helping your child move to solid food, looking at flowers in the spring, going to a museum or science center, or learning a new game.Make sure to talk to your child during these activities. The idea is to do something together you both will enjoy and that will help you bond.  

play with your child.  take your child with you.  let the other parent do certain tasks.  do something new with your child. 

 It may be that the co-tenant also is interested in partitioning the property, but you'll never know that unless you talk to them about it. Before you file a lawsuit asking the court to divide the property, talk to the co-owner to find out their position on the issue.Generally speaking, property partitions are either voluntary or compulsory. Voluntary partitions typically have to go through the courts, but that process will be much simpler and quicker. Compulsory partitions, on the other hand, can involve a lengthy and expensive court battle that ends in the forced sale of the property. Particularly if you want a partition in kind, which allows each co-tenant to keep a portion of the property rather than having the property sold and the proceeds divided, you'll be more likely to achieve that result with a voluntary partition. Send a written letter to the co-tenant telling them you want to partition the property and would prefer a voluntary partition. You might remind them that you have the right to partition the property, and a voluntary partition would save both of you a lot of time, effort, and money compared to a compulsory partition. If you're not on very good terms with the co-tenant, you might suggest the two of you use mediation to find a compromise. There are many community mediation programs that can facilitate settlement negotiations fora relatively low fee.  An experienced real estate lawyer can help you navigate the court system and ensure that the transaction is completed as smoothly as possible and that your property rights and interests are ultimately protected.Particularly if any partition will have to be compulsory, there typically will be conditions attached to the judge's partition order. An attorney will anticipate these and can advise you on how to avoid conditions that are unfavorable to you. Keep in mind that although you have a right to partition the property, you don't have the right to dictate how the property will be divided. An experienced real estate lawyer can help you avoid undesirable outcomes such as a forced sale of the property.  To initiate a partition action, you must file a complaint or petition with the clerk of the court located in the same county as the property. The terminology, such as whether the required document is called a "complaint" or a "petition," differs among jurisdictions, but the effect is the same.The document you file asks the judge to divide the property between you and the co-tenant. You can request it be divided in a particular way, although the judge has broad discretion on whether to grant your request. The clerk charges a fee to file your documents, typically several hundred dollars. When you file your action, the clerk issues a notice to be recorded at the county recorder's office where the deed is recorded. Anyone with an interest in the property will know it is the subject of a partition proceeding. This can keep the co-tenant from selling or otherwise transferring the property before the judge decides on the partition.  The co-tenant has a brief period of time, typically less than 30 days, to file an answer or other response with the clerk that states whether they agree with partition of the property. This response will be served on you.If you requested a voluntary partition, the co-tenant typically is not required to file a written response. The co-tenant also may not file a response if they've decided not to fight the action. If the co-tenant does respond, typically it is because they prefer a different division of the property, or object to the property being partitioned at all.  If you asked for a voluntary partition, there may never be a court hearing. However, if the co-tenant objects to the partition the court typically will schedule a hearing in which you both have the opportunity to explain your position to the judge.Keep in mind that the judge has significant discretion over how to rule in a partition case. Once you request a partition, what ultimately happens to the property is left up to the judge. Typically the judge will order appraisals be conducted before the hearing and filed with the court so he or she has a good understanding of what the property is worth. You also typically must file a copy of the deed, mortgage, or any other ownership documents with the court. If you're requesting a split that isn't 50/50, be prepared to explain why you believe you are entitled to a larger portion of the property (or proceeds from the sale thereof) than the co-tenant.  

contact the co-tenant.  consider hiring an attorney.  file your partition action.  receive any response.  attend the court hearing. 

 Most cases of placenta previa are diagnosed during a routine appointment. Whether you have concerns about this condition or not, regular prenatal care is one of the most important aspects of a healthy pregnancy. See your midwife or obstetrician regularly, and do not skip appointments.   Getting regular care means seeing your doctor as soon as you think you're pregnant. After that, your doctor will schedule appointments as needed.; , In general, you should contact your doctor if you have vaginal bleeding at any point in your pregnancy; it can indicate a potential miscarriage or a number of other problems. If you have bright red bleeding (but no pain) at any point from the second trimester onward, it may also be a symptom of placenta previa.Bleeding related to placenta previa can be light or heavy, and it is not necessarily constant; it may stop and then recur. If your bleeding is heavy, it's best to go to the emergency room instead of waiting to hear from your doctor., To confirm the presence of placenta previa, your doctor will order an ultrasound to view the location of your placenta. In some cases, you may need to undergo both an abdominal and a transvaginal ultrasound. Transvaginal ultrasounds are performed by inserting a narrow transducer into your vagina.You may also need an MRI, but that test is not often done., Like bleeding, contractions before your ninth month always merit a visit to your doctor. These contractions might indicate preterm labor or other problems, or they may be a sign of placenta previa.It can be difficult to distinguish between true contractions and the normal Braxton-Hicks contractions that many women notice during pregnancy. Do not feel worried or embarrassed about checking with your doctor to be sure. Generally, the cliché that it’s better to be safe than sorry applies here.  If your doctor diagnoses you with placenta previa, ask for the specifics. There are several different kinds, including a low-lying placenta, a partial placenta previa, and a total placenta previa.A low-lying placenta means that the placenta is attached to the lower part of your uterus but is not covering the cervix. These cases often resolve themselves before delivery; the placenta may move upward as your pregnancy advances.A partial placenta previa means that the placenta is covering part of the cervix, but not all of it. Many of these cases also resolve themselves before delivery.A total placenta previa covers the cervical opening completely, making a normal vaginal delivery unlikely. These cases are much less likely to clear up before delivery., Several factors put you more at risk for this condition. For instance, if you are over 30 or have had a pregnancy before, you are at a higher risk for this condition. Also, if you are having more than one baby or if you have scarring in your uterus, you're at higher risk for placenta previa.It's important to stop smoking while pregnant for a number of reasons, but it also increases your chance of developing this condition., One treatment for placenta previa is just to slow down some. In other words, you'll want to take some of your more strenuous activities off the table. You won't be able to do exercises or many of your normal activities.In addition, you shouldn't travel if you have this condition., If you are not experiencing heavy bleeding, your doctor may prescribe bed rest at home. The specifics may vary depending on your particular case, but in general, bed rest is just like it sounds: you’ll lie down most of the time and sit or stand only when necessary.However, bed rest can cause health risks, including Deep Vein Thrombosis, so it is less commonly recommended than it used to be.If your doctor recommends bed rest, ask her for her rationale or get a second opinion.  Pelvic rest means that you cannot perform activities involving your vaginal area. You can't have sex, douche, or wear a tampon, for instance., If you have a low-lying placenta or a partial placenta previa, the issue may resolve itself. Some women with these mild forms of the condition find that by the time they deliver, the placenta has moved., The biggest risk to your health is the heavy bleeding that can accompany placenta previa. Occasionally, women with placenta previa experience uterine hemorrhages that could potentially be fatal. Whether you are at home or in the hospital, watch for signs of heavy bleeding.If you notice sudden heavy bleeding, it's best to go to the emergency room.  When you have this condition, your doctor will likely limit the time she spends examining you vaginally, as that can exacerbate the condition. In addition, she will use ultrasounds to determine where the baby is over time, and your baby's heartbeat may need to be looked at more closely., While medications will not directly treat the condition, you may be given drugs to prolong the pregnancy (so you don't give birth early), as well as corticosteroids to help your baby's lungs develop if you must give birth early. You may also be given blood transfusions due to blood loss., Because this condition can become severe, you may need to go to the hospital for medical care at any given point. If you start bleeding or your bleeding becomes suddenly heavier, you need to go to the emergency room., If you are bleeding moderately to heavily, your doctor may recommend that you enter the hospital. In the hospital, you will be able to lie down most of the time with medical personnel available if any problem arises., If your bleeding cannot be controlled or if you or your baby show signs of considerable distress, your doctor may need to perform a cesarean section. This step may be necessary even if you are not yet approaching your due date.If you are not bleeding heavily and the placenta is blocking the cervix, you may be able to have a natural birth.However, about 3/4 of women who have this condition in the third trimester are not able to give birth vaginally. Doctors commonly recommend delivering a few weeks early with this condition.If you have had a prior caesarean delivery and have placenta previa, you are at higher risk for a condition called placenta accreta. This is a serious condition in which the placenta does not detach after childbirth. You will need to make sure you deliver in a hospital that is prepared for this situation, including having a well-stocked blood bank., Read up on placenta previa and cesarean section, which may be a necessary consequence of the condition. Feeling more informed may make you feel less anxious and more in control., Talk to your partner or to a trusted friend or relative about any sadness, depression, frustration, worry, or anxiety you may be feeling. It’s natural to experience these feelings when your pregnancy does not go as you anticipated, and it’s vital to get these emotions out into the open.Another option is to join an online support group. Online support groups exist for people with placenta previa and people on bed rest. Consider joining one. These groups can provide much-needed commiseration and suggestions for coping strategies., If you are stuck in bed, either at home or at the hospital, try to make the best of the situation. Be productive in ways that are compatible with bed rest: research and purchase baby supplies online, write thank you notes to people who have sent gifts, and take care of any work-related obligations that you can do from bed. But don’t forget to spend time on the things that will make you feel calmer, happier, or less bored.For instance, you could watch your favorite movies or TV shows, read a good book, play computer or video games, have phone or Skype conversations with friends and family members, challenge someone to a board or card game, or keep a journal or a blog.  Having placenta previa is certainly not ideal, and bed rest can be a challenge. However, with proper treatment, you can expect to have a healthy baby, as most women with this condition do. 

get regular prenatal care.  see your doctor if you notice any vaginal bleeding.  request an ultrasound.  seek help for early contractions.  ask for a specific diagnosis.  know the risk factors.  slow down.  ask your doctor for an explanation if she prescribes bed rest.  follow orders about pelvic rest.  check with your doctor about the severity of your case.  monitor your bleeding.  understand how future doctor's visits will go.  know what drugs may be used.  be ready to get emergency medical care.  consider hospitalization.  have a cesarean section if necessary.  educate yourself.  get support.  make bed rest as pleasant as possible.  don’t panic. 

 Preheat the oven to 160ºC (320ºF) and place a rack in the center position.; , Take 115g (½ cup) salted butter on the cool side of room temperature, workable but not melting. Cut it into small chunks and add to a mixing bowl.Most of the flavor of shortbread comes from butter, so using a fresh, high-quality product can make a big difference. The traditional choice is a European-style butter, which has a little more fat than American-style.If you only have unsalted butter, just add a pinch of salt to the recipe. It won't mix in quite as well since shortbread dough is so dry, but it's not a major problem., The recipe calls for 55g (¼ cup) sugar, but which type you use depends on your preferred texture. The most popular choices are caster sugar, for a sandy texture, or icing sugar, for a smooth, melt-in-your-mouth shortbread.Whichever you choose, add the sugar gradually as you beat it into the butter, until light and fluffy.   This takes about three minutes with an electric mixer's paddle attachment on low speed, or a bit longer by hand.In the U.S. and some other countries, caster sugar is called "superfine", and icing sugar is "powdered" or "confectioner's." You may use granulated sugar, but the recipe sometimes ends up a little gritty.  Sift 130g (1 cup) plain flour and 40g (¼ cup) rice flour together to remove all lumps. Mix this into the butter mixture just long enough for it to form a soft, crack-free dough.If this takes more than six or seven minutes, slowly dribble in water, but no more than 15 mL / 1 tbsp.Electric mixers and food processors can overwork the dough, making it tough. If you use one, keep it on low and finish it by hand.The warmth of your hands helps bind the dough together. Rice flour (also sold as ground rice or rice powder) encourages the signature sandy texture. In a pinch, the shortbread should still turn out fine if you replace it with additional ordinary flour., Let the paper hang over the edges so you can easily remove the shortbread. A single batch of this recipe should fit a 15cm (6 inch) pan.This baking method makes a thick circle of shortbread with a soft center.You can use a special shortbread mold instead to make shortbread with a patterned surface. If you do, dust the mold with icing sugar and place it in the fridge., Press the dough into the pan and pat it flat, minimizing the handling time. If you'd like a smoother surface, cover the dough with plastic wrap and roll over it gently with a pastry roller or a lightweight jar., Cover the pan in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge for fifteen minutes (or even a full hour, if you're a perfectionist).This will improve the texture of the shortbread.  Poke the top of the shortbread with a fork, outlining eight or sixteen wedge-shaped slices on the surface. Poke the surface of each slice in several places as well. Besides looking decorative, these holes allow steam to escape, preventing cracking or bubbling.This wedge shape is a traditional presentation for shortbread, called "petticoat tails.", The shortbread is ready at the very first sign of golden brown at the edge, or even just before. It will take longer to bake in a smaller pan, since the dough is thicker.  Let cool for a few minutes, then transfer out of the pan using parchment paper. Cut into slices while still warm, using a knife or pizza roller. Place slices onto a cooling rack to cool to room temperature, then serve or refrigerate in an airtight container.   Optionally, sprinkle with extra sugar.  Form the dough into a log with your hands, with minimal handling. You'll be slicing this log into rounds, so estimate the size of biscuit you'd like to make.   If your hands are warm, it's best to avoid further handling of the dough. Instead, roll the dough onto parchment paper and cut out rounds with cookie cutters. Dust the rolling pin with icing sugar instead of flour, if you have it., Cover the dough in plastic wrap and place in the fridge. Let chill for at least fifteen minutes, preferably 30 to 60, in order to prevent spreading in the oven., The thickness can be anywhere from 5mm (1/5") for crisp biscuits, to 12mm (nearly 1/2") for chewy, soft-in-the-center rounds.  Poke a fork once or twice into the top of each round. This lets steam escape through the holes instead of bubbling or breaking the shortbread.  Place the rounds on a lined baking tray. Check on them around the 12 minute mark, especially if the round are thin. They are ready when set but still pale, or when pale golden if you prefer them crisp. Remove them immediately if they look brown, since the underside cooks faster than the top.  Transfer to a wire rack and let cool. Sprinkle in sugar before eating for a sweeter, sparkling biscuit.   Pack leftovers in an airtight tub and eat within a couple weeks. 

prepare the oven.  add cool butter to a mixing bowl.  cream the butter and sugar together.  sift in flour and mix into a dough.  line a circular pan with parchment paper.  pat the dough gently into the pan.  chill the dough (recommended).  score dotted lines with a fork.  bake for 35–60 minutes.  cut and let cool.  pat into a log shape.  let chill in the refrigerator.  slice into rounds.  poke the tops with a fork.  bake for about 15 minutes.  let cool before eating. 

 Silver makes a really lovely bell-like ringing sound when it is tapped on, particularly when it is tapped on with another form of metal. If you want to try this out before tapping on your questionable silver, find a United States quarter made before 1965. These were made of 90% silver while US quarters made later than 1964 are made of a copper-nickel alloy. The older quarter will give a high-pitched, clear ringing tone, while the newer quarters will give a dull thump of a sound., If it makes a sound like a bell ringing, you have a real silver coin in your hand. If it's dull, the silver is, most likely, mixed with other metals.  

try the ring test with any coin.  drop your own coin on a flat surface from about six inches above it. 

 Rotating a shape 90 degrees is the same as rotating it 270 degrees clockwise.The convention is that when rotating shapes on a coordinate plane, they rotate counterclockwise, or towards the left.You should assume this, unless it is noted in the problem that you need to rotate clockwise.  For example, if the problem states, “Rotate the shape 90 degrees around the origin,” you can assume you are rotating the shape counterclockwise.   You would complete this problem the same way you complete a problem that asks “Rotate the shape 270 degrees clockwise around the origin.”  You might also see, “Rotate this shape -270 degrees around the origin.”     ; , If these aren’t already provided, determine the coordinates using the graph. Remember that coordinates of points are shown using the (x,y){\displaystyle (x,y)} formula, where x{\displaystyle x} equals the point on the horizontal, or x-axis, and y{\displaystyle y} equals the point on the vertical, or y-axis.  For example, you might have a triangle with points (4, 6), (1, 2), and (1, 8).  The formula is (x,y)→(−y,x){\displaystyle (x,y)\rightarrow (-y,x)}.This formula shows that you are reflecting the shape, then flipping it., Make sure that you keep your x and y-coordinates straight. In this formula, you take the negative of the y value, and then switch the order of the coordinates.  For example, the points (4, 6), (1, 2), and (1, 8) become (-6, 4), (-2, 1), and (-8, 1).  Plot the new vertex points on the plane. Connect your points using a straightedge. The resulting shape shows the original shape rotated 90 degrees around the origin. 

note the corresponding clockwise and counterclockwise rotations.  find the coordinates of the original vertices.  set up the formula for rotating a shape 90 degrees.  plug the coordinates into the formula.  draw the new shape.

 These mixes are the best option against cats that use your garden as a litter box, and are available at most pet stores and on the Internet. Shake the granules or spray the concentration near garden beds that are used as litter boxes.   The cat repellent usually uses predator scents to scare the cat into finding a new territory. Choose a non-toxic formula to reduce risk of hurting pets, children or plants.; , You can find animal deterrent sprinklers online, usually for about $40 to $100 US.   Set the sprinkler in the place where the cat enters the yard, or near places you want to protect. Consider buying more than one sprinkler, if the cats live nearby. Given enough time, a cat may find another way into the yard.  Choose motion activated devices, which are available online for $20 to $40. When a cat jumps into your yard, the device will make an unpleasant sound and detract from the environment.   Humans cannot hear the high-frequency sound, although it will be unpleasant for other types of animals. This solution is best for deterring cats who spend a lot of time in the yard.  

use a cat repellent to prevent cat litter.  buy a motion-activated sprinkler.  invest in ultrasonic devices. 

 Pick a truck or van that is large enough to transport large amounts of scrap metal. If your business focuses on scrapping smaller high tech items, you may be able to use a personal sedan instead.   Protect the inside of your vehicle from possible damage or staining. If renting, make sure the rental company allows for commercial use of the vehicle. Cut down operating costs by choosing a vehicle with good fuel efficiency., You will need a place to sort, disassemble, and store your scrap metal. Depending on how much and what type of items you plan to collect, this could be as small as a storage unit or trailer. If you want a large yard, you'll have to lease or purchase an open space. Either space must be secure to prevent theft and possible liability in the event of an injured trespasser.  Dealing with scrap metal can be dangerous and may subject you to cuts, tetanus, blunt trauma from falling objects, and even possible radioactive or otherwise hazardous waste.   Hardhats should be worn when hauling bulky items or when near stacked metal. Wear thick spill-resistant gloves and boots when working with scrap. Respirators are necessary if hazardous particulates, such as asbestos, may be present. Wear welding goggles when cutting metal. 

purchase or rent a vehicle for your business.  set up an area for your scrap.  invest in protective gear. 

 The best local resources for retro clothing are thrift shops, Salvation Army stores and resale shops.These places also have the lowest prices, but a little digging is usually required to unearth quality items. Don’t be overwhelmed by the massive selection, but be prepared to really dig in. Move boxes around, look under things and pull out clothing from the bottom of the bins. You never know what you might find!   Check the glass cabinets near the registers, as well. These are generally locked, and for good reason – the best things are often in them. Find out from store management how often they replenish their stock and check back frequently., The same is true for antique shops. The selection is often much better and less digging is required to find the good stuff. Unfortunately, you can also expect the price tags to be higher than what you’d find at a thrift shop. If you’re considering making a significant purchase at a boutique, ask the shop assistant to go over the details of the piece with you.   If a garment is very expensive, look for designer tags. If it’s not a designer piece, ask about the price. Don’t make a purchase unless you are completely satisfied with what they have to say.  Look for holes and stains. You can’t expect perfection from used items and signs of wear should be expected. However, don’t let a minor defect stop you from buying a piece you really love. Evaluate any flaws you find realistically. Sometimes garments can be dry cleaned or repaired, but not always.   Think about the size of the defect, where it’s located on the item, and whether or not it’s still wearable if you can’t fix it. In general, the older a garment is, the more fragile the material will be. Moth damage is a risk, especially with natural fibers. Hold pieces up to the light to look for threadbare fabric and holes.  Websites like eBay and Etsy can provide a vast selection of additional items that would be difficult to find in a resale shop. The downside is that you can’t touch the fabric or evaluate the size before you buy something online. Inspect the images closely. If you aren’t satisfied with the provided images, request additional ones from the seller.   Online retailers should provide measurements. Don’t rely on the size identified on the tag.Make sure details are provided about any damages or irregularities. Find out the seller’s return policy and keep that in mind when making decisions. Often, sales are final., Sizes can vary from decade to decade, and also by manufacturer.Because of this, it can be difficult to figure out if something will fit you just by looking at it. Do a little research on basic sizing systems for the eras you’re interested in.   When in doubt, go for pieces that appear slightly too large. These can always be tailored to fit you just right, but there isn’t much you can do with a garment that is too small for you. 

check out thrift stores and charity shops.  shop at dedicated boutiques and antique shops.boutiques that specialize in retro and vintage clothing can be excellent resources for building your wardrobe.  assess the condition of used clothing.always run your hand over the fabrics to check their condition before you make a purchase.  shop for vintage items online.local thrift shops can only offer so much in the form of quality retro pieces.  be aware of sizing differences.the sizing systems for vintage clothing are generally not identical to modern sizing systems. 

 This mixture will be used to stain the paper so that it has a more ‘warn-money’ look. Use about 3 tablespoons of coffee (all though a little more or a little less will not really make too much of a difference.) You can also add a few drops of green food dye to give you paper a more olive-y look.          You can also use tea to dye your fake money. Make a pot of black tea--it doesn’t matter what kind so long as it is black tea. Brew it for a bit longer than you normally would brew drinking tea (so let it sit for five or more minutes.) The extra time will make the tea a bit darker in color.; , Make sure to evenly coat both sides of the paper so that there is a more uniform color throughout your money. However, try to dip the paper as quickly (and evenly) as possible to reduce the chance of potentially ripping the paper because it is too soggy.  Make sure none of the pieces are overlapping (which means you may have to do one piece of paper at a time.) Place the paper and plate in the microwave and heat the paper for 20 seconds. Take it out and test it--if it is still damp, place it back in the microwave for another 20 seconds.          If you would prefer not to use a microwave, you can simply let the paper air dry. Lay the paper out flat on something that you do not mind getting wet (such as on a baking sheet.) You could also hang the paper up on a clothes line.  There are two ways to do this. You can either print out images of currency, or draw them onto the paper yourself. Be aware that while printing images of money will look more realistic, there are certain limitations you must abide by so that you do not break the law. Your printed fake money can only be one-sided and less than three-fourths the size of real currency.          To print your fake money: Place your dyed paper into your printer. Select the image you would like to print and print it out. Know that it must be three-fourths the size of a real dollar. Learn how to resize images on the computer here.   To draw the details: Use real money as a reference. Choose the amount of currency you would like to create and place it in front of you. Trace around a real dollar to create the outline of your fake dollar so that it is the right size. Draw the details of the front of the dollar onto your fake dollar.  Use a scanner to duplicate your drawing or printed-out money. Make sure to load the scanner/printer with your dyed pieces of paper.          If you forget to load the printer with your dyed paper, you can dye the paper you printed your images on by dipping them back in the coffee mixture and putting them in the microwave again. Be aware that the ink used to make the details of the money may run if you do this.  Now that you have multiple bills, cut them out with scissors. You could also use a paper cutter to ensure that your bills are all cut the same size and that the cuts are straight.  Only do this if you are wanting to create a stack of fake bills. You can purchase cash straps at office supply stores or banks. If you do not want to buy them, you can use thick rubber bands. Write the name of a fake bank (or a real one even) on the wide rubber band.         

mix water and coffee in a bowl or pan.  dip the pieces of printer paper into the water.  place the pieces of paper on a microwave-safe plate.  make your fake money.  create multiple copies.  cut your bills out.  add a band around the bills. 

 Stand up straight, keep your shoulders back and hold your head up.; ,   Be kind and do nice things for others-when people compliment you and thank you, you'll feel better about yourself. Let your feelings out by writing in a diary. Let the past be the past. Forgive yourself! Everyone makes mistakes, and you deserve a fresh beginning. Learn to forgive others, and learn to forgive yourself. Say out loud, 'I forgive myself for _________." It'll make you feel better and help keep it out of your mind. Put positive statements where you will see them everyday: "I am beautiful" or "I have a lot of courage" on your mirror or your refrigerator. Don't define yourself by what you have or haven't done. Celebrate accomplishments, certainly, but don't put yourself done because you haven't done this or that. Be who you really are, and trust yourself! Give yourself hugs. Sounds cheesy, but it works. Do what you love and indulge yourself. Know how to say no to people. Treat yourself like your very best friend. Don't compare to others, and accept yourself the way you are.  But only a little. You'll want to use casual makeup such as bronzer, blush, eyeshadow, and mascara.  Nobody wants a girl who is all up in their face. However, never be too much of a pushover.  If you are super mature, wear a bold red ruffle skirt, and a black tank top tucked in to your skirt. You can use any colour, depending on how mature you are.  Have mature friends, that respect you, and think that all of them, and you, are mature.  Maturity is part of growing up. Embrace it!  

have good posture.  feel proud and love yourself.  put on makeup.  be tough, but polite.  dress according to your style and maturity.  make good friends.  have fun! 

 Skateboarding is a very dangerous sport, and you can really get hurt. Always wear a helmet and if you're just starting out or you feel insecure, wear padding.; , There's no way you can be a skater, if you don't skate. Then you'd just be a poser. Go to a skate shop and get the clerk to help you get the right stuff.  A big part of becoming the style of a skater, is seeing if you have it or not. Skaters are usually very extroverted and don't care what people think of them. But, you can also be skater if you are an ambivert and moshing.  Yes, there is music that can be seen as skater. You can mix in hip-hop, rap, rock, Metalcore, metal, indie, emo, punk, punk pop, and old stuff together. Try bands like Green Day, Rancid, Linkin Park, and other music like that. Most of the stuff you already listen to could be considered skater, so if you like it, listen to it.  Every subculture has its own style of speaking. So try out these words and see if they fit.   Dude  A male.  "Dude, did you see that?"     Chick  A female.  "Did you see that chick?"     Rad  Awesome or cool.  "Dude, that was rad!"     Sweet  Awesome or cool.  "That was a sweet trick."     Sick  Awesome or cool.  "I heard the half pipe there was real sick."     Sketchy  A skateboarding trick that is not landed nicely or not landed at all. Not good, example: a dark man calling you into an alley.  "That trick was sketchy." "Did you see that sketchy guy by the corner store?"     Shady  Same as sketchy.  "Man, he was shady..."     Clean  The opposite of "sketchy" and "shady".  "That was a clean landing."      , Now that you've hopefully gotten into the part that counts, try dressing like a skater. Some good brands include 'Etnies', Element, DC, Circa, Quicksilver, Billabong, Vans, and Zoo York. You don't always have to have brand name things, though. Even second hand shops like Goodwill and Value Village have some nice things.   Pants       You can wear them tight or baggy, depending on what you like. Rips are really good, and they scream, "I can skate." Just don't make them yourself. Actually try skating and ripping them from shredding an awesome trick. Graffiti pants. Write, write, write all over your pants. Make sure you only do this to 1 or 2 of your pants. Skater shorts. If it's hot out, wear shorts with pockets. Cargo pants/shorts are nice, too.   Shirts       Any shirt is really good, doesn't matter if it's tight or baggy... Just don't match baggy things up too much, or you end up looking like a gangster.   Shoes       Skater shoes. These are usually the only shoes skaters wear, because they have flat bottoms and can grip to the board. Try DC, Vans, Fallen or DVS .   Hair  Any color of hair usually works if it's long. Lots of skaters have curly hair, so don't bother buying a straightener unless you want to. Many skaters also have straight or wavy hair. Just go natural, man.   Hats  Flat brimmed hats usually end up making your head look wide and flat. Any hat will really work, but only if it's a ball cap or toque. You don't see skaters walking around in cowboy hats and boas.   Belts  Skaters always wear belts to keep their pants from falling down when they are skateboarding. Shoelaces always work. Can't have the other skaters at the skate park seeing those underpants.  It's time to see what you do about those put-downs. If someone calls your skating crappy or calls you a poser, try not to care. Most of them probably just think your style is too rad for them.  A lot of people at the skate park make fun of each other, but they are usually friends. If you go around making fun of everyone, you won't have any friends after a few months, and everyone will think of you as a jerk. Remember, never call anyone on a board a poser, no matter how bad they are. They're probably just beginning. You can't be a poser if you're trying!  

decide if you really want to be a skater.  get a board.  see if you have it inside.  listen to the music.  learn the language.  dress the part.  put-downs.  your put-downs. 

 Before you go to bed, decide what you will wear tomorrow. This will keep you from digging through your closet, trying on a bunch of clothes, and making a mess. Once you make a choice, lay out the shoes, accessories, and anything else you plan to wear.   Check the weather and your schedule to make sure your outfit is appropriate. Do you have an important meeting the next day? Is it going to be hot and humid or rainy?; , Sleep is important for your mental and physical health. Try to get between 7 and 9 hours of sleep each night. While you are sleeping, blood flow to your skin increases. Adequate sleep will keep your eyes from being puffy and keep you from waking up with dull skin.It's important for you to develop a regular sleeping schedule. Over time, not getting enough sleep causes your skin to age and makes you more prone to wrinkles.Sleep on a silk or satin pillowcase. These materials are less drying for your skin and will keep you from waking up with creases on your face.Some people may need more than 9 hours of sleep of night or less than 7 hours of sleep a night. Adjust the time based on your needs and how you feel when you wake up in the morning. Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine because they can keep you awake or disrupt your natural sleep cycle.Try not to nap too close to your bedtime or you will have difficulty falling and staying asleep.  Your skin is comprised primarily of water and needs to be hydrated from both the inside and outside. If you do not drink enough water, your skin can become dry and flaky. Aim for 8 glasses of water a day to keep your skin hydrated and looking healthy.Moisturize your skin after a bath, shower, and when you wash your hands.Your skin absorbs moisture best when it is damp.  Always wash your face before you go to bed.During the day, your skin is exposed to pollution, dirt, sweat, and bacteria.Washing your face at night will remove all of the day's gunk from your face. Going to bed with a dirty face can cause an acne breakoutand leave you with dull looking skin in the morning.   Everyone should wash their face at night, but this is particularly important if you wear makeup. Sleeping in makeup can clog your pores and lead to breakouts.  Nighttime is a great time to moisturize your skin. Although you are sleeping, your body is still working to repair your tissues. The increased blood flow you experience when you sleep helps your skin better absorb the moisture that you apply to your skin.This is the time to use heavier, thicker moisturizers. Moisturizers are best when applied to clean, slightly damp skin. Try to do this after you bathe and wash your face for the night.  Sleeping in a bun is good way to have good hair day when you wake up. If you have longer hair, put your hair in a ponytail and wrap it into a twist. When you wake up in the morning, you will have soft waves in your hair. If your hair is not long enough for one ponytail, try doing little mini-buns all over your head for the same effect.   Tie the ponytails loosely to prevent creases in your hair.If you shower at night, you can braid your wet hair to add some texture. You can also wash your hair at night and apply dry shampoo in the morning if you have oily hair. If you are prone to frizzy hair, wrap your hair with a silk scarf or sleep on a silk pillowcase.  Set your alarm and give yourself enough time to go through your morning routine. If you are not sure how long it will take you to get ready, time yourself one weekend morning. Once you know how long it will take you, you can set your alarm for a good time during the week.   If you go to bed at a decent time, it will be easier for you to wake up at the time you need to.  Eating a healthy breakfast can get your day off to a good start and fuel your body. Your breakfast should be a combination of whole grains, lean protein, low-fat dairy, and fruits and vegetables.Part of looking good is having plenty of energy and getting the necessary vitamins and minerals your body needs.   Good breakfast options include: oatmeal with almonds or dried fruit, fruit and vegetable smoothie, multi-grain pancakes with fruit and yogurt, whole-grain waffle/bread with peanut butter, or an egg omelet with vegetables.Drink plenty of water as part of your breakfast. If you are rushed for time in the morning, prep your breakfast ingredients the night before.  Healthy, clean skin will have a nice glow and help you look refreshed. Wash your face with a gentle cleanser and moisturize your face in the morning.You should also apply sunscreen before you leave for the day. Use sunscreen that is at least SPF 30.Use a lighter moisturizer than you used at night. You can also try a tinted moisturizer to give your skin a nice glow and a more even tone.  Apply a cold compress to your eyes to get rid of dark circles and puffiness. A cold spoon or a bag of frozen peas can be used as a compress.To further reduce puffiness, sleep with your head elevated to prevent fluid from pooling under your eyes.Place the spoon in the refrigerator instead of the freezer so it will not be too cold. You can put the spoon in the fridge the night before. Wrap the frozen peas in a cloth before applying to your face. If the cold compress doesn't work, apply a concealer with yellow undertones to hide dark circles under your eyes.Used tea bags can also be used to reduce puffiness. Steep your tea bags in hot water, allow them to cool a little, squeeze out excess liquid and then apply to your eye area., It might be difficult, but try to exercise in the morning. Exercise increases blood flow, releases feel good hormones, and gives you a nice glow.If you can, get in 30 minutes of exercise, but even a brisk 10 minute walk can get the blood flowing.   Exercise will improve your mood and give you more energy for the day.  

pick out your outfit.  get enough sleep.  stay hydrated.  wash your face.  moisturize your skin.  prep your hair.  wake up early enough.  eat breakfast.  take care of your skin.  get rid of puffy eyes and dark circles.  try to exercise. 

 Look for paper that’s one single color to use as the base part of your card. Then try to find some patterned scrapbook paper that compliments the color of your card. Find out what your mom’s favorite color is if you don’t already know. Try to get some paper in this color as an added gesture. You can also use ribbons if you wish.  Fold your thick piece of cardstock in half to make your card. Then cut strips of your scrapbook paper to adhere to the cardstock.   You can cut the strips at different widths so that you can layer each one over the last one. This will give a nice texture and look to the card.  To finish the outside of your card, add something like a ribbon with a bow on it or a little message to your mom. You can also write something like “To Mom” with a fine-point marker and then punch holes through it with a pin to add even more texture and variety. Small gems can also be an added touch that ties the card together. , On the inside write your mom a nice message showing her how much you care.   If you’re feeling really creative, you can even write her a poem.  

get some textured cardstock and scrapbook paper.  glue the different pieces of paper together.  add a ribbon or a small stamped message to the front.  write her a nice note or poem. 

 Peel two or three garlic cloves and place inside a jar. Cover with organic olive oil and allow to sit in a cool dry spot on your home for up to 24 hours. Add a few drops of the mixture to your dog’s food to boost immunity.  Drizzle one to two teaspoons of coconut oil over the dog food, depending upon your dog’s weight and age.  Not only soothing, raw honey has antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties that will help your dog’s cough heal quicker.  While many of these remedies can be useful, check with your vet first before administering any homeopathic or herbal medications.   Use Drosera for an extremely dry, hacking cough that becomes violent or out of control. Administer Aconite when kennel cough symptoms initially appear. This may reduce the severity of the cough. Dose the pup with Rumex Crispus to quiet that horrible tickle down Fido’s throat. Reduce croupy coughs using Spongia Tosta along with warm broth in the dog’s food.  

infuse pup’s meal with garlic infused olive oil.  add virgin coconut oil to your dog’s dinner to boost overall immunity.  sooth a sore throat with raw honey.  turn to homeopathic remedies as directed by your vet. 

 Measure the circumference around the thickest part of your upper arm, usually at the bicep.  Measure the circumference around your chest at its widest point. For most men this will be at the armpits, for most women this will be at the nipple line.  Measure the circumference around your natural waist and your lower waist (two separate measurements). The natural waist is the smallest point of your waist (unlike where clothes’ waistlines are located these days) and is usually an inch or two above your bellybutton. Your lower waist is the widest part of your waist, usually at the bellybutton or just below, where weight is generally gained first.  Measure the circumference around your hips at the widest point. This will usually be roughly just above the crotch line.  Measure the circumference around your upper thigh at its widest point. This is usually ½ to 3/4’s of the way up your thigh, from the knee.  Measure the circumference around your calf at its widest point, usually roughly ¾ of the way up from the ankle.  For weight monitoring, you may include your body weight as a body measurement. This measurement will need to be taken with a scale, either electronic or manual. You can find scales for sale at many stores, or for use at gyms and doctor’s offices.  The easiest way to measure your height is to stand straight with no shoes on and place your back against a wall. Using a pencil, place the pencil flat against the top of your head with the writing end against the wall. Carefully mark your height against the wall. Step away and measure from the mark down to the floor using any measuring tape.  You may wish to use the above measurements to calculate your body fat or BMI if you are intending to monitor your weight loss. Be aware that body fat calculations are frequently inaccurate or unreliable, though BMI is a fairly accurate way of measuring your weight (unless you are a fit athlete, in which case better not).  

measure your upper arm.  measure your chest.  measure your waist.  measure your hips.  measure your upper thigh.  measure your calves.  measure your weight.  measure your height.  calculate your body fat or bmi. 

 Make sure they are moving in a slight downward motion, don't swing "uppercut". You will achieve it up 90 percent of the time.  That is where the ball will travel fastest off the bat.  You need to see where you need to make contact and where the ball is. Also you need to see the spin of the ball, to know if it will break.  

drive your hands forward.  try to hit the ball on the sweet spot of the bat (a few inches down from the end).  always keep your eye on the ball. 

 When planning your own touching story, it is helpful to think of other touching stories that you’ve read, reflecting on what you liked, what you didn’t like, and what you might have done differently. Without copying them, you can choose specific elements of a variety of touching stories to help shape your own story.Perhaps you’re drawn to stories that have a lot of dialogue and would like to incorporate that into your work. Or, you might not like long, drawn out setting descriptions and may choose to write shorter descriptions. You might find that you really enjoy reading touching stories in which love prevails over an external triumph. That’s a wonderful reflection, as it gives you a potential starting point for your own touching story.; , One engaging feature of a touching story is that it is relatable and readers can imagine and feel what the characters are going through, so you want to think of a situation that many people can relate to. This helps ensure that the maximum number of readers will really get into your touching story. Be creative and don't do something too common; nobody wants to read yet another variation of a story they've read too many times already.Some examples include:   Loss of a loved one or pet Marriage-related situations A big move Finding love Forgiveness Going away to college Getting a new job Going on a journey of self discovery A kind gesture met by another kind gesture  , The most important characters are the protagonist ("hero") and the antagonist ("villain"). However, you will want to add some more minor characters, otherwise, the touching story will not be as interesting. When you are making up characters, write at least some backstory about each of them. Even if you don't put this in the story, it's good to keep in mind so your characters will always act "in character". Figure out what role each person has in the plot.You might have a notebook specifically for character development, dedicating a page to each character in which you jot down notes about them. You don’t have to use every character note that you write down. It’s better to have too much than too little, as you can always cut or revise details later. This is where you can bring your characters to life. Imagine your protagonist. Is she from a small town? How did she end up in the big city? Where did she meet the love of her life who she’ll connect with later in the story? What’s her favorite band? Food? Author?  , Many new authors want to jump right in and write; however, it is better to do some planning beforehand. Making an outline or chart of characters, backstories, conflict, and settings helps ensure that the touching story is consistent and the plot makes sense. This also allows you to fill in any gaps in your story and change points around as necessary.Perhaps the most famous example of plotting a story is J.K. Rowling’s chart for the Harry Potter novels.Notice that she pays attention to details, planning out the action for each month of the story, as well as the plots and subplots. Everything is managed and accounted for in her hand-written spreadsheet. You should refer to your character pages while plotting to maintain consistency.  The setting of your touching story is vitally important, serving as more than a passive backdrop. Instead, characters interact with the setting in this type of story, and the setting can, at times, offer a sort of locomotion that propels the story along. One way to relate to your audience, too, is through setting, making your story even more robust.Think about where you want your story to take place. Imagine the house, the store, the school, the city, the state, the country, and write down details of your location in your notebook. Also consider when this is taking place. Determine what season and time your touching story is set. Does it happen to be during a holiday? Do you imagine this taking place in one location, such as a boat dock as they wave goodbye to one another? Or do you see your story spanning sunrise and sunset both, on a boat dock and at a high school football game?  , Point of view is also important in a touching story as you want your readers to sympathize with the characters. Do you want to tell your touching story from the point of view of one character in particular so that readers become invested in them primarily, or perhaps as a third-person narrator so that readers are paying more equal attention to all of your characters?   A single-character point of view is useful because you can give your readers access to your character’s inner thoughts, their feelings, their reactions, and the story as they experience it. This interior perspective  is useful because readers become invested in that character. On the other hand, if you have a third-person narrator in your story, a narrator that is removed and tells the story to the readers, you are able to describe more characters, but with less emotional depth. You may also incorporate free indirect discourse, which allows readers partial access to a character’s thoughts while maintaining that third-person narrator, Often you won’t know what works best for you until you sit down to write. You might decide that a pen and paper is best, or you may determine that typing on a computer works better for you. Also, you might find that writing in a particular room in your house, or in a chair outside, or at a coffee house inspires creativity. Some research suggests that our writing and retention improve when we write by hand because it slows us down, allowing us to think better., Resist the temptation to name characters, places, and the story itself, initially. Sometimes when people write, they spend too much time coming up with names rather than characterization, plot details, and other vital elements. You can (and should) go back later and work on naming your characters.Although you know your characters fairly well by now, having imagined them, written notes about them, and mapped them into your larger touching story, don’t worry about details right now like names. What’s important at this stage is the substance and to make sure that you’re focusing on writing a touching rather than gimmicky story.  What makes touching stories so effective is that the reader can emotionally connect and relate to the story, setting, characters, and plot. This emotional connection is typically predicated on something very simple, such as love or compassion, so make sure that you don’t overcomplicate or over-sentimentalize your story.For example, while it’s possible that someone has very, very bad luck, most readers won’t emotionally connect to a story in which the protagonist has over-the-top experiences (like being forced to drive a runaway train full of dynamite while trying to save her one, true love). Less is better, allowing the characters and storyline to really shine through.  You can write a deeply touching story that resonates with your audience and not be overly sentimental. In fact, you want to avoid sentimentality, instead recognizing that you can convey thoughts, emotions, struggles, and experiences without over-expressions of emotion. Don’t avoid emotions in your touching story, just avoid excess.You can tell your reader what a character is feeling very directly by just stating it. For example, “Kurt was feeling anxious as he stood on the front porch, staring at the front door that he hadn’t seen in 27 years.” Or you can indirectly offer this by using an adjective to describe a person or a thing (noun), which tells the reader the character’s feelings about that noun, giving an indirect glimpse at their feelings. For example, “Chloe made her way down the busy street, hoping that she’d see Samantha before her horrible boss made her go back to work.”  , Remember, you want your readers to relate to and connect with your touching story and really become emotionally invested, so be intentional with your plot, actions, and characters so that you don’t slip into a sensational or melodramatic story. With a touching story, less is more.Be realistic and you’ll be relatable.   A character may have a sick parent who they are unable to financially care for, which is realistic and relatable. But it would be melodramatic to say that character also has a sick child, missing dog, and that they lost their job. What is one touching aspect of your story that you think your readers could connect with?  , You’ll use style, tone, and vocabulary to manipulate your writing so that your story is touching, authentic, and relatable. Also, consider that your audience and medium of publication will influence the mechanics of your story. Your tone, style, and even your word choices will be different depending on who and what you’re writing for.   Your word choices will impact the mood, tone, and action of your touching story and determine how your reader responds to your touching story.If you want to set a positive tone, for example, you might describe your protagonist as modest, appreciative, cheerful, or benevolent. On the other hand, you might describe your protagonist’s feelings as she searches the woods for her elderly Labrador Retriever one night as frantic, desperate, and terrified.  Readers emotionally resonate with sympathetic characters, making them likable and relatable, both vital to an effective touching story. Just like before, remember that less is more here. Don’t overwhelm your reader with character traits; instead, be judicious with how you portray your character, giving more meaning to that which you do offer.Typically a sympathetic character will face an obstacle, or have a worthwhile or even noble cause, or they may have a passion or love to pursue. These aspects humanize your character and give your reader a reason to root for them.  You want your reader to feel what’s happening in your touching story, and you’ll do this by bringing the characters to life and telling a believable story. Another trick is to make your story emotionally resonant, helping your readers feel what your characters feel.Rather than tell your reader how your character feels, occasionally tell your reader how the character reacts to a situation. What do they do because of how they are feeling? For example, instead of saying, “Jose was devastated when he learned that Anna had married Sam in his absence,” tell the reader what Jose did. “Jose buried his head in the pillow and screamed after learning that Anna had married Sam while he was gone. He cried and yelled into that pillow to exhaustion, finally falling into a disturbed and restless sleep.”  , Write your first draft with the understanding that it will need a lot of work. Refer to your story map frequently as you write, but don’t worry about editing yet. Spend your time and energy generating the first draft of your story, focusing on developing your plot and characterization. #*Editing is another step in the writing process., You can never have too much backstory, even about the most minor characters. Remember that Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Tolkien, and J.K. Rowling all paid attention to backstory and characterization, even for the most minor characters. You need to remember, though, not to overwhelm your reader with too much backstory at one time. You might need to spread out a character’s backstory over several chapters so that it’s not too much at once.If you’re writing a shorter story, you might not have the space to spread out the backstory. In that case, choose the most important details that will help your reader engage emotionally with the characters and storyline.  Touching stories are emotionally complex, and you should allow yourself the opportunity to revise, focusing on different points and areas with each “second look.” Every time you revise your touching story, approach your text with one goal in mind, such as working on character development, or transitions, or dialogue. Working on one area at a time will help you stay focused, not getting sidetracked by other issues that you notice.  Whether you read out loud to yourself, your Aunt Martha, or your cat, reading your story out loud will make you a better writer.Even better is to ask someone to read your story out loud to you. Hearing a story allows you or your readers to access the story in a different way, and will help you identify issues with tone, grammar, and syntax.  While revising, make sure that you have your story saved in more than one space. Accidents happen and you don’t want to run the risk of losing your work. Consider putting all of your drafts on a removable storage device or in cloud storage. And remember, don’t delete your drafts. Save each one and name it appropriately, just in case you want to go back and use or refer to something from a previous version of your work.  Ask someone you trust to read your touching story and give you feedback. They will be able to point out things that you may have forgotten to mention or areas that do not make sense to them. Keep in mind that they may not only have things to say about the story itself; they may have comments about the grammar as well. For example, a sentence that sounds fine to you may actually be worded awkwardly., Whether you would like to be paid for your story or not will dictate what avenue of publication you pursue. If you want to share your work without compensation, there are websites that will allow you to publish your work for free.If you decide that you’d like to be paid for your story, consider sending your story to a publishing company (and some magazines) or self-publish your text., Remember, once something is on the internet, it can never be truly erased, so consider your options before sharing your work digitally. When you sell your story, you’re actually selling the rights to publish your work, not ownership of the story. There are different rules and rights depending on which country you’re in, so make sure to look up what options are available for you. Until you’re certain what route you’d like to pursue, though, don’t share your work digitally with others., Consider if you want to be published in a magazine, or part of an anthology, or perhaps your novel will stand alone. Also, consider if you want an agent or if you’d like to represent yourself in negotiations over your work.You can hire an agent who will do the work of contacting editors and negotiating compensation for you. You can also self-publish, which will require that you cover the cost of the publication. You can represent yourself and contact publishing houses and editors directly.
