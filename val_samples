 You should bring your cat to the vet if you notice the gunk is not going away and your cat’s eyes appear very red, as this could be a symptom of conjunctivitis, or pink eye. You should also bring your cat to the vet if the gunk looks green or yellow and is sticky or smelly, as this could be a sign of a bacterial infection.If you notice your cat is constantly pawing her eye or scratching at it, you should bring her to the vet. She may also tear up a lot and her eyes may appear sensitive to light. These are all possible signs of a cornea or inner eye issue.  Allow your vet to examine your cat’s eyes. She may take a sample of the gunk to test it for bacteria and observe if your cat’s eyes appear very red, inflamed, irritated, or sensitive to light., Your vet will recommend specific treatments based on the type of infection or issue your cat has. Many eye issues can be treated with antibiotic eye ointment or drops that you give your cat for a set period of time. Often, with the right treatment, eye issues heal well in cats.If your cat has conjunctivitis or corneal disorders, your vet may recommend an antibiotic ointment. She may also suggest keeping your cat’s eyes clean on a regular basis. If your cat has a blocked tear duct, she may use plain water or a saline solution to flush out the duct.  

check your cat for signs of an eye infection.  get a diagnosis from the vet.  discuss your treatment options. 

 Perimeter is the outside boundary around a closed geometric figure, and different shapes will require different approaches. If the shape that you want to find the perimeter of is not a closed shape, the perimeter cannot be taken.   If this is the first time you are calculating perimeter, try a rectangle or a square. These regular shapes will make finding the perimeter easier.; , You will use this rectangle as a practice shape and will find its perimeter. Make sure that the opposite sides of your rectangle are the same length., You can do this with a ruler, measuring tape, or by making up your own example. Write down this number by the side it represents so you don't forget its length. As a guided example, imagine that the length of one side of your rectangle is 3 feet.   For small shapes you may want to use centimeters or inches, while feet, meters or miles will work better for larger perimeters. Since the opposite sides of rectangles are equal, you will only have to measure one of each set of opposing sides., You can measure the width with a ruler, measuring tape, or by creating your own example. Write down the value for your width next to the horizontal side of your rectangle it represents.   Continuing with the guided example, imagine that in addition to a length of 3 feet, that the width of your rectangle is 5 feet.  Rectangles have four sides, but the length of opposite sides will be the same.This is also true for your rectangle's width. Add the length and width used in the guided example (3 feet and 5 feet respectively) to the opposite sides of your rectangle.  One a piece of scratch paper, or on the paper you have written the guided example, write: length + length + width + width.   So, for the guided example, you would add 3 + 3 + 5 + 5 to get a perimeter of 16 feet (4.9 m).You can also use the formula 2(length + width) for rectangles, since the length and width values are doubled. In our example you would multiply 2 by 8 to get 16 feet (4.9 m).  Unfortunately, different shapes will require different formula for you to solve for perimeter. In real life examples, you can measure the outside boundary of any closed geometric shape to find its perimeter measurement. But you can also use the following formulas to find the perimeters of other common shapes:   Square: length of any side x 4 Triangle: side 1 + side 2 + side 3 Irregular polygon: add all sides Circle: 2 x π x radius OR π x diameter.The π symbol stands for Pi (pronounced like pie). If you have a π key on your calculator, you can use it to be more accurate when using this formula. If not, you can approximate the value of π as 3.14.The term "radius" refers to the distance between the center of a circle and its outside boundary (perimeter), while "diameter" refers to the length between any two opposite points on the perimeter of a circle that pass through the circle's center., Draw a rectangle or use the same rectangle you drew while finding perimeter. In this guided example, you will be using the height and the width of your rectangle to find the area.   You can use a ruler, measuring tape, or come up with your own example. For the purposes of this guided example, the length and width will be the same as the previous example used to find perimeter: 3 and 5, respectively.  Finding the area inside a perimeter is like dividing that empty space inside your shape into 1 unit by 1 unit squares. The area can be smaller or larger than the perimeter depending on the shape.   You can divide your diagram into one-unit (feet, cm, miles) segments vertically and horizontally if you want to visualize how the area measurement will look.  For the guided example, you will multiply 3 by 5 to get an area of 15 square feet. The unit of measure for area should always be written in square units (square miles, square yards, etc.).   You can write the "square units/units squared" notation shorthand as:  Feet²/ft² Miles²/mi² Kilometers²/km²    , Unfortunately, different geometric shapes will require you to take a different approach to solve for area. You can use the following formulas for finding the area of some common shapes:   Parallelogram: base x height Square: side 1 x side 2 Triangle: ½ x base x height.  Some mathematicians use the notation: A=½bh.   Circle: π x radius²  The term "radius" refers to the distance between the center of a circle and its outside boundary (perimeter), and the raised two (referred to as the "squared" notation) indicates that the value being squared must be multiplied by itself. 

determine the shape you want to measure.  draw a rectangle on a piece of paper.  find the length of one side of your rectangle.  find the width of one side of your rectangle.  write down the correct measurements on the opposing sides of your rectangle.  add all your sides together.  adjust your approach for different shapes.  determine the dimensions of your shape.  understand the true meaning of area.  multiply the length of your rectangle by the width.  change your formula according to shape. 

 Generally, a credit score of 350-629 is considered poor and 630-689 is average. Your options will depend on your credit score, so find that out before you search for credit cards. You can get your score in the following places:Ask a housing counselor or credit counselor to pull your credit score. Look at a current credit card or loan statement. Sometimes, your credit score will be listed there. Use a free website, such as CreditKarma, to get your credit score. Buy your FICO score from myfico.com.; , If you have bad credit, then it’s unlikely you’ll receive offers in the mail. Instead, you should go online to check what kinds of credit cards you qualify for. NerdWallet has a helpful page you can visit.CreditCards.com also has a page with a selection of credit cards for people with bad credit.Look at multiple comparison sites, since some sites only list cards from certain issuers., Some credit cards charge an annual fee just for the pleasure of using the card. However, other credit cards won’t charge an annual fee.There’s rarely a reason to get a card with an annual fee unless that’s the only card you qualify for.   Sometimes, a credit card will have extra perks that make the annual fee worthwhile, such as double rewards.Unfortunately, double rewards are rare if you have bad credit.  Secured cards rarely offer rewards, but some might. For example, the Discover it Secured Card offers a 1% reward rate.This means that for every $100 you spend, you’ll earn back $1.   Check the details of any rewards program. For example, some cards only offer rewards for purchases of certain products (such as gas) or purchases at certain stores. The methods of reimbursement can also differ. Some cards let you reimburse your points for gift cards or for cash. Others will let you apply your points to your balance.  Your APR is the amount of interest you will be charged for carrying a balance. The credit card issuer will set the APR based on your credit score and the type of credit card. Cards with rewards generally have higher APRs.You can check the APR at the issuer’s website. It might also be listed at the comparison site you use.  Your goal might be to slowly increase your credit score. Accordingly, make sure the card issuer reports your payment history to the national credit reporting bureaus. A history of timely payments will increase your score and open the doors to more credit.  Most cards for people with bad credit will be secured. However, a few issuers offer unsecured cards to those with poor credit. For example, Credit One Bank Unsecured Platinum Visa is one unsecured option.Also check how the card is secured. Some issuers require that you have a checking account with them. Your checking account acts as security for your credit card. Whether secured or unsecured, you can expect the credit limit to be low. Because you have bad credit, the issuer won’t trust you to run up big charges.  There should be a link at the comparison site which will take you directly to the credit card issuers application. Provide all information requested and double-check it for accuracy. If you are approved, then review the terms and conditions.  Don’t get a credit card and then leave it in your purse. You should make at least one or two small charges on the card every month.Make sure you have enough cash to pay off the charged amount in full at the end of the month.  High balances can hurt your credit score, so make sure not to rack up charges on your new credit card. If you have other cards with balances, then work to get them paid down as soon as possible.There are many legitimate credit counselors who can help you develop a budget and pay down debt. Find them at your nearest university, credit union, or housing authority.A credit counselor can negotiate with your creditors to get late penalties or fees waived. They might also get a lower interest rate.  If you carry a balance, then you’ll have to pay interest, which will increase your debt load. Paying off in full will help increase your credit score.   Also make timely payments. Payments that are even a few days late can hurt your credit score.Accordingly, set up payment reminders so that you are on time. Many credit card issuers offer text or email reminders.  Many companies claim they can fix your credit score. Unfortunately, there are no quick fixes, and the company is probably stealing your Social Security Number and selling it. Look for the following red flags:tells you not to contact the national credit reporting agencies encourages you to dispute information in your credit report that is accurate advises that you give false information when applying for credit cards insists on payment upfront promises you a “new credit identity”  , Obtain a free copy of your credit report and look to see that all information is accurate. Common mistakes include accounts that aren’t yours or accounts listed inaccurately as in default.Contact the credit reporting agency to dispute these mistakes.  Whenever you apply for credit, the issuer will pull your credit report. This “hard pull” will lower your credit score. Accordingly, you need to avoid applying for more credit if you want to quickly increase your credit score.  You can start with a secured credit card and then ask the issuer to transition you to an unsecured card. It usually takes about a year to build your credit up again. The issuer will review your payment history and your credit score to see if you qualify. After you transition, your security deposit will be refunded. 

find your credit score.  search online for offers.  check the annual fee.  research the rewards rate.  check the apr.  confirm the issuer reports to the credit reporting bureaus.  identify whether the card is secured or unsecured.  apply for the card.  use the card.  keep your balances low.  pay off the balance in full each month.  avoid “quick fix” credit repair companies.  fix errors on your credit report.  avoid applying for more cards.  ask for an unsecured card. 

 If you are a strong swimmer, you can become a certified lifeguard and work at a pool, water park or beach. In order to get your certification, you can find your local Red Cross center, and take a lifeguard training class. Here are some of the requirements to become a lifeguard:Be at least 15 years of ageBe able to tread water for two minutesBe able to dive to a depth of seven to ten feet, Busy families who don't have enough time for yard work are always eager to hire helping hands. If you like spending time outdoors, and are up for manual labor, make some flyers, and put them out around your neighborhood. Only advertise for outside work that you feel comfortable doing. Consider doing the following:   Try planting flowers in the spring. Try mowing lawns in the summer. Try raking leaves in the fall. Try shoveling snow from your neighbors' sidewalks and driveways in the winter.  Make a poster that says, "Carwash!", and include the price you will charge. Stand near a street that gets decent traffic, and wait for cars to come to you. You can have the cars pull into your driveway, and wash the cars there. If you have a vacuum, offer car detailing to make even more money.  

work as a lifeguard.  do yard work for your neighbors.  hold a car wash with your friends. 

 Tortoiseshell/patched tabbies typically have tabby markings combined with another type of coat pattern. Tortoiseshell tabbies may exhibit any of the primary four tabby markings as the tabby component of his coat., Your cat is a tortoiseshell tabby if its coat has hair that is definitely ginger in addition to brown tabby spots or stripes., The telltale tabby markings are typically most prominent on the legs and head of a tortoiseshell tabby cat. 

notice blended characteristics.  look for hints of brown and red tabby combined.  observe the legs and head. 

 You usually know what your class is going to be about because your teacher assigned you some kind of material ahead of time. As you are getting to class, think about what you will be covering that day, mentally preparing yourself for the time ahead. This process will get you in the right frame of mind and help you absorb information better., If you're in high school, you really don't have the option not to show up, but in college, you're in charge of your own time. One of the easiest ways to earn good grades without studying much is to show up to your classes and listen to what your teacher has to say. That means not just showing up but being attentive as well.In addition, many professors will make attendance and participation a part of your grade. Therefore, just attending will contribute to you making better grades. If you don't show up enough, you lose those points., It may be tempting to sit in the back row, out of sight and mind of your professor. However, you'll be better able to see what your professor is writing on the board at the front, and you'll be able to hear her better. You'll also be less tempted to let your mind wander.  If you're confused about something, don't be afraid to ask a question. Your teacher will be happy to shed some light on what's confusing you, and other students will likely have the same question.  It may sound difficult to do, especially if the subject is something you don't like, such as math. However, start out by feigning interest, if you have to. Psych yourself up, saying how much you love math. Try to find parts of it that do interest you, even if it's a small part. Being interested in what you're learning helps you to take in information more effectively., Your teacher will likely clue you in to what's important by writing main ideas on the board or emphasizing it with her voice. She may even repeat the main ideas to make sure the class is understanding what's important. Constantly be asking yourself what the main ideas and main points are, so that you are using your time in class to think about and absorb the ideas., Taking good notes does not mean writing down every word your teacher says. In fact, that often means you aren't absorbing the information, just re-writing it on the page. You also won't be able to keep up, unless you are taking notes on a computer and can type very fast. Therefore, it's best to write down notes with a few words or short sentences that capture the main points.For instance, if your teacher says, "We're talking about verbs today. Verbs are the action of the sentence. There are two main types of verbs, being and action verbs." You could write: "Verbs: action of sentence. 2 types: being, action." It's a good idea to use shorthand or abbreviations to make your writing faster, but be sure to be consistent so that you always know what you wrote.Though you can capture more with a computer, studies have shown that taking notes by hand actually helps you learn more than taking notes on a computer., It's tempting to stop being interested if the room is too hot or people are talking. Maybe the day is really nice outside, or you just don't feel like being there. Commit yourself to paying attention. Block out what's distracting you, and focus only on what the teacher is saying and the class discussion.Everybody's mind wanders sometime. When you find yourself drifting away, bring your focus back to what your teacher is saying. If you absolutely cannot focus or you find yourself going to sleep, try going to the bathroom for a short break to splash water on your face, if your teacher will let you.  If you hand-wrote your notes, try typing your notes when you get back home. Typing them will reinforce the information in your brain, helping it to stick for longer. If you typed your notes in class, try re-reading them when you get back home. 

think about the material before you come to class.  go to class.  sit in the front row.  ask questions.  be interested.  always look for the main points.  take good notes.  don't get distracted.  type or review your notes after class. 

 Review the various degree programs you have located and choose the one that will best help you in the career of your choice. When choosing your degree/career:   Consider your natural talents and abilities. Are there things that you instinctively understand, such as poetry or medical terminology? Do you have any skills or natural abilities that would help you in a certain field? Think about the type of work that you would enjoy. For example, if you don't like being outdoors much, a career studying plants or animals may not be the best choice for you. On the other hand, laboratory work might be just the thing you'd love. Identify degree programs that will help you get the type of work you can be passionate about. If you love to read and value books, for example, a degree in the library field may be the best choice for you.  

decide what degree to get. 

 Does it matter whether your new dinnerware matches your old stuff? If so, you'll need to coordinate by material, color, or pattern. Unless you hate your current pieces, consider how you're going to keep on using them., For example, do you plan to use these dishes outdoors on a regular basis? If so, you may want to look into less common but unbreakable materials, such as metal or laminate. If you'll only use a formal set during the holidays, you might want to coordinate with festive colors., Dinnerware often comes in 5-piece (formal) and 4-piece (casual) sets. Consider whether you want all your dishes to match this way, as most retailers now offer dinnerware “open stock,” meaning that you can purchase individual pieces rather than sets. If you wish, you can mix and match different colors, patterns, textures and shapes.  It's probably not necessary to have a complete set of each, although it may be traditional. In theory, casual dinnerware is sturdy and designed for everyday use, while formal dinnerware is more delicate, but there's a lot of overlap here. If you find a good pattern, you might well be able to purchase a single durable, elegant set., Formal dinnerware is commonly made with bone china and porcelain; casual pieces may also be stoneware or earthenware.Porcelain is the hardest ceramic; bone china is nearly as strong because it is fortified by ox-bone ash. Both types are relatively expensive, and are often not ideal for dishwasher or microwave use because they are harder to replace. Many manufacturers now offer dishwasher-, microwave-, and oven-safe bone china and porcelain. Casual dinnerware should be sturdy, dishwasher-safe, and microwaveable; ideally, it should also be oven-safe to 400-500F. Such pieces are traditionally most often made of stoneware or earthenware (cream ware, majolica, faience, delft), which are less sturdy and less expensive than bone china or porcelain. However, porcelain and inexpensive bone china casual dinnerware is becoming quite common.  Plain white dinnerware is always very popular, because it's dishwasher safe, doesn't fade, matches most décor, showcases food well, and never goes out of style. However, you can also coordinate with your dining room or kitchen by picking a color. Dishware can also be plain or patterned.   If you have a brightly-colored dining room, neutral colors will complement it well. If you have neutral-colored décor, you can incorporate a bright color into your dishes that will bring out other aesthetic accents. When considering patterns, include some plain dinnerware with your patterns so they aren't overwhelming. Note that many patterns are created with decals or transfers and should be hand washed to prevent fading or removal. Gold- or any other metal-lined patterns should not be used in the microwave.  While smooth, round dishes are the most common and versatile, they can get boring. Your collection can be improved dramatically by adding a number of complementary pieces in dramatic shapes and textures. This is also a great time to consider some of the more unusual and dramatic materials and patterns.   For inspiration, look online and in magazines for Japanese table settings, where you'll see a wide range of shapes, colors, and textures used regularly.  While there are approximate standard sizes for most pieces, they do vary a lot.   If you are considering very large plates, be sure to measure the space inside your cabinets and dishwasher: a 12” plate will often not fit into a nominal 12” cabinet, for example. Some people find that large plates encourage overeating, while others find elegance in a plate’s “negative space.”, For serving, you’ll want 2-3 dishes, 2 bowls, 1 covered casserole, 1 cake platter or stand, and 1 coffee/tea service. These dishes do not need to match one another, and are a great place to branch out into dramatic shapes, colors, and textures.  Dinnerware needn’t be extremely pricey, but if you are buying a lot of pieces it will add up quickly. This is not a great place to be cheap, however. You hope to use these dishes every day for many years, so buy something you like and cut costs elsewhere.  Usually, this means 12 servings, which covers a fair-sized party smoothly. If you're on a budget, buy enough for the family and add to your collection later; in that case, be sure to buy pieces that are unlikely to be discontinued, or it can be very difficult to complete the set later.  You’d be surprised how many seemingly reputable department stores and the like have many, many horrible reviews: dishes that took six months to arrive, were broken in shipping, were refused for returns, and so on. If you are registering, be extra-careful: some places are infamous for simply not honoring purchases on registries, and when people complain they just refund the purchaser anonymously to a credit card.  

evaluate your current dinnerware.  define what range of uses your new pieces will have.  decide whether you want sets or not.  decide whether you're looking for casual or formal dinnerware.  choose your material based on durability, price, and intended use.  choose your color scheme based on your needs and your room.  choose shapes and textures, especially for accents.  measure tables and storage spaces in order to choose appropriate sizes.  consider whether you need serving pieces.  determine a budget for your purchases.  select as many settings as the number of people you can imagine hosting for dinner.  research dinnerware retailers thoroughly. 

 Growing the sorghum is the easy part. When the seed heads are developing spray them with an organic insecticide.; , At this point daily test them by pinching a grain between the edge of thumbnail and finger. When the grain is hard and dry you cannot break the grain with your thumbnail, and you should harvest the seed heads lest they begin dropping the grain. Cut the seed heads with garden scissors and lay them out on a table in a protected area not in the dark. A screen porch is ideal. Let them completely dry.  Rub them hard to remove all the grain you can. Imagine you are rolling a candle between your palms with the candle perpendicular to your arms. This is the rolling action used to separate the grain from the seed heads. A small percentage of the grain will stick to the seed head, so just accept the small loss.  Now, your collected sorghum grain will have lots of dust and debris from the blooms and hulls and a small percentage of the grain will still be in the hull. Either on a mildly windy day or using an electric fan drop handfuls of the grain held high about three feet or more into a large container letting the breeze carry away the dust and empty hulls (chaff). You should do this over a large plastic sheet on the ground to prevent waste in case you miscalculate the effect of the wind. It is so pleasing to see the breeze carry away the dust and chaff! You might repeat this process a time or two again. Now you will notice that your remaining problem is to either separate the grain that still has the hull attached or to remove the hulls from that grain. It is not so easy to remove the hulls from that small part of the grain that is not naked, so let's assume you choose the former solution.  For example, a 3 mm (approx. 1/8 in.) mesh works for Dale Sorghum. Soil sieves are available at bonsai hobbyists websites. They are typically 12 inch (30.5 cm) diameter screens. This works well with a properly sized screen mesh though not with 100% effectiveness. You will find that the remaining grain with the hull still attached floats to the surface as you rinse the grain before cooking. Oh, and you cook it similar to brown rice, or you may grind it for a gluten-free flour.  

start the seeds in a rectangular flower pot and transplant the seedlings to your garden so you will have consistent spacing.  as the seed heads turn from green to rusty red, they reach maturity and begin drying.  using a large container about sixteen inches across remove the grain from the seed heads by rolling them hard and vigorously between your palms over the container.  winnow the grain.  final process: to separate out the grain that still has the hull attached use a soil sieve with an appropriate mesh for the sorghum variety and size grain you have. 

 Every lotion is a bit different (that's part of the reason there are so many varieties available in stores) and there is no wrong way to go about making it. For this basic concoction, you'll need:          2-3 tbsp (30-45 g) distilled water (or substitute aloe vera gel) 1/2 cup (4 oz) grapeseed oil (or coconut, jojoba, etc.) 2 tbsp (30 g) beeswax Vitamin E oil or capsule Essential oil(s) (a few drops ought to do it); , Do this slowly -- you don't want to scorch your materials. Patience will result in a better product.          Some schools of thought suggest using a double boiler -- if you have the means, this is a good, safe method of melting.  Place the mixture into a large glass bowl. Don't wait to do this -- if your mixture overcooks, it may not form.          Your pan will clean with soap and water; don't worry. Soak it now to go easy on your scrubbing elbows (or dishwasher).  For a thicker, more butter-like consistency, add less water. Mix with a hand mixer until your scented potion becomes thick.          Rose water is also a good alternative to distilled water, if that matches the scent you are aiming to produce. It's easy to find in grocery stores, too.  It needs time to thicken up and congeal. It does not have to be covered or moved to a cool area -- simply leave it on the counter and walk away.          When adequate time has passed and your lotion has formed, scoop 'er into a glass jar or other lotion-worthy container. Throw a tag on it and wrap it up for a personal, thoughtful gift!  

get together your ingredients.  in a saucepan over low heat, melt together the grapeseed oil, beeswax, and vitamin e oil.  when almost entirely melted, remove from the heat.  add the water or aloe vera gel.  let sit for 15-20 minutes. 

 NSAIDs can reduce the pain and inflammation associated with a tailbone injury. Avoid NSAIDs if you have had gastrointestinal bleeding in the past, are taking a blood thinner, or have a history of kidney disease., The pain from a tailbone injury can be complicated by constipation and difficult bowel movements. Your doctor can recommend a stool softener to alleviate these gastrointestinal symptoms and make bowel movements more comfortable., Sometimes your doctor will suggest a steroid injection in the tailbone region to provide temporary relief from the pain and inflammation resulting from a tailbone injury. Your doctor will decide if this is a good treatment option for you. Steroid injections are usually administered at your medical provider’s office., While your doctor can prescribe narcotic pain medication to alleviate tailbone pain, it is important that you only take these medications if you are experiencing severe pain that is not alleviated with an over the counter NSAID. Narcotic pain medications are highly addictive and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. 

try nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) like ibuprofen or aspirin.  use an over-the-counter stool softener.  get a steroid injection.  only take prescribed pain medication in serious cases. 

 You cannot machine wash or hand wash suede slippers by submerging them. If you spill something on the suede, use a clean towel to blot and wipe at the spill.If the suede is waterproof, then you can use a damp towel to wipe at the spill. If not, stick with a dry towel., If the spill can stain the suede and you know the towel treatment alone will not suffice, then use a suede cleaning kit on the exterior.A suede cleaning kit will come with a stain eraser and a small, stiff suede brush with which to work in the eraser.A suede brush, nail file, or soft-textured sandpaper can also remove mud or scuff marks. This will also return the nap texture to the suede.Once the exterior of the slippers is clean, consider applying a suede-safe waterproofing spray to make cleaning them easier in the future., Baby wipes allow you to scrub out the slippers without wetting the suede. This works for both cotton and fleece-lined interiors.Baby wipes are low in moisture and have a mild detergent.Use a couple of them to work the inside of the slippers until you stop seeing the grime staining them.   You can alternatively dampen a washcloth and dab just a drop or two of wool detergent or another mild soap such as baby shampoo on the washcloth before using it to scrub the soft insides of the slippers., Once cleaned out, use a clean, damp washcloth to wipe out the insides. Remove any leftover detergent. Baby wipes are mild enough that this might not be necessary, but it will be if you use the couple drops of wool detergent or baby shampoo., You do not want to apply heat to suede slippers, so you’ll simply have to give them plenty of time to air dry before you wear them again. Wads of newspaper are actually a great way to absorb moisture without using heat, so you can stuff the insides with balled up newspaper to help dry them out more quickly. 

wipe with a towel.  use a suede cleaning kit.  use a baby wipe on the interior.  use a clean damp washcloth to wipe out the detergent.  allow them to air dry.

 Be sure to begin this meal at least an hour before the fast begins so you will have plenty of time. Avoid overly salty foods, caffeine, and alcohol.; , If you focus on that and not on your stomach, you'll be fine. Remember that this is an important commandment and you will feel much better than how you feel now in the end. Knowing that you have completed this difficult but meaningful requirement is an excellent expression of faith.  It will help you focus on the holiday, and going to a synagogue is very important on Yom Kippur. While going for prayer solely is honored, it also is an easy way to stop thinking about fasting when everyone there is fasting too.  Catching up on some reading will definitely take your mind off of fasting. Reading something related to Judaism or the holiday is preferable and praiseworthy.  They can give you advice. It doesn't matter whether they're Jewish or not; all that matters is that they've fasted. You'll be surprised at what helpful tips you may be given.  It will ease the fast and make you feel wonderful later in the evening when you break the fast.  It's a modern custom that comes from the ceremony of Havdalah which ends holidays and the Sabbath. Sniffing spices acts as if your eating something and can give you a lasting "full" feeling.

 Skin-to-skin contact is the best way to catch scabies. If someone is infected with scabies, avoid close contact with them until they seek treatment.Contact has to be prolonged to pass scabies, so gestures like a handshake will rarely pass scabies to another person. Longer physical contact, such as hugging or sharing a close environment with skin contact, can potentially infect someone. Sexual intercourse is one common way to catch scabies from another person. If you had sexual intercourse with someone infected with scabies, seek treatment immediately.; , Scabies can live for only 48 – 72 hours when not on a person. Keep away from any clothing, blankets, or linens that touched a person infected with scabies.Towels can become infected with scabies, since they are used in close contact with those infected. Avoid handling infected towels without gloves. Linens and bedsheets can also become infected with scabies. Take them off any beds and immediately launder them — this should be done on the first day of treatment. Clothing can also carry scabies. Any clothing that an infected person wore in the last 72 hours can still have mites on them and should be washed.  It's important to clean or quarantine surfaces that may still be carrying scabies. This will help to stop it from spreading to other people.   If possible, wash anything that has come into contact with those infected with scabies. Use the hottest water possible and dry them using the hottest setting. You can also dry clean anything that has come into contact with an infected person. Make sure to tell the dry cleaners, though, so they can take special precautions to avoid a scabies infestation of their own. When you can't wash the material infected with scabies, keep it sealed and away from others. Place infected material in plastic bags that are tightly sealed with as little air as possible in the bag. Keep the bags sealed for at least one week. Items that have not touched your skin for more than one week likely will not need to be washed.  Certain groups or people are more susceptible to being infected with scabies, mostly because they are more likely to have skin-to-skin contact with others, which is the only way that you can catch scabies. If you’re a member of one or more of these groups, be careful and aware of any symptoms of scabies.Children are vulnerable to scabies. They can acquire it from being in communal environments in which scabies is more common. Mothers of young children are very susceptible to scabies. They often catch scabies from their children first before passing it on to others. Sexually active people can also acquire scabies. Scabies is most easily contracted as a result of prolonged skin-to-skin contact. People living in nursing homes or similar environments. The elderly or those living in close quarters can also get scabies because they are in close contact with many people. People in confinement, in places like prison, are also at risk of contracting scabies.  Scabies do not spread in dirty environments; the scabies mite simply wants to stay on human skin. This means that some environments, such as the following, are especially ripe for a scabies infestation:College dormitories are a common place to catch scabies, since so many people are coming into contact with one another and the outside world. Places like a communal bathrooms are somewhere to easily catch scabies. Nursing homes are another place to catch scabies. Since so many people are in close quarters, scabies can easily spread among the residents. Childcare centers can also spread scabies. It’s not because the children are dirty, but rather because one person infected can easily infect others through skin-to-skin contact. Classrooms can also spread scabies, since children are constantly coming and going from the outside and are around one another for long periods of time. Camps are another place to catch scabies. The mixture of a variety of people in close quarters can spread scabies.  While animals may have other ticks or mites, they cannot spread scabies to humans. Skin-to-skin contact with another human is the only way to catch scabies.   For dogs, scabies is called mange. This produces a slight itch on human skin, but goes away quickly.Bring your pet to the doctor if they are exhibiting symptoms of mange such as itching or hair loss. Scabies from dogs will not cause human scabies. If you get scabies, it's from another human, not from your pet even if they have mange.  There are several symptoms of scabies, and they range from minor to extreme. Knowing the symptoms won't necessarily help you avoid catching them, but may help you know if you need to move on to curing them.Itching is a symptom of scabies that persists at night. It is the most common symptom, and can be so intense that it keeps those who are infected awake at night. Many people affected by scabies get a rash. The rash from scabies appears as little bumps, usually in a line, and can look like tiny bites, knots, or even pimples. The rash can be confused with eczema because of their similarities. Sores from scabies are only caused by intense scratching. After the sores have developed, the risk of infection greatly increases. Staph and strep may infect the skin. Thick crusts on the skin can form from a severe type of scabies. These crusts hold hundreds and even thousands of mites, along with their eggs, and greatly increase the itch, as well as making the rash more extreme.  Understand that there are particular areas scabies tend to form, because the mites prefer them over the rest of the body.   Scabies often attack the hands. In particular, they can be found between the fingers and around the nails. Arms are a common place to find scabies infections. The elbows and wrists are particularly vulnerable to infection. Skin covered by clothing is often infected. Most commonly, the belt-line, penis, buttocks and skin surrounding the nipples can become affected; however, anything that clothing or jewelry covers is also a likely place for scabies to develop. In children the spots to watch out for scabies include scalp, face, neck, palms of hands, and soles of feet.  A scabies infection is serious. Additionally, untreated scabies can cause you to pass the infection along to other people with whom you have skin-to-skin contact.If a person has scabies, get them to a dermatologist immediately. Not only can severe cases cause hospitalization, but scabies aren't treatable without medication available by prescription. Creams, such as 5% permethrin cream and lindane lotion, are most commonly prescribed to solve the scabies infection. In more severe cases, such as crusted scabies, an oral medication such as ivermectin may be prescribed. Untreated scabies can continue the infection throughout an at-risk environment. If you think you have scabies, go see a doctor immediately to avoid passing it onto others.  

stay away from skin-to-skin contact with an infected individual.  avoid prolonged contact with a surface containing mites.  wash or isolate any materials infected with scabies thoroughly.  be careful if you’re in a group susceptible to scabies infection.  be aware of your environmental risks for scabies.  realize that animals cannot spread scabies.  identify the symptoms.  look out for particular spots.  get treatment immediately if you have scabies.

Alternately, toast the pine nuts in a pan over low or medium-low heat on a burner. Stir often. Pine nuts burn very easily, making them somewhat finicky to work with. When toasting pine nuts, pay attention closely and move them around often. The difference between perfectly toasted pine nuts and burnt pine nuts is often a matter of seconds.; , Chopping before they are put into the food processor makes a finer ground pesto in the end.  Add the extra virgin olive oil in the spout gradually as the food is being processed.          If you don't have a food processor, you can also use a blender in a pinch. (Pesto will turn out finer and less grainy when using a food processor.)  , Give the food processor one or two more pulses. , Pistou is a french (Provence) variation of pesto made in a similar fashion, except without pine nuts. It consists of basil, garlic, olive oil, and sometimes cheese. Pistou is generally used in vegetable soup.  To the original pesto genovese recipe, add a bit of fresh mint leaves and substitute almonds for pine nuts. The almonds may or may not be toasted.  Red pesto is like traditional pesto, except it has tomato, much less basil, and substitutes almonds again for pine nuts.  This pesto incorporates grilled red bell pepper, black pepper, and sometimes eggplant and ricotta cheese to go along with the basil and tomatoes. It has a distinctly spicy taste to it.  For a very rich, sweeter pesto, combine sun-dried tomatoes along with pine nuts, garlic, and olive oil.

 Vegetarians do not eat meat, including poultry, fish, and shellfish., Like vegetarians, vegans do not eat meat. They also don’t eat any products derived from animals. That includes dairy, eggs, and honey., Knowing the difference between vegetarianism and veganism is important, but you still want to ask your guests about their diet directly. There are different forms of vegetarianism, and some vegetarians don’t eat eggs or foods containing gelatin, so it’s important to inquire before you start making meal preparations., If you’re worried about accommodating your guests’ dietary restrictions, ordering food from a restaurant might be your safest bet. Everyone can order what they want, and most restaurants offer vegetarian options. Your vegan guests might have a harder time finding something to order, so make sure you check with them first and choose a restaurant that will accommodate their needs.  If you’ve decided to cook for your guests, search for some accommodating recipes in a cookbook or online, keeping their dietary restrictions in mind. Researching recipes is particularly helpful if you’re not used to cooking vegan or vegetarian meals. If you’re searching for recipes online, read reviews of recipes beforehand to gauge how easy or difficult they are to make. Make a list of recipes you find, but make sure they sound like something you would also enjoy eating if you’ll be eating it as well.  Don’t just assume that the dishes you’ve found will work. Just because a dish is vegetarian or vegan doesn’t mean your guests will like it. If you’re having a hard time finding a meal to serve, ask your guests for some input. They’ll be happy to tell you their favorite dish and it will make things easier for you.  Hosting vegan and vegetarian guests doesn’t mean you can’t serve meat to your meat-eating visitors. You can make spaghetti and serve it with meatballs and parmesan cheese to your meat-eating guests and serve it without meat or cheese to your vegetarian and vegan guests. This will save you time and the hassle of having to make two completely different meals., Foods like lentils, beans, and tofu make great substitutes for meat because they’re hearty and filling. Add them to the vegetarian or vegan dish you’re preparing to enhance the flavor and make it more satisfying. Make sure to check if your guests like an ingredient before you include it., If some of your guests are meat eaters and you’re cooking dinner, make sure you keep the meat separate from the other ingredients. Some vegetarians and vegans won’t eat food that has been contaminated by meat. That includes food that has touched meat or been cooked in the same pan that was used to cook meat., You don’t want your guests to feel guilty if they can’t eat the snacks you put out for them because they contain meat or animal products. Tortilla chips with salsa or guacamole are an easy, cheap snack that both vegetarians and vegans can eat. You can also serve vegetables with hummus for dipping., This will prevent oil or juice from the meat from mixing with the meat-free dishes., Avoid having everyone grab food from one large plate. This will prevent meat and animal products from touching the food you’ve prepared for your vegetarian and vegan guests., If you’re having vegan guests, make sure you have a dessert option for them if you’re going to serve your other guests dessert. Keep in mind that most traditional desserts contain dairy and eggs so they are not vegan. There are a variety of vegan dessert recipes online, like vegan cheesecake and vegan cookies. Some grocery stores sell vegan desserts if you don’t want to bake., A lot of popular cocktails contain dairy or animal products and are therefore not vegan-friendly. If you’re going to serve drinks to your guests, make sure you have a vegan option available. Some vegans won’t drink wine or beer if it’s been processed with animal products. Most wines and beers don’t say whether they are vegan on the label, but you can look it up online if you’re unsure. 

avoid serving vegetarian guests meat.  avoid serving vegan guests meat or animal products.  ask your guests about their dietary restrictions.  ask your guests if they mind ordering out.  research vegan and vegetarian recipes.  run some recipes by your guests.  cook meat for your meat-eating guests.  use popular meat substitutes in your vegetarian and vegan guests’ food.  use caution when preparing vegetarian or vegan food around meat.  offer your guests a vegetarian or vegan snack.  use separate serving utensils when serving your guests the main course.  serve your guests dinner on individual plates.  prepare a vegan dessert option.  make vegan cocktails. 

 Do they believe times are tough? What do they need right now? What do they most want? How are they responding to the news, to current marketing trends, to sales, promotions and other so-called, incentives? What do they fear most right now? You can glean this information in a number of ways: - interviews / focus groups- surveys (it’s easy to use an online survey tool or you can always go old-school and mail out paper surveys, but expect a low response rate if you don’t offer an incentive for returning the survey). - conversations - ask your sales staff what they hear most often from potential buyers; , What sales strategies are you currently using that are failing miserably? Now that you understand your target’s mindset, you may see reasons why perfectly good ideas are falling flat right now.  This is a basic strategy that works wonders in the realm of online sales(but can be used in any kind of sales situation, from face-to-face to direct mail). How can you create incentives for your buyers? Here are just a few ideas:- discount for buying now- added bonuses / they get more product/service/etc. when they buy now- they could miss out if they wait- pay over time- get something extra (or free) by referring a friend-etc.  Put simply, winners expect success, and act accordingly. But if you believe we’re currently in a soft economy, how can you find evidence to the contrary? Here are a few examples:- the next time you venture out driving, notice how many new cars are on the road- notice any time you have to stand in line to buy anything- Google the phrase “record sales this week” or “success stories”- go any place where luxury items are sold and talk to the sales professionals – the fact is, fashion is on the rise, travel industry sales are up, and people are spending money every day on so-called “luxuries”- notice how many cars are on the road, despite the rising cost of gas.  Motivate your sales staff, lay out the ground rules, and offer a major prize to the top winner. If you can’t afford to offer a trip, electronic items, or other costly incentives, don’t fret; just get creative. Here are some ideas:- VIP parking - First right of refusal for the next three major client leads - Extra paid vacation days- Etc.  You can do this by: expanding an offline business to include online sales; expanding an online business into your local physical market; increasing your marketing or advertising; asking for referrals; creating new complementary products or services; selling and reselling to your existing client base.  

intimately understand your target market.  next, look at what’s not working.  proved incentives for your buyers; give them a reason to buy right now.  cultivate a mindset of success.  create a sales contest.  grow your reach. 

 To claim the skull, you must have begun the campaign level from the beginning and have attempted it on a difficulty of at least Normal. The Sierra 117 campaign level can be accessed from the Campaign option on the main menu.; , You are at the right section when you see a video clip of Johnson being kicked into a prison. There will be a dam there with multiple Covenant units guarding it, including one brute chieftain with a gravity hammer.  If you feel like it, you can finish them all off; you will be able to collect the skull right before you finish the level. In any case, taking out the brute chieftain will help immensely, as he spawns in the area where the ledge to the skull is located.  You will see a ledge on the right of the bridge, directly to the left of where the final pelican lands, with two wires leading to it - jump up onto it. It will have grating along it and run towards the far side of the large building on the opposite side from where you entered the area.  This ledge runs directly left from the first ledge and winds its' way around the building, overlooking the holding cell of Sergeant Johnson and co.  The skull is located in a little nook behind a pillar at the end of the building ledge, almost directly across from where you entered the area with the Arbiter.  That is all there is to it. Check your Xbox 360 gamer score and achievement statistics to see the Iron achievement has been unlocked for 10 gamer score. It is represented by a skull with a hammer on it. You will also be able to use the Iron skull in your campaign games by pressing X in the campaign menu and selecting it. It gives you a x3 campaign score multiplier, but if you die during the level, you return to the start. If you are playing co-op, you only return to the last checkpoint.  

begin the sierra 117 campaign level on halo 3.  play your way through the level until you reach the section where you must rescue sergeant johnson and his team from captivity.  take out as many of the covenant enemies as you can.  move through the area until you reach the bridge over the dam.  jump onto the blocked-off pipes at the end of the ledge and from there onto the building ledge above.  follow the building ledge all the way until its end.  claim the iron skull by pressing the right bunker button on your xbox 360 controller. 

 As an applicant to OCS, you will be asked to select which branch of the army you would like to serve as an officer in. Most active combat branches are eligible for selection, but “special service” branches require candidates to directly contact the head of that branch.   Your branch choice will be considered, but you will ultimately be placed in a branch that the army selects, based on its need for officers.  OCS basic training is different for candidates inside and outside of the military. For those coming from the private sector to OCS, they will be enrolled in a nine week course designed to give them the basic military training they need. Candidates who are already active service members will have completed this step and will not need to complete basic training again., OCS for individuals coming from outside the military is a standard, twelve week course held in Fort Benning, GA. For active service members stationed overseas, the OCS program will not bring you home until you have completed your service. , OCS training is broken down into 2 phases. Phase 1 consists of leadership training, designed to bolster and test your physical and mental toughness in theoretical leadership situations. Phase 2 consists of an evaluation of leadership skills in actual field environment tests. This phase is designed to assess how you react to stress in actual battle environments., During OCS, you will be staying in 2 to 3 person rooms with other candidates and will share facilities, like showers, toilets, and public areas, with other candidates.   Candidates applying for OCS in the infantry branch may be able to get the army to pay to relocate their families to Fort Benning. However, most branches of the army will not cover family relocation costs. While not in practice at this time, OCS may require all OCS candidates, coming from both inside and outside the military, to complete a Basic Officer Leadership Course in the future.  

select a branch.  complete the basic training.  attend ocs.  know the components of ocs.  understand the environment.

 Sheets of nori have a rough side and a smooth side. Place the nori so that the rough side is facing up.   You can find sushi mats and packages of nori at most Asian food markets. You can order both of them online as well (nori is dried and is easily shipped).; , It should evenly cover from the near edge to about an inch from the far edge of the sheet.   Start by placing the ball in the middle of the sheet of nori, and spread it out evenly. Use your fingers to spread the rice onto the nori. Keep your hands wet with a mixture of water and rice vinegar. Do not press or mash the rice, or it will not stick properly when rolling.  Place your ingredients in a line, starting on the near edge of the rice layer. Each ingredient should be in its own line, with each row placed a small space from the one before.Some common maki ingredient combinations:   Basic tuna or salmon roll: These rolls typically just have just tuna or salmon rolled up, without any other ingredients. Ahi roll: Yellowfin, cucumber, daikon, avocado. Shrimp tempura roll: shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber. Phoenix roll: salmon, tuna, crab sticks, avocado, tempura batter (fried). If raw fish is to be used, it is important to use only expertly prepared fish to avoid food poisoning and tapeworm parasites.  Start with the edge that has your first ingredient next to it. Lift the nori and fold it over the first ingredient. Make sure to keep the ingredients in place and that the rice sticks together.  Tuck the front edge of the nori into the roll, and remove the mat as you continue to roll the sushi. Roll slowly so that you ensure that the sushi is coming out even.  You will need to tighten the roll to keep ingredients from falling out when you cut it. Remember to tighten the roll with your sushi mat often, but not too tightly. Roll the sushi roll back and forth in the mat to tighten and seal it.  You can use this time to make your next roll. This waiting period allows the nori to slightly moisten from the rice, which makes it less likely to tear.  The thickness of the slices is determined by the number of ingredients. If you have more ingredients in the roll, the slices should be thinner.  Sushi is best when eaten freshly-made. Avoid refrigerating it for a later date. Experiment with different ingredients until you find your favorite combinations.  

place a sheet of nori on your sushi mat.  spread a ball of sushi rice on top.  start placing your filling ingredients.  hold the edge of the mat with your thumbs.  continue to roll the sushi.  tighten the roll.  allow the roll to sit for a minute before cutting it.  cut the roll into sixths or eighths using a sharp, wet knife.  serve your sushi immediately. 

 Though the BBB is a great resource for accessing detailed information about a business, the BBB has come under some criticism for how much weight the public places on the BBB accreditation process. This is because the BBB accreditation process only requires the submission of an application and fee to the BBB, as well as the business's agreement to adhere to abstract standards such as operating with transparency. Consider BBB accreditation as being more like a club membership, as opposed to being a true certification of business excellence. Though BBB accreditation indicates that a business values its’ relationship with the public, this does not mean that the BBB has conducted a substantial, in-depth, on-site review of the company and its operations.  Unlike the BBB, some companies such as Angie’s List rely on membership fees from consumers and not businesses. As a result, there is less of an incentive for Angie’s List to inflate ratings, or to otherwise act for the benefit of listed businesses. Though all of these companies also rely on business advertisements, using multiple websites to check out a company is a great way to get a clear picture of a business, their practices, and interactions with the public., The BBB provides general information about companies, and sometimes the more specific information gets lost in the bigger picture. Take the time to locate more specialised industry-specific sources that review and provide information about businesses. For example, if you are checking on a computer parts company, consider looking at reviews on PCWorld.com, or other sources related to computers. 

don’t put too much weight on the fact that a company is bbb accredited.  compare information found on the bbb website to information from other consumer-focused business review sites.  consider using industry-specific sources to check on a company. 

 Powdercoating is done with thermoplastic or thermoset polymer powder, and these materials are formulated for bonding with different base metals to give the best results.   See the next section for a detailed discussion of the differences between thermoset and thermoplastic coats. What's good for a car may not be good for a small trinket or decoration.; , It sounds simple, but many people forget this step. The powder coat you apply will adhere to everything (if properly done) on your rig, making sealed surfaces, bearings, clamps, bolts and nuts, etc. useless after blasting., Using bead or abrasive blasting on hard metal, such as cast iron or steel, will remove mill and rust scale, dirt and foreign materials. Chemical solvent cleaning will remove any grease, oil, or paint, and light sanding can be done to finish preparing the surface. Aluminum, magnesium, and other soft alloy metals can be solvent cleaned and wire brushed, or sanded if needed.   For example, you might sand-blast whatever you want to powder coat until it's down to bare metal. This is the first step in the process. If you don't have access to a sandblaster, you can also use a wire wheel, bench-grinder, or even sandpaper. Just as long as you get the material down to bare metal. The next step is to strip the metal of any remaining grime or gunk. You can achieve this by soaking the item in acetone (if the item is small enough) or by wiping it with an acetone-soaked rag.  This is done using a "gun" or compressed air sprayer which electrostatically charges the powder material so that it sticks to the grounded base metal object receiving the coating. These guns are available from various suppliers, and cost as little as $100. For experimental purposes, you can apply the powder to a flat metal surface by dusting it directly on, and spreading it to a thin, even layer.   Make sure you have your electrostatic charge hooked up to whatever part you are coating. The powder you use won't properly adhere unless it's given a charge to hold onto. After applying the coat but before curing, be careful not to brush or blow on the powder coat, as this will cause some of the powder to fall off, leaving you with a less precise coat.  A conventional oven is suitable for this purpose if the metal is small enough to fit, otherwise, an infrared heat lamp or other flame less heat source needs to be used. Normally, the object is heated to 350° to 375° F (175° to 190° C) for about 10 to 15 minutes, and allowed to cool.   You can use a conventional oven to powder coat smaller items. Just be sure that you won't be using the oven to cook food after the powder coating. Once you've used an oven to powder coat, it absolutely should not be used for cooking.  

determine the type of material you are going to powdercoat and then select a suitable powder for the finish.  disassemble all threaded or lubricated interfaces before you begin, including anything you don't want coated.  clean the base metal thoroughly.  apply the powder to the object to be powder coated.  cure the metal at a temperature appropriate for the powder material you use. 

 If you feel your singing voice is awful, it is likely because you’re not using specific parts of your body correctly. To use your body, keep your mouth slack and exhale gently. Keep your mouth flexible and loose. When practicing, use an “Ahh-ah” sound. The first “Ahh” should be slightly higher in pitch and tone than the second.Sing from your diaphragm to project.; , When you push your voice forcefully or strain it, your body will tighten up. This will in turn strain your throat muscles and you will lose much of your tone and air supply. If your voice is being pushed, it will sound out of tune or it will crack and break., Several singers struggle with proper tune and pitch. One way to perfect your pitch and tune is to play notes on the piano and imitate them with your voice., If you’re really struggling with your voice, try this vocal fix. Watch your jaw move as you say “A-E-I-O-U”. Determine what vowels your jaw closes on. It is likely the vowels E and U. Try again, taking care to keep your jaw propped open. Practice singing while keeping your jaw equally open. This may take a lot of practice to perfect but will eventually become natural. Having your mouth open equally on all sounds will help keep a uniform and even voice.If you’re struggling to keep your jaw wide, wedge your fingers or a piece of cork in your mouth and try again. Practice until you no longer need the wedge to keep your mouth open., Vibrato is the way to change pitch in your voice. It allows your singing to be breathy and charismatic. Knowing how to control your vibrato is a good thing, as some contemporary singers, like Ariana, have a small amount of vibrato so having the control is important.Practice vibrato techniques. For example, stand in front of a mirror. Press on your chest with your hands then raise your chest up. Breathe in and exhale, while holding your chest steady. Sing a note and hold it as long as possible without moving your chest. Halfway through, press down with your hands but keep your chest raised to meet the pressure. Relax the back of your neck and keep your jaw open wide as you belt out the note. Imagine the air in your mouth swirling while tucking your chin slightly and keeping your chest raised., There are a number of variables that make up the type of voice you have. The variables that create your singing voice include range, weight, tessitura, timbre, transition points, vocal registers, speech level, and your physical characteristics.Range is determined by the notes that your body is able to produce.Weight refers to whether your voice is light and agile or heavy, rich, and powerful.Tessitura are the notes, or part of your range, that you are most comfortable singing.Timber is what makes your voice unique in terms of quality and texture. Some people may have a more gravelly voice while Ariana does not.Transition points are where you transition from singing from your chest register, to middle, and to your head.Vocal register refers to how long you can extend your notes.Speech level is the range of your speaking voice.Physical characteristics play into your singing voice as some people may have larger lungs and stronger vocal cords., Everyone has their own singing voice because of a number of factors so it is extremely rare to be able to reproduce someone else's voice 100%. Do not be discouraged if you do not sound exactly like Ariana. First, refine your vocal talents then you can emulate her stage presence and performance style.  Ariana is a falsetto singer, which means she sings softly when hitting high notes. This isn’t practical for every singer, but once you find your own vocal range you can sing in tune. Singing in tune is half the battle and will make your voice sound significantly better. Once you’ve found your tune, you can try pairing your voice to Ariana’s music.If you’re struggling to sing in tune, pair up with a piano. Playing basic keys on the piano will allow you to check if your voice is matching the tune of the piano correctly., When singing high notes, think “down”. This means, if you sing high notes imagine your voice has resistance and weight. In contrast, if you were singing a low note, your voice would be light and airy.Add weight to your belly to keep your voice resisted.   Imagine an elevator as your voice. Imagine how as the elevator rises, the counter weight must go down to get the elevator to its height., Imagine a yawn and your soft palate. Your soft palate is located at the back of the roof of your mouth. When your mouth opens to yawn, your soft palate raises. This allows you to project your voice, and sometimes, increase the tune of your vocal range., Falsetto singing, used by Ariana, will add character and depth to your voice. Falsetto is meant to be mostly high pitched, in a soft, quiet voice. Imagine a 3 or 4 year old child singing and try to emulate that with the voice you are projecting.To practice falsetto, sing to the tune of a siren or ambulance. Releasing an “ahhhh” sound to the highest note you can reach without cracking, and coming back down is a great way to practice.Another great way to practice is with the vowels “e” and “o”. These vowel pronunciations are perfect for the soft, child-like singsong voice. Sing them from low to high pitches. 

use your body to sing.  don’t push your voice.  sing in-tune.  use an instant vocal fix.  get natural vibrato.  understand what makes your voice type.  understand that you will not be able to perfectly emulate ariana's voice.  find your tune.  improve your high notes.  add the mechanics of a yawn.  sing in falsetto. 

 Taxis within a certain city often have similar makes/colors. Taxis in New York City, for example, are often yellow so city-goers can see them from a distance. But taxis in Munich are sleek and cream-colored. Generally taxis in London are black, as are taxis in Japan. A unique-looking taxi isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but you may want to check other indicators of authenticity, like a meter or your driver's ID badge., Authorized taxis will usually have a meter for determining the charge. Usually, the meter is located on the cab's hood or in the car, near the driver's seat. Taxis are also often equipped with radios to take calls from dispatchers. If you can't see a meter or a radio, do not get in the car.Sometimes, especially in new car models, taximeters can be hard to spot. If you're not sure, ask your cabbie to point it out.  Taxi drivers are required to carry and display their ID badge in most countries. Their badge should have their name, a recent photo, and the company they work for. In most cases, the ID badge will be visibly hanging inside the video. If this is not the case, ask your driver to see their ID.  Do not enter the car under any circumstances if they refuse., Illegitimate taxi drivers may try to steal from their passengers. Do not put your bags or luggage in the trunk. Instead, ask to keep them on the floor by your feet if there's room. If you're carrying expensive items, make sure you know where they are at all times. 

ask a local what taxis look like in the area.  look for a radio or meter.  check for your driver's id badge.  keep your bags close. 

; , Listen, as it's done when you don't hear anything.  Cashew milk can be stored in the refrigerator for a few days. If the cashews have settled to the bottom, just re-blend it again for a few seconds. 

add the cashews and water to the blender.  blend the mixture for 30 seconds to a minute.  pour the cashew milk in a jug.  finished.  

 Traditionally, making brandy at home was a way to capture and preserve the flavors and fragrances of summer and fall fruits. Pears, apples, grapes, peaches or plums were gathered, processed into wine, then distilled into fruit brandies. If you want to make your own wine, you'll need to gather your fruit and start the fermentation process at least a month before you distill it to make brandy. If you'd prefer to start distilling right away, purchase a few liters of fruit wine and skip to the next section.   Wait until the fruit you want to use is in season, and harvest at the peak of ripeness. For this recipe, you'll need about 3 quarts of fruit, which will yield enough wine to make a small batch of brandy. Harvest and ferment more fruit if you want more brandy. Commercial brandy is usually made from grape juice or crushed grape skins. The resulting distillate is harsh in taste, so it's aged in oak barrels to take off the edge.Brandy made from fruit other than grapes is more suited to making at home, since it doesn't require oak barrel aging.; , Wash it thoroughly, then cut it into slices. There's no need to peel the fruit, but you should remove pits for this recipe.  Place the fruit in the jar, then use a potato masher or another instrument to mash it down. This will help the fermentation process go more quickly.   If you're using berries, which are lower in sugar than other types of fruit, you'll need to add sugar. Line the bottom of the crock with sugar, then add a layer of fruit. Add more sugar, and continue layering until the fruit and sugar have been used up. Use a stone crock large enough to accommodate all of the fruit with a few inches to spare, since the mixture will bubble up during the fermenting process. If you don't have a stone crock, you can use a glass bowl or another thick, heavy container. It should be made of glass or ceramic, not wood or metal.  Dissolve 6 teaspoons of dry yeast in a cup of warm water. Use active dry yeast, not instant yeast, found at any grocery store. Pour the yeast mixture over the fruit and sugar mixture. Add six cups of cold water.  The liquid inside will begin to bubble up during the fermenting process, so you'll need the tray to catch any overflow. Leave the mixture in a cool place for a week.  Uncover the crock and use a clean, long-handled spoon to stir it thoroughly, then place the cover on top. Each week the alcohol content will increase.  At the end of four weeks, pour the wine into glass bottles and cover tightly. You can store the wine for several months to deepen the flavor.  To make brandy at home, you'll need a still small enough to operate on your stove top. A 1 1⁄2 to 2 liter (0.4 to 0.5 US gal) alembic copper still will probably be sufficient for your needs.To find a still, look in local kitchen supplies stores, online, and in secondhand stores. You'll be able to use it to make other spirits in addition to endless batches of brandy.   If you purchase a new or secondhand still, be sure to clean it before using. If you want to experiment with a very small batch of brandy, you can construct a still with a copper tea kettle and plastic tubing. If you find that you enjoy making brandy so much that you'd like to make larger batches, you can upgrade to a 5 gallon (18.9 L) still. Anything larger than this will be too big for home brandy-making.  In addition to your base wine and still, you'll need an array of clean glasses, a ladle, and other supplies to complete the distillation process. Gather the following materials and set them out in a clean workspace within easy reach of the stove:   A Dutch oven or another pot large enough to fit the still inside. This will be filled with water and used as a double boiler of sorts to give you maximum control over the heating of the still. Plenty of glass containers. As the still does its work, you'll need small, clean glass containers to hold what comes out of the pipe. A graduated cup will come in handy if you want to measure exactly how much you have. A sealable large glass jar, for storing the finished brandy. A towel, for wiping up any spills that might occur.  First, fill the Dutch oven with a few inches of water. Put the still inside. Add more water if necessary; it should rise about three quarters of the way up the sides of the still. Set the Dutch oven and still over a gas burner or whatever heat source you're using.   If you're using a large 5 gallon (18.9 L) still, it won't fit inside a Dutch oven, so you'll need to skip this and place the still directly over your heat source.  No matter what size still you're using, leave the top 1/4 of the still empty. When the wine heats up, it can bubble and rise, so it's important not to fill the still all the way.  Place the lid on the still, then connect the tube from the lid to the condenser coil. Place cold water in the condenser and set a glass under the spout to collect the alcohol that flows from it. Different still models will require slightly different assembly, so read the instructions that came with your still carefully. It's vital that you follow the directions that came with the still you have to ensure the distillation process runs smoothly.  When making brandy, you never want to let the contents of the still get too hot; the distillation process should be slow and steady. The wine should come to a good simmer, but not a boil. Start heating the still with a strong flame, and keep it strong until alcohol beings to drip from the spout. If the alcohol begins dripping too quickly, you'll need to turn down the heat. Do not let the alcohol drip faster than 1 drop per second.You'll know the alcohol is going to start flowing soon by touching the copper tube where it enters the water. When it becomes hot, the alcohol is about to flow.The slower the liquid flows from the spout, the better quality your brandy will be.  The first distillate that comes from the still, about 7.5 ml per 1.5 liters (0.4 US gal) of wine, is called the foreshots, and it contains a toxic combination of acetone and methyl alcohol. Measure out the emerging foreshots or take a whiff; when the strong, sharp smell of chemicals abates, it's done flowing. The foreshots should be thrown away; there's nothing drinkable there.  The next liquid to emerge will be the heads, which is a combination of acetone, methyl alcohol, methanol, and ethyl acetate. If you're planning to make a second batch of brandy sometime soon, it might be worth saving the heads, which may be distilled a second time to preserve the "good" ingredients and remove the "bad." It's also fine to simply throw the heads away.   Collect the heads in small glasses. You'll want to be able to save every drop of the hearts - the good stuff - which is coming out next. Collecting the distillate in a big glass increases the chances that everything will get muddled together. Keep smelling the distillate as it flows. The heads will smell better than the foreshots, but not nearly so sweet and pure as the hearts. The heads and foreshots together will comprise the first 30 ml per 1.5 liters (0.4 US gal) of wine.  When the hearts start to come, the smell of the distillate will have hints of the fruit you used to make your wine. You'll smell pear, peach, plum or apple essence without the harshness of acetone. The distillate should be clear, not milky. Continue collecting it in small glasses, monitoring the smell for changes.   Adjust the temperature as necessary. As the distillation process nears its end, you'll need to keep increasing the temperature to achieve the same flow rate. Keep turning it up so that 1 drop per 1-3 seconds continues to flow. Do not overheat the still, and do not let it boil dry.  The last distillate to exit will be the tails, which is less concentrated and less tasty. You'll notice a change in smell; the fruitiness will be gone. It may also look milky. This should be discarded. When the tails comes, turn off the heat.   After the distillation process, it's important to clean your still carefully.  You should have 300 mL of drinkable brandy for every 1.5 liters (0.4 US gal) of wine you distilled. Store the brandy in the jar with a tight lid.  If you smell strong hints of acetone and methyl alcohol in your finished brandy, you can store the jar with a piece of cloth rubber banded over the top to let it breathe for a few days. The unpleasant smell and taste will leave the brandy as the acetone and methyl alcohol evaporate.  If you're not in a hurry to drink your brandy, you can mellow it out a bit by waiting a few months before drinking. Screw the lid on tightly and store it in a cool place for several months. When you open the brandy, it should have a smoother taste than it did when you first distilled it.  It's not commonly done at home, but you can distill the brandy a second time to increase the alcohol content and refine the flavor. However, since doing this makes the distillate very flammable, its not advisable to do so until you have plenty of experience operating your still.  

choose the fruit you want to use.  process the fruit.  mash the fruit in a stone crock or glass jar.  add yeast and water.  place the crock on a tray and cover with a plate.  stir the mixture once a week for four weeks.  bottle the wine.  obtain a still.  ready your other supplies.  situate the still on your heat source.  fill the still 3/4 full with your wine.  put the still together.  heat the distilling pot.  collect the foreshots.  collect the heads.  collect the hearts.  watch for the tails.  pour the hearts into a large glass jar.  smell and taste the brandy.  age the brandy.  consider re-distilling your brandy. 

 First, head over to fists of guthix and train to 13 magic. Buy about 500 fire and mind runes, and a staff of air.; , Try getting 99 hunter, hunting red chins from 80 + and then collecting 100 dragon imps (quite hard i know, but the chins will sell for over 40 mill and imps will sell for about 30+ mill).

 A psychiatrist or family physician can perform an examination and speak with you about why you feel you might need antidepressants to treat your health condition. In most cases, meeting with a psychiatrist is considered ideal since psychiatrists specialize in mental health disorders, have more experience working with antidepressants, and can prescribe the antidepressants that will work best for you.Research local psychiatrists who are covered under your insurance plan and set up an appointment by phone or online. Find a psychiatrist using a site like ZocDoc or Thero.org.; , Providing as many details as possible can give your doctor the insight needed to correctly diagnose your disorder and prescribe the right type of antidepressant. For example, those diagnosed with bipolar disorder may need two different medications to manage manic and depressive phases, but someone with anxiety disorder may need one specific type.  Mention physical symptoms of depression such as insomnia and lack of energy, as well as mental symptoms such as sadness or feelings of helplessness.  Identifying the cause of your stress and depression can help your doctor properly diagnose and treat your condition and prescribe the right type of medication. Be honest with your doctor when asked if there are any stressors in your life.  For instance, perhaps you are in a toxic relationship currently that has caused you to become depressed. Mention this to your doctor.  In most cases, individuals who’ve been experiencing long-term stress are the best candidates for antidepressants. Those experiencing short-term stress or depression due to being separated from a partner or laid off from work may not be considered ideal candidates.  Let them know of any medications that you’re currently on, including vitamins and birth control. This can help your doctor better understand which treatments may or may not work to help improve your condition. For example, inform your doctor of any drugs or medications you’ve taken in an attempt to treat depression, and whether you’ve been exercising more frequently or eating healthier foods to improve your condition.   Some of the drugs you are currently on might also be causing your depression or anxiety and your doctor might prescribe you a new kind to alleviate the symptoms.  After having done some research on different forms of antidepressants, come with some suggestions and questions for your doctor. Tell them what medication you’re interested in and why and ask questions about the side effects of the drug.Find out what antidepressants they typically prescribe and which ones their patients have had the best experiences with.  Most antidepressant medications are only available via prescription and can be obtained from a licensed pharmacist. Before you leave the doctor’s office, make sure your doctor provides you with a prescription for the antidepressant or that someone from the office calls the prescription in for you.  Find out more about the cost of your medication and whether it will be covered by your health insurance provider, if applicable. Certain antidepressants may be more costly than most other types of prescription drugs and many offer generic forms that are much cheaper.  Many commercial drugstore and pharmacy chains are open 24 hours a day, seven days per week so you can fill your prescription and begin treatment immediately. You will likely have to wait a few hours before it is filled.  After you get your prescription, you might have questions for your doctor. Or perhaps you have started taking the medication and something doesn’t feel right. In any of these cases, contact your doctor to ask questions or set up a new appointment if necessary.If they are not in, you can ask to leave a message or email them.  Some doctors are hesitant to write a prescription for an antidepressant, believing that the patient may be able to improve their symptoms through other lifestyle changes. However, if you feel that your depression, anxiety, or other disorder is debilitating, then you can seek a second opinion. Make an appointment with another doctor or psychiatrist in your area to get their medical opinion. 

make an appointment with your healthcare provider.  be specific when describing your symptoms to your doctor.  explain any causes of your stress and depression.  inform your doctor of the duration of the symptoms.  explain any steps you’ve taken to treat your symptoms.  come with suggestions and questions.  obtain the prescription note from your doctor.  take the prescription note to a local pharmacy to have your prescription filled.  follow up with your doctor.  get a second opinion when necessary. 

 For example, if you have red eyes and wear contact lenses, a blood vessel constricting drop may not work. It wouldn't be able to get through the lens to treat your redness.   Most eye drops work by constricting the blood vessels in the eyes. By making the blood vessels smaller, they reduce eye redness. Be careful of using these too much because your eyes may get dependent on them. Eventually if you don't use them, you'll get rebound redness which makes your eyes red just because it is craving the constricting agents.Preservative free eye drops tend to be the most natural for you eyes. They come in single vial uses which makes them very hygienic.; , The best way to choose the right drops is to talk to you a specialist about the cause of your redness. Let him or her diagnose you and choose the best treatment method.   If your redness is due to allergies, look for eye drops with antihistamines. Antihistamines can also cause eye dryness/redness, so you can couple these drops with artificial tears. If you have an infection, see your doctor for prescription eye drops that have antibiotics. Be careful with "bacteria-fighting" eye drops. Many people have an allergic reaction to the preservatives in them. You might make your eyes even worse!  , Cold water will decrease the swelling that causes bloodshot eyes, and will also soothe on your irritated eyes. You can just splash some cold water onto your face.   The most common cause of red eyes is allergies. The body releases histamines that dry the eyes, causing blood vessels to swell.Cold water reduces blood flow to the eyes and treats some of this inflammation.  Using ice is another common and effective way to soothe bloodshot eyes.Ice and freeze packs work the same way cold compresses do, by relieving swelling and reducing the amount of blood flow to the eyes.   If you don't have a freeze-pack, place some ice cubes in a clean washcloth. Hold it over your eyes for 4 to 5 minutes. When using extremely cold products like ice or a freezer-pack, always protect your eyes with a thin cloth towel. This prevents ice burn.  Doctors call this "subconjunctival hemorrhage." In most cases, only one eye will be affected, and you won't feel any pain. The blood vessel should heal itself naturally. It can take anywhere from a few days to two weeks.   This can also occur if you are taking any blood thinners, doing heavy lifting, are constipated, or engaging in any activity that increases pressure to the head. It can also happen if you have a blood disorder. So if it occurs frequently, visit your eye doctor. Blood tests may be needed. See a doctor if you have any pain, or if you have a chronic disease like diabetes.  Speak with your doctor immediately if you think you have pink eye. He or she can prescribe antibiotic eye drops or even oral pills, depending on the cause. Pink eye is contagious, so wash your hands with antibacterial soap, clean contact lenses well, and don't rub your eyes. To make sure you have pink eye, check the following:   The dryness and redness is only in one eye, or at least began for the first few days as one-sided before spreading. You recently had a viral or bacterial infection (i.e. ear infection, cold or flu) You've been around someone who had pink eye recently.  See an eye specialist for a professional opinion on why your eyes are red and irritated. Be able to provide answers to the following questions to help him or her make an accurate diagnosis:   Is this a chronic problem or is this the first occurrence? Do you have any symptoms other than red eyes? How long has this particular occurrence been present? What medications do you take? Include any vitamins or supplements. Do you drink alcohol or use any drugs? Do you have any chronic diseases? What allergies do you suffer from? Have you been under a lot of stress lately? Have you been sleeping enough? Are you eating less, or do you feel dehydrated?  , Studies show that our blinking rate decreases 10-fold when we're staring at screens.Blinking is important to eye health because it keeps our eyes moisturized. Staring at laptops, TV monitors, and other electronic screens can cause your eyes to dry out and redden. If you have to look at screens for extended periods of time, take these precautions:   Consciously remind yourself to blink. Follow the 20-20 rule: every twenty minutes, take a break from your screen and do something else for 20 seconds to a minute. Give your eyes a little breather. Lower the brightness on your screen. Place the screen 20-40 inches away from your eyes., You can still make small adjustments to lessen the burden on your eyes.   Place the screen somewhere it is level with your eyes. You don't want to be looking up or down at the screen. Leave a distance of about 20-40 inches (50-100 cm) between your eyes and the screen. Wear eyewear design to fight eye strain from the glare of light off the screen. If you wear prescription lenses or glasses, ask your eye care expert if the time you spend looking at screens calls for a new prescription. Consider a tint or anti-glare coating to reduce the strain on your eyes.  Smoking also increases your risk for a variety of eye diseases, including cataracts, macular degeneration, uveitis, diabetic retinopathy, and dry eye syndrome. Smoking while pregnant can even cause infant eye disease in an unborn child.   If you're unwilling or unable to quit smoking, make sure to smoke outside to keep your house smoke free. You can also purchase air cleaners to keep your home smoke-free if you smoke indoors.  Drinking too much alcohol dehydrates the body.You lose nutrients important for tear production through increased urination. The combination of dehydration and nutrient loss causes dryness and redness in the eyes.   Use a drink calculator to figure out if you're drinking more alcohol than you should.When drinking alcohol, drink plenty of water to keep yourself hydrated.

Vitamins C, E, and zinc prevent eye problems that arise with age. You can find these vitamins in bell peppers, kale, broccoli, cauliflower, strawberries, oranges, cantaloupe, cabbage, tomatoes, raspberries, celery, and spinach.Vitamins B2 and B6 reduce age-related eye diseases and help prevent cataracts. Eat foods like eggs, fresh vegetables, whole cereals, dairy products, sunflower seeds, and meats like tuna, liver, and turkey. Lutein and zeaxanthin protect the eyes from harmful lights.

You should sleep 7 to 8 hours every night.Getting too little sleep can leave eyes dry and irritated, and also result in problems like eye twitching and bags under the eyes.   Another benefit of sleep is that it allows time for white blood cells to fight harmful pathogens., Allergies are a common cause of dry, red, irritated eyes. Seasonal allergies usually kick in at the beginning of spring, when pollen counts are high. The irritation comes from the body releasing histamines to fight off the allergy. The side effect of histamines is dry, itchy eyes. Buy over-the-counter antihistamines to treat your allergies, and drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.   You may also be allergic to pet dander.

 Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with aluminum foil.   The aluminum foil is not absolutely necessary, but it will help to prevent the baking sheet from burning or becoming slimy.  Place the clams in a bucket and add enough water to cover them. Stir in the cornmeal and salt and let soak as the oven preheats.   Soaking the clams in this manner should loosen the shells.  Combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, lemon zest, pesto, parsley, and olive oil in a bowl. Add half of the clarified butter or melted unsalted butter and mix together until moist.   While the stuffing mix should be moist, it should not be dripping wet or soaked.       Only add the remaining butter if necessary, and do so 1 Tbsp (15 mL) at a time to avoid over-soaking the stuffing mix.  Remove the clams from the water and pry them open with your fingers. Stuff the clams with enough of the stuffing mix to cover the meat completely.   If you cannot open the clams with your fingers, glide a thin, dull knife in between the shell halves and cut around the perimeter until loosened.       Position the stuffed clams on your prepared baking sheet.  Cook the clams in the preheated oven until the stuffing turns golden brown.  Remove the finished clams from the oven and transfer them to a serving platter.  

preheat the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit (177 degrees celsius).  soak the clams.  prepare the stuffing.  stuff each clam.  bake for 12 minutes.  serve hot. 

 Wash your car’s exterior and vacuum the inside. Haul out your junk and clean the trunk. The shinier your car, the more money you can get for it, so think about putting on a coat of wax.Be careful when vacuuming. Depending on your car’s age, the vacuum could pull fabric away from the seats and the interior ceiling.; , Detailing goes beyond merely washing your car. Instead, someone will thoroughly clean your car, inside and out, using a variety of products and tools. When you have a car detailed, you are returning it to show-quality cleanliness.   Shop around to get a good deal. Detailing typically costs around $150.You probably don’t need to do this if your car is a clunker. In that situation, it’s probably best to simply drive it to the dealership and take your chances.  You want to remove dents without painting them, which would reduce your car’s value. Get dents removed by taking the car to a shop. It might only cost around $100.Have your car buffered to eliminate small scratches. If the scratches are larger, it’s probably not worth it to get an entirely new paint job for the car., New bolds are cheap to buy. You can easily replace burnt out bulbs with a screwdriver. Changing your bulbs is a cheap way to increase your car’s trade in value., Did you smoke in your car? Store trash in the trunk? If so, you need to clean out these smells. Get an ozone generator to remove gag-inducing odours., Generally, you shouldn’t spend the money to replace your tires. However, it’s a good deal to buy used tires if your current set has absolutely no tread left., Most guides require that you estimate the condition of your car—excellent, good, fair, or poor. Very few cars are in good condition and almost none are in excellent. Be honest with yourself and examine your car critically. Consider the following:Excellent. The car should be brand new and not have had any paint jobs or bodywork. Both the interior and the engine should be clean.  Good. The car should be rust-free or have minimal rust. The paint job should be shiny, and the interior and exterior should have few apparent defects, such as scratches or dings.  Fair. Your car probably has rust and other defects, though the defects should be repairable. The tires probably also need to be replaced.  Poor. The car has mechanical issues which can’t be repaired, and it probably also has severe rust.  You need to know the car’s value before going into negotiations. There are many websites you can search for the car’s value. Popular websites include Edmunds.com, Autotrader.com, and Kelley Blue Book.Remember to find the car’s “trade” value. This is what you are likely to get from a dealer., You might be able to get a better deal if you have a complete set of maintenance records.Go through your paperwork and see if you can find everything.  To really get a good deal, you need to separate the trade-in from the purchase of your new car. For example, you might want $10,000 for your car, but the dealer offers only $8,000. To make you happy, they can give you $10,000 but then increase the interest rate on your loan.Prevent this from happening by shopping for a car loan before you go to the dealership.   Visit your bank or credit union and ask whether you qualify for a car loan. They will need to pull your credit score and credit history. Take your approval with you when you go to the dealership., Unscrupulous salespeople like to play games. They’ll hold onto your registration and license to try to get you to buy a car. Before heading out, make a copy of your license and registration to give the salesperson, but don’t part with the real things., If you show up at the lot with a completely empty car, you’re sending a signal that you’re ready to buy.Leave some larger personal items in the car.   For example, a student can put some books and notepads in the back seat. If you’re a parent, you can put the child seat in the back along with blankets and toys.  You might not like to negotiate, so ask a friend who isn’t afraid to negotiate to come along with you. You can say they are your partner or sibling and let them negotiate on your behalf. At a minimum, they can offer moral support.  Negotiating can be emotional, and you might be better off calling ahead of time.Describe your car briefly and ask the salesperson for their best quote. Who knows—someone might offer you the amount you are hoping to get.   Avoid setting up appointments to meet with someone. This is simply an invitation to come negotiate in person.  When you go to the dealership, you should avoid negotiating the price of your trade-in until you nail down the price of your new car. The salesperson might give you a good deal on your trade-in, but they’ll simply increase the amount you pay for the new car.If the dealer asks if you have a trade in, you can insist you don’t. Then you can change your mind.For example, you can say, “You know what? Maybe I do want to trade in my car.” Smile and shrug your shoulders.  You want the dealer to know that you aren’t a pushover. Instead, let them know you’ve done some basic research by saying, “I saw my car was listed as having a $10,000 trade-in value on Autotrader.com”The number you quote should be the highest you think you can get. Realize that you might have to go lower in order to close the deal.  You can expect the salesperson to make a lowball initial offer. Don’t be offended—and don’t be afraid to negotiate. A good idea is to ask them to explain why they think the car isn’t worth much.   For example, you can say, “I think $6,000 is a little low. Why don’t you think it’s worth $10,000?” Expect the salesperson to point out the flaws in your car.  Try not to budge too much from the amount you quoted. Instead, point out why your car is worth the amount you want. For example, the dealership might offer $6,000. You can say, “I agree the car is scratched on its bumper, but that can be fixed. It’s still in great condition, so I’d like close to $10,000.”   At this point you can pull out your service records and show what great condition the car is in.  Your strongest bargaining chip is your ability to walk away. The dealer will lose out on selling you a new car. Also, used cars are profit centers, and the dealer will lose out on your trade-in as well. Let the dealer know you’ll be showing the car to other people.   For example, you can say, “Is that your best offer? I’ve got to write it down so I remember it when I drive over to other dealer across town.”  , Don’t fell rushed to fill up silence by lowering how much you’re willing to accept for your trade-in. Instead, let the silence just sit there. Pretend to polish your car or look toward other cars on the lot and wait for the salesperson to say something.  At some point, you and the dealership will reach a stalemate. They’ll make their best offer for the trade-in. At that point, you should feel free to say, “I need to go shopping around. I’ll be in contact with you later.”   Remain polite and don’t let the salesperson bully you. If the salesperson pushes back, say, “I’ve got a meeting I need to be at.”  , See how much they are willing to give you for the car. You’ll have to go through the negotiations all over again, which can take time. However, if you want the best deal available, then shopping around is definitely worth your time. Ideally, you should visit at least three dealers.The amount a dealer offers depends in part on their inventory on the lot. For example, you might get a low offer if a dealer has several same-model used cars already on their lot.  

clean your car.  have your car detailed.  fix dents and scratches.  replace any broken bulbs.  remove bad smells.  consider replacing the tires.  estimate your car’s condition.  research your car’s value.  find your maintenance records.  get financing ahead of time.  make a copy of your registration.  put a few personal items back in the car.  bring a friend with you.  call ahead, if necessary.  negotiate the price of your new car first.  show the dealer your research.  reject the first offer for your trade-in.  make a counteroffer.  mention you’ll be shopping around.  embrace silence.  walk away.  visit different dealers. 

 These make your nails appear to be taller, and you can just use a thin section of tape. Paint over it, and then peel the tape off once the polish dries.  You can do these with a nail art pen, or a super thin nail polish brush. These designs will make it appear like your nail is big, and the decals are spread out.  This will draw attention away from your tips, and make your nails seem much larger. You don't even have to grow your nails out.  

consider an easy vertical stripe.  add tiny polka dots.  try a reverse french manicure. 

 Crete is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the Greek Islands. The island has beautiful natural parks, mountains, old cities, and nightlife. The island offers the largest array of different activities and sights for a vacation-goer.The islands of Mykonos and Santorini Islands in the Cyclades are both accessible to Crete via ferry boat, so you can visit multiple islands if you decide to visit.; , The Cyclades is another famous tourist destination and includes two of the most popular Greek Islands, Mykonos and Santorini.

 To brown food in a microwave without a dedicated browning dish, you must first cook the food through all the way. Browning in a microwave is completed after cooking, rather than during cooking.  Because microwaves cook from the inside out using superheated molecules, browning raw or uncooked food is not possible.  If your microwave is equipped with a grill rack, use this to place your food on. If not, simply place your food facedown in a microwave-safe dish.  A grill is ideal, as it provides beautiful sear marks for your food, and allows air to circulate more freely than a dish, resulting in a more even cooking experience.  Use your microwave’s grill, because the grill setting also concentrates heat on the metal portion of the grill and can create a browning effect. If your microwave does not have a “grill” feature, you can place a small amount of foil into the bottom of a glass or ceramic cooking dish to simulate a grill., Finish by placing your microwave on its highest setting and cooking as usual. While it will not brown as thoroughly as an oven, enlisting the help of small amounts of metal will concentrate heat on the outside of your food.  Cook according to the recipe. If you desire a crisper, browner texture, you can cook on high in the microwave, then finish by pan-searing or broiling your food in a standard oven.  

cook food all the way through first.  use a built-in microwave rack feature.  select the “grill” setting.  cook on high. 

 The only general rule to oiling your hair is that you should comb through it to prevent tangling and messy oil application. Beyond that, there's debate over whether hair should be clean when oiled. Some swear that oiling works better when the hair is already a little bit oily and dirty — say two or three days after your last shampooing. Others insist that oiling works best soon after you've shampooed your hair — when it’s clean and bare. Try it both ways to decide what you prefer.  Especially if you’re new to oiling your hair, there’s a good chance you’re going to make a mess.   Spread old towels or paper towels around the area where you’re going to work. This includes table surfaces and floors. Have an extra hand rag available for spot-cleaning drippy messes. If you’re going to sleep with oil in your hair, protect your pillows with plastic pillowcase coverings.  Pour one teaspoon of oil into the palm of your hand. Rub your hands together to spread the oil. You’ll be applying the oil mainly with your fingertips, so focus on spreading it there.          Using your fingertips, work the oils into your scalp. Use a massaging motion to both work the oil in and stimulate the scalp. (Plus, it feels great!) Make sure you cover the entire scalp area, including the back of your head, just above the neck, and behind your ears.  Split it right down the middle of your scalp, and pull one section over your left shoulder and the other over your right shoulder. This will make it easier to apply the base oil to the shafts of your hair.          You might tie one section into a piggy tail to keep it out of the way while you’re working on the other section.  If you have long hair, you might be tempted to pour a large amount of oil into your hands. This will always result in a dripping mess, though. No matter how much hair you’re working with, pour one teaspoon of oil into your palm at a time, adding more oil when you need it.          Run your hands through the length of your hair. Don’t neglect the hair on the back of your head.  

prepare your hair.  protect the area from oil splatter.  treat the roots and scalp.  section your hair into two parts.  treat the length of your hair. 

 If you’re afraid your mind is going to go blank in the middle of your date, you may want to come up some things you can talk about. What do you both have in common? What are you excited about or interested in? Having a few ideas in mind can help calm you down.For example, if you know that you both like cooking, travelling, or being outside, think of a few questions or stories you can tell dealing with those topics.  Though you may want to do something fun on your date, you shouldn’t do something new that will make you even more uncomfortable. You want to go to a place you're somewhat familiar and comfortable with. Even if it's not some place you've gone often, if it's in an area you know, that's enough to help calm you down.   For example, if you never go to fancy restaurants or the ballet, don't choose it as a first date location.  Dates should be fun. Sure, everyone goes to dinner and a movie, and that may be enjoyable for you. However, you can help calm your first date jitters by doing something you know will be fun. Try something you'd never think of as a first date. It may help both of you break the ice. For example, you can go window or regular shopping, work out together, go to a bookstore or music stores and look around, go hiking, or go to a museum. Choose an activity both of you can enjoy and are interested in, if you know what the other person likes. If you don't know what the other person likes, try to ask them. Often, doing these things help you show off your personality the most.  Though you want to look nice and dress to impress, don’t wear clothes you feel uncomfortable in. You won't feel like yourself. You'll be uneasy, and your date will be able to tell. Choosing a casual or nice outfit is best. Think about where you are going on your date and dress accordingly.For example, if you never wear dresses and heels or a suit and tie, don't do it on a first date. If you wear clothes you can’t breathe in or shoes you can’t walk in, you may start tripping or have trouble breathing.  

come up with a few topics of conversation.  pick a date location that makes you feel comfortable.  choose a fun activity.  dress comfortably. 

 Like most stressful conversations, it's a good idea to have some lines prepared in advance. Make a point of knowing how to open up the conversation, as well as how to break the rejection and end the conversation. Keep in mind that prepared lines only serve as a general guideline. The best way to let a girl down easily is to roll with the flow of the conversation.   You might, for instance, open the conversation by saying "I don't think this is going to work. I'm sure about that now, and it's important for you to know that has nothing to do with who you are as a person." At the same time, you won't do yourself any favours by planning too much. No interaction will ever go the exact way you expect it to, and if you leave yourself little room for improvisation, you'll fall and stumble the first time things don't go according to plan.  If you want to let a girl down easily, you need to show her she is still worth your time and respect. Dropping her a line over text message or social media is impersonal, and just about everyone is worth more than that. Keep short on any details when you call her to meet up. No one will willingly meet someone purely for the sake of being broken up with. Breaking up in person is, however, a much better choice for the long run.   For example: "Hey. I think it's a good idea for us to meet. Would you be free to meet at the park tomorrow morning?" Choose the place to meet based on what you anticipate her reaction will be. If she's prone to anger or even violence, meet up somewhere in public. That way, she will be less likely to make a scene. If the girl is shy and prone to crying however, it's better to do it someplace private, like her home. This will keep her from feeling embarrassed in public.  As tough as it may be to balance the break up with tenderness, its a necessary thing if you want to make it as painless as possible for the girl. Though you don't want to condescend or give her the impression that the decision isn't absolute, it's important you word things in such a way that makes it sound like you still care about her, even if the feelings are not romantic.For example, follow up the break-up declaration with a positive affirmation: "Even though I know we can't be together, that doesn't mean I don't care about you or want you as a part of my life. You're a really cool person, and I really mean that." Don't expect this to remove the pain or spectacle from her reaction. Even the nicest way of wording a break up is going to provoke feelings of heartbreak.  Making things go further than they need to will only confuse the girl. You should break the news right after saying hello. Remind yourself what the purpose of the meeting is. It's not to 'hang out'; if you are more interesting in spending time together than breaking up, it's probably a sign you should not be breaking up in the first place.   Be simple and leave no room for interpretation. At the same time, don't be mean or rude. This can be a tricky thing to balance, but you should break the news with something like this: "I don't think this is going to work out. I'm absolutely sure about it. I don't want you to think that this because of you. It's about where I am in life."  , You can be as to-the-point as you like, but only offering the news of the break up and leaving will seem cold. The girl is going to want some answers. One way you can word it delicately is by offering a reason or two why the relationship can't work out between you two. It is crucial that these reasons don't paint her in a negative light. External reasons, like school, work, family and other priorities can factor in. This will ease the blow to the girl's self-confidence.   Let her know that you don't have time for a relationship: "There are lots of reasons I don't feel I'm ready for a relationship right now. I'm very focused on school and don't feel like being with someone would match my priorities." It is definitely preferable that you are honest with the reasons. Even if you don't find the girl attractive, there may still be reasons why a relationship would be less than optimal. No matter how close you are with the girl, or what your relationship history has been, she probably deserves your total honesty.  In virtually every case, the girl is going to have something to say in response. You may even ask her for her feelings on your decision.She may be angry, or she may be desperate and try to get you back with some quick words. She might even be relieved. If you took the time to realistically consider how she might react towards letting her down, you should have an idea of what to expect. All the same, give her some time to thrown in her two cents.   She may be upset, but it's very important you remain calm. Two upset people is a perfect recipe for argument and disaster. Allowing her to respond and say her piece is an important part of healing. Venting is healthy, but it's good to keep a limit on it. If an interaction goes on for too long, it invites chaos.  Brevity is your friend when it comes to letting a girl down easily. The longer your conversation goes on for, the more likely it is for fuel to be added to the fire. If you want to make sure the damage is minimized, try to put a cap on the amount of time the conversation lasts for. Ten to fifteen minutes is a reasonable amount, taking her time to respond in consideration. Say goodbye, and don't be afraid to leave even if she's trying to push the conversation on indefinitely.  

have your lines prepared in advance.  ask to meet in person.  be compassionate.  cut to the chase.once you've met up with the girl, there is no point in beating around the bush.  state a reason that doesn't criticize her.this is arguably the most important part of letting someone down easily.  let her respond.  keep it brief. 

 While you're planning your trip, research the infectious diseases endemic to the area you want to visit. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers a useful webpage that allows you to easily identify illnesses by country. Knowing the diseases you may encounter will allow you to prepare properly!; , Visit your doctor 4-6 weeks before you leave for your trip. Ensure you are up-to-date on general vaccinations like Measles, Mumps, Pertussis, and Tetanus, and receive any vaccinations you need to for your trip. Some vaccines are recommended, but in other cases, you will not be allowed to enter a country without proof of vaccination.    Vaccination: If you're traveling to an area where Diphtheria, Hepatitis A, B, C, or E, Influenza, Viral Meningitis, Japanese Encephalitis, Polio, Rabies, Rubella, Typhoid, or Yellow Fever rates are high, consider vaccination to protect yourself.  Medication: If you are traveling to an area where malaria is present, talk to your doctor about anti-malaria medication.  Insect Repellant: Many infections are caused by bug bites including malaria, dengue, trypanosomaisis, chikungunya, yellow fever, and West Nile virus. There are no known cures to these ailments, so protect yourself from exposure by using insect repellent. Look for strong active ingredients like DEET, Picaridin, oil of lemon, eucalyptus, and IR3535, and wear permithrin-treated clothing.  In some instances, you may choose to cancel, reschedule, or postpone your trip. For example, the CDC strongly recommends that pregnant women avoid locations endemic with malaria. If you are pregnant and must travel to a country where malaria is present, talk to your doctor about your anti-malaria medication options.  The CDC offers valuable infectious disease travel information by country, and updates the travel warning regularly.  You can contract various types of infection by drinking contaminated water or eating contaminated food. Areas with poor water sanitation or inadequate sewage systems can lead to infection.   In these locations, avoid contaminated water by only drinking unopened canned or bottled drinks and avoiding ice. Beverages involving boiled water like coffee and tea are okay. Avoid possible contaminated foods like meat that has been allowed to cool (street vendors), raw vegetables including salads, raw fruit unless it is washed with clean water and peeled, and unpasteurized dairy.  Travelers commonly experience diarrhea which can often be cured with rest and hydration.   If diarrhea persists, contact your doctor. If you experience fever at all, inform your doctor upon your return. If you become very ill, contact the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate.They can help you find a doctor near your current travel location. For more information regarding illness abroad, look to the CDC's research on Obtaining Health Care Abroad. 

educate yourself.  talk to your doctor.  cancel, reschedule, or plan a different trip if needed.  be aware of travel advisories.  always keep food and water safety in mind.  recognize symptoms while traveling and visit your doctor when you return. 

 Some good choices include fat-free or low-fat dairy milk, soy milk, cool herbal tea, almond milk, juice, or water. Make sure that you consider the fat and calories when choosing liquid bases for diet smoothies because this can have a dramatic effect on the overall fat and calories of your smoothie.   For example, a smoothie made with juice will have up to 200 calories more than a smoothie made with water.The ratio of the liquid base to the fruits and vegetables should be about two to ¾. That means that for every two cups of liquid base you should add about ¾ of a cup of fruit, vegetables, or other ingredients. Pour your liquid ingredients into the blender first.; , You can add whatever fruits and vegetables you would like to use. Fresh fruits and vegetables may taste better and have more nutritional value, but frozen fruits and vegetables work well also. Make sure that you look up the fat and calories before you decide. For example, a banana has more calories than an orange or a carrot, and an avocado has more fat than a cup of spinach.   Some good low-calorie fruit choices include peaches, strawberries, oranges, watermelon, cantaloupe, and papaya.Low-calorie vegetable choices include celery, cucumbers, carrots, kale, and spinach.Keep in mind that fresh and frozen fruits and veggies will thicken a smoothie, but frozen fruits and vegetables will also make your smoothie cold. Toss in a handful of ice cubes if using fresh fruit.If you have a high powered blender, then fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables should be easy to blend. If your blender is not too powerful, then you may want to defrost your fruit or even cook the vegetables first to soften them up a bit. Rinse off fruits and veggies before adding them to the blender to ensure that they are free of dirt and debris.  Nuts and seeds can be a good addition for adding healthy fats and protein to a smoothie. Just keep in mind that these ingredients will also increase the calories and fat in your smoothie. Some good nuts and seeds to try in a smoothie include:   almonds cashews sunflower seeds chia seeds flaxseeds, You can also change the flavor of your smoothie without any added fat or calories by adding a dash of spice. Consider what spices will work best with your other smoothie ingredients. For example, if you are making an apple smoothie, then a dash of cinnamon would be a nice complement. Some good spices to consider when making smoothies include:   cinnamon ginger nutmeg cloves chili powder cayenne pepper cardamom  , Adults only need about 48-56 grams of protein per day, so adding protein to your diet smoothie may not be necessary if you get enough protein from other sources. But if you are replacing a meal with a smoothie each day, then adding protein may be a good idea.If you want a diet smoothie that is packed with protein, then add a scoop of protein before you blend. To keep the fat and calories low, choose a protein powder without added sugars and that is low in fat. Read labels to find a protein powder that is low in fat and calories.  After you have all of your ingredients in the blender, place the lid on the blender and blend the ingredients on high for about one to two minutes. You can blend for longer if needed.   If ingredients seem to be getting stuck in the bottom of the blender or on the sides, then turn off the blender, wait for the blades to stop completely, and then use a spoon to stir the ingredients. Then, remove the spoon, replace the lid, and blend on high again. If the contents of your smoothie seem too thick, then you can add a little more water or other liquid. If the contents seem too thin, then try adding a bit of ice or a couple more pieces of fruit. When the ingredients have all been liquefied, then transfer your smoothie to a glass and serve!  

start with a low-calorie, low-fat liquid base.  add fruits and vegetables.  include some nuts or seeds.  try some spices.  add a scoop of protein powder.  blend all of the ingredients. 

 Students generally talk to their friends about tests and even about the answers to tests.   For example, keep an eye on students who leave your first period class after a test. If they walk a little with a second period student, they may be sharing answers or passing cheat sheets.  Some students will create a private group on Facebook or Google for the class, using it to exchange notes. If the class is large enough, you might be able to sign up for the class posing as a student, using an assumed name.Some course management systems, such as Blackboard, have an option of letting students email each other without the instructor seeing the emails. Change the preferences so that you also see the emails that students send out through the system.  Often, students might pretend that they are interested in the class, visiting you in office hours and engaging with the class material. These students might butter you up so that you don’t suspect them of cheating because you perceive them to be good students., Do not allow students to be in your classroom when you are not there. Lock filing cabinets and desk drawers to prevent students from looking at tests, and watch for this behavior when you are in the classroom as well.   Create and memorize complex passwords for computer and grade book log-ins; do not write this information on paper.  

listen to hallway conversations.  sign up for the class social media group under an assumed name.  be cautious with favorite students.  protect your physical and digital spaces. 

 You will be using this pot to steam the broccoli, so make sure that it is large enough to hold the broccoli and the steamer pot. Place the pot on the stove.  The bottom of the basket should not be touching the water.   If you don't have a steamer basket, use a colander instead.If you don't have a colander, you may place the broccoli directly in the water. You will need only a few tablespoons of water.Make sure the water doesn't completely cover the broccoli.  Turn the stove on and set the heat to medium-high. Wait until the water begins to simmer.  Try to arrange them evenly across the basket. At this time, you can also lightly season them with some salt, pepper, or butter. Click here for more ideas.        If you want to check and see if your broccoli is done, you can try stabbing it with a fork; if the fork goes easily into the broccoli, it is ready., Be very careful when opening the pot; do not lean over it or the steam may hit you in the face and burn you.       Consider seasoning the broccoli with salt, pepper, or garlic. Click here for some more ideas.  

fill a pot with about an inch of water.  place a steamer basket inside the pot.  bring the water to a simmer.  place the broccoli in the steamer basket.  cover the pot with a lid and steam for four to five minutes.watch the broccoli carefully so that you don't overcook it.  remove the pot from the burner and transfer the broccoli to a serving dish. 

 Start with just a few numbers to get a feel for Italian. Pay attention to how the numbers are spelled, but focus on their pronunciation. Stressed (accented) syllables are in all caps:0 zero (TSEH-ro) 1 uno (OO-no) 2 due (DOO-eh) 3 tre (TREH) 4 quattro (KWAHT-tro) 5 cinque (CHEEN-kweh); , Once you have the first few numbers down, you’re ready to learn up to ten. Make sure to pay attention to the number ten, which is the first to have three syllables (and the stress on the second).6 sei (SEH-ee) 7 sette (SET-teh) 8 otto (OHT-toh) 9 nove (NOH-veh) 10 dieci (dee-EH-chee)  , After you’ve mastered the first few numbers in Italian, you’ll have a good sense for how the language sounds. The numbers eleven through twenty are a bit longer, but you can see that parts of them will sound very similar to the numbers 1-10 (undici, or "eleven," for example, sounds a lot like uno plus dieci, or one plus ten).11 undici (OON-dee-chee) 12 dodici (DOH-dee-chee) 13 tredici (TREH-dee-chee) 14 quattordici (kwaht-TOR-dee-chee) 15 quindici (KWEEN-dee-chee) 16 sedici (SEH-dee-chee) 17 diciassette (dee-chahs-SET-teh) 18 diciotto (dee-CHOHT-toh) 19 diciannove (dee-chahn-NOH-veh) 20 venti (VEN-tee)  , Using the numbers as often as possible will help them stick in your memory. Regular practice will also help you feel more comfortable speaking Italian. Try a combination of techniques to use the numbers, such as:Making flashcards and quizzing yourself Counting everyday objects, like coins or grapes Using Italian numbers whenever you have to do mental math Playing games, like Uno, that let you easily say the numbers in Italian.  Knowing how to say words correctly in Italian will make you sound more natural when speaking the language. Italian vowels are a distinctive part of the language’s sound, so make sure to pay attention to their correct pronunciation:a is pronounced like the first “a’ in “papa”  i usually sounds like the “ee” in “beet.” Occasionally, after some consonants, it will sound like a “y” as in “yet”  u is usually pronounced like the “oo” in “boot.” Sometimes (like after the letter g), u can sound like a “w”.  e is pronounced either like the “e” in “bet” (open form) or the “a” in “chaotic” (closed form)  o sounds close to either the vowel in “awe” (open form) or the “o” in “go”  , Most consonants in Italian are relatively close to their English equivalents. Beyond that, it’s mostly a matter of paying attention to a few guidelines and a couple of special cases:c and g can be either hard (before a, o, or u) or soft (before e or i). A hard c sounds like the “c” in “car." A soft c sounds like the “ch” in “chase.” Say a hard g like the “g” in “go,” but a soft one like the beginning of “general.” When there is an h after a c or g, the sound will be hard.  sc is pronounced like the “sh” in “ship.”  r in Italian is slightly trilled.  S is sometimes pronounced “ess” and sometimes like a “z.” Similarly, z can sound like an English “z” or like a “ts” sound, as in pizza. The cluster gn sounds close to the “ny” in “canyon,” and gl is close to the middle sound in “million.” Hold double consonants, such as in the middle of tutto, longer than you would in English.  If you're comfortable saying the numbers up to twenty in Italian, then a logical next step is to go even higher. To say “twenty-one,” “twenty-two,” and so on, you’ll follow a pattern that combines numbers very similar to the way that English does:21 ventuno (ven-TOO-noh) 22 ventidue (ven-tee-DOO-eh) 23 ventitré (ven-tee-TREH) 24 ventiquattro (ven-tee-KWAHT-troh) 25 venticinque (ven-tee-CHEEN-kweh) 26 ventisei (ven-tee-SEH-ee) 27 ventisette (ven-tee-SET-teh) 28 ventotto (ven-TOHT-toh) 29 ventinove (ven-tee-NOH-veh)  , Once you’ve have a sense of the basic pattern for how higher numbers are formed in Italian, you can start expanding your vocabulary. Try saying the tens up to one hundred:30 trenta (TREN-tah) 40 quaranta (kwah-RAHN-tah) 50 cinquanta (cheen-KWAHN-tah) 60 sessanta (ses-SAHN-tah) 70 settanta (set-TAHN-ta) 80 ottanta (oht-TAHN-ta) 90 novanta (noh-VAHN-tah) 100 cento (CHEN-toh)  , If you know someone who speaks Italian, ask them to let you practice with them! Start with a few greetings and introductions. For example, you might say:Hello - Ciao (CHOW) My name is Melissa - Mi chiamo Melissa (ME kee-AH-mo Melissa) What is your name? - Come ti chiami? (CO-may TEE kee-AH-mee) Nice to meet you - Piacere di conoscerti (PYA-cheh-ray DEE ko-no-SHER-tee) How are you? - Come stai? (CO-may STAH-ee) I am fine - Sto bene (STO BEH-nay) Goodbye - Ciao or Arrivederci (ah-REE-veh-dehr-chee)  , Once you’ve got some of the basics down, try picking up some everyday words and phrases. Audio and visual aids are fun ways to make progress. Try using apps like Duolingo, for instance. There are also podcasts, Youtube videos, and other media materials that can help you get used to the sound of the language.  

learn the numbers up to five.  follow up with six through ten.  try eleven through twenty.  practice the numbers.  learn the sounds of italian vowels.  practice pronouncing italian consonants.  learn the numbers up to twenty-nine.  learn some higher numbers.  pick up some conversational phrases.  use audio and visual aids to increase your vocabulary. 

 Turn individual steps into hidden caches by replacing your staircase’s basic paneling with oversized slide-out drawers. Stair drawers are perfect for when you want to get everyday items out of the way but still keep them close at hand. Use your stair drawers to stash things like shoes, sporting equipment, pet supplies and household tools.Stair drawers have gained popularity as a creative storage solution, and can be installed in homes of almost any size. Each drawer is the length and width of one step, giving you tons of bonus space that was formerly off-limits.; , Build into the flat, blank wall lining a small stairwell and use it to mount sturdy shelves of various sizes. Now you’ll have a dedicated place for books, trinkets and family photos that won’t take up any additional room around your home.Have the shelves cut and arranged to your own specifications to create wall storage that matches your needs.  With little difficulty, you can convert a section of the wall or an unused alcove at the top of the stairs to a convenient built-in cabinet. Integrated cabinets fulfill the same function as shelves, but give you more options in how to store and display your belongings.Have wall cabinets designed to blend in with the area around them.Cabinets can act as all-purpose storage or be based around a specific theme, such as preserving mementos from your wedding.  

upgrade to stair drawers.  put in handy wall shelving.  invest in custom cabinets. 

 Career objectives are not usually included in resumes. However, in some cases it can be beneficial for you to include an objective.   If you're changing fields, like going from marketing to accounting, an objective can help employees see how your marketing specific skill sets could be applicable to accounting.If you're very young and have limited experience, an objective might help you sell yourself to an employee even if your experience is small.If you're applying for a specific position, always include an objective., Watch out for certain pitfalls people encounter when writing a career objective.

Phrases like "dynamic self starter with an entrepreneurial spirit" are both incredibly vague and overused. Avoid phrasing that sounds too familiar. An employer is likely to toss out a career objective that's laden with cliches., You should never send out the same objective for multiple jobs. Always cater your objective based on the skills a job posting is asking for. 

know when to include a career objective.  learn common mistakes people make when writing objectives.  write several career objectives. 

 Whether it’s you or your crush planning the first date – or perhaps, it’s a mutual effort – figure out what the date will entail before you plan your wardrobe. Dressing for your date will be easier once you know what’s in store for the actual date.For a classic dinner and a movie date, you’ll know to dress in nicer, fancier clothes. Don’t forget to discuss exactly where dinner will be, so that you can gauge how dressy you need to be. For a hiking date, casual jeans and a t-shirt or gym clothes are perfectly acceptable first date wear!; , There’s nothing wrong with doing a little shopping for a first date, especially if you have a fun activity planned and need a few new items to prepare.   Although it’s not necessary to go shopping, wearing something new will show your date that you’ve made extra effort.  Before deciding on exactly what to wear, try on a few different options. What you’ve envisioned as the perfect clothing combination in your head might look different once you’ve got it on.If your first date involves lots of movement – perhaps you are taking a ballroom dancing class together or going horseback riding – make sure you can move freely and comfortably in each outfit you try.  First dates can be nerve-wracking enough as it is – you don’t want to add extra worry by wearing uncomfortable, tight, see-through, or low-cut clothing if that’s not a look you were intending.   You will be happiest and most at ease if you wear clothes you like and feel confident and comfortable in., Everyone wants to look their best for the first date, but unless you’re planning to attend a Halloween party together, don’t dress up as someone else. Wear an outfit that reflects your own personal style and flare.   Not only will you feel more relaxed, but it will be easier for your date to get to know and adore you!  , You don’t need a brand new outfit or expensive clothes to impress your date, but it is important that your clothes are clean, neat, and wrinkle-free. Be sure to make any necessary laundry or repair preparations ahead of time.   If you did buy new clothes, be sure to remove tags and stickers. Sometimes, they like to hide and you don’t want your date to be the one to find them while you’re out! To ensure that your date outfit stays neat and clean, consider keeping it and any extra accessories stored inside a closed garment bag in your closet until you are ready to wear it.  Depending on the type of date you have planned, you’ll want to plan for your hair accordingly. Practice styling it a few days ahead of your date to make sure your vision goes with your outfit. You don’t want to be scrambling with your hair leading up to your date.   If you plan to wear makeup, you may also want to try out your intended look a few days before your date, just to make sure application goes smoothly and that you achieve your vision.  If you’re a guy that breaks out after a fresh shave or you’re a girl who gets a little red after a fresh eyebrow wax, plan on some pre-date grooming a day or two in advance so that you have time to recover and look your best!   Although grooming is important, don’t undergo any procedures just for the sake of the date. If you feel like you have to dress or appear a certain way to impress your date, the person probably isn’t right for you. You deserve to be seen and adored for who you are!  , Before you start getting dressed, double check the weather for the timeframe of your date. Even if you plan to spend most of the time inside, you still have to get there and you’ll want to keep your clothes neat and dry.   Grab a raincoat if it’s raining or re-think your long-sleeved shirt and pants if it’s unseasonably warm. If the weather is particularly wet or snowy, consider wearing a pair of boots during travel and taking your nice pair of shoes to change into once you arrive at your destination. If you know your date’s size, grab an extra sweater, umbrella, or raincoat if the weather is bad, in case he or she doesn't think to bring one. Your date will be impressed by the sweet gesture and that you thought to plan ahead.  Even if you’re headed for a 5k marathon on your first date, you’re going to want to smell nice and clean when you first meet up.   If you need extra time to blow-dry your hair before you style it, make sure you budget enough time.  When you’re anxious or stressed, that tends to be the time a button falls off or a zipper gets stuck or your nylons get a run. It’s better to be ready too early than scramble around because you’re late. Take your time getting dressed so you can handle any last minute mishaps with your garments!, Even if you’re planning on a fancy dinner at a swanky hotel or you’re attending a prestigious ballet performance, plans can change. For example, you and your date might have so much fun that you’ll decide to take a walk for ice cream or stay up all night watching old movies together!   Pack something comfortable, so you’re prepared to go with the flow!  , If you’re taking a purse or you need a water bottle and a hiking pass for the state park, make sure you’ve got all the accessories you’ll need for a successful date.   Make sure your cell phone is charged in case of an emergency. It’s always a good idea to bring a little extra cash with you, in case the date doesn’t go well and you need to get a ride home or the date goes so well, you splurge for extra dessert.  It’s normal to be nervous and anxious before a first date, but don’t let your clothes be a factor. Be confident in what you’ve chosen, enjoy yourself, and concentrate on getting to know this new wonderful person you’re with., Some people are especially sensitive to scents and sprays, and too much scent can be overwhelming. Apply just a single spray or a few dabs.   Deodorant is always a good idea, but be careful not to over-apply that either.  Even if you have extremely dry skin, consider skipping an application right before your big date. First dates are always a bit nerve-wracking, and you’ll likely be sweaty (or greasy) until you settle in. By avoiding moisturizer for the date, you can try to avoid unwanted shine.  Choosing a few simple pieces to accentuate your outfit (if you’re going somewhere fancy) is appropriate, but if you’re drowning in jewelry, your date might feel distracted by it.  A bright red burn or a bad haircut could ruin your whole look, so skip any drastic changes right before your date.  

find out what the date entails.  go shopping.  try on a few different options.  wear what’s most comfortable.  choose an outfit that reflects who you are.  make sure your outfit is clean and ready to wear.  decide on a hairstyle and practice it.  do some pre-date grooming.  double check the weather.  take a shower.  give yourself plenty of time to get dressed.  pack a change of casual clothes.  double check that you’ve got everything.  don’t stress.  don’t use too much perfume or cologne.  skip the moisturizer.  don’t wear too much jewelry.  don’t get a tan or a haircut right before your date. 

 The type of swimming you do to stay fit will depend on what you want to accomplish with your fitness routine. For most fitness swimmers, a combination of strokes is used to provide a full-body workout.For example, if you want to lose weight, you'll want to focus on the strokes that you can perform well and for the longest period of time, so you can get the greatest fat-burning benefits out of your exercise sessions. Once you've identified your major goal or goals, break them down into small, reachable goals so you can constantly monitor your progress and get a continual sense of achievement.  Once you've gotten used to swimming regularly, you'll get more out of each swimming session if you follow a specific plan rather than simply lapping up and down the pool without focus.Check swimming sites online, such as the U.S. Masters Swimming Program at usms.org, or the England Masters at swimming.org. You'll find various swimming plans tailored to achieving particular fitness goals, as well as tips on how to improve the efficiency of your stroke. Other fitness clubs or local swimming clubs also may publish swimming workout routines on their websites. Some pools also provide suggested workout programs on laminated sheets along the walls of the pool area or locker room.  Particularly if you're just getting started with swimming, you may benefit from the structure of a class and an instructor who can correct your form. There are a wide variety of classes available if you want to swim to stay fit.If you find the idea of swimming laps boring, you might enjoy a water aerobics class, or a different water exercise class. You also might choose different classes to meet your specific fitness goals. For example, if you want to improve your flexibility, you might try a water yoga class.  You'll only see overall fitness benefits if you swim on a regular basis. Ideally, try to swim at least two or three times a week. Even if you can only swim once a week, you'll still improve your fitness provided you're keeping active in other ways.If you've just started, even those first few laps may prove more difficult than you anticipated. Just keep with it. Aim to increase the amount of time you swim with each visit. For example, your first few swims you may only be able to swim for 10 minutes. After a few 10-minute swims, increase your time to 15 minutes. The next week, increase your time again until you've built up to 45- or 60-minute swims.  Even if you're a proficient swimmer, you should include other types of exercise besides just swimming laps. If you want to keep your workout in the water, consider taking a water aerobics class.Variety is important when swimming laps as well. Sticking to a single stroke can get boring after awhile, which can make it difficult to stay motivated and stick with your fitness routine. It also can be beneficial to supplement your swimming workouts with strength training workouts to help build your muscles. Focus on exercises that build the muscles you use the most when swimming, such as your shoulders, arms, and legs.  Rather than going it alone, getting a swim coach or swimming with a friend or family member can help you stay motivated. If you enjoy a little friendly competition, you can race each other or compete for most laps or fastest overall time.You also may be less inclined to skip swimming sessions if there's another person involved who is counting on you to show up and well help keep you honest.  As with any exercise, you want to start your swimming session with a warm-up and end it with a cool-down to give your body a chance to readjust to its pre-exercise state.With a swimming workout, a few slow laps at the beginning and end of your session function perfectly well as a warm-up or a cool-down. You also may want to treat yourself to a hot tub or sauna if those are available where you swim. If your pool has a café, a healthy snack or protein shake after your swim can be invigorating and rewarding.  

set your fitness goals.  search online for workout plans.  join a class.  swim consistently.  vary your routine.  join forces with a buddy.  include a cool-down at the end of each swim. 

 Your dog is going to be scared and confused during and after a seizure, so it is crucial to do everything that you can to help them feel less afraid. If your dog suffers from frequent seizures, you will also want to learn how to recognize the signs of a seizure so that you can prepare. Some simple steps that you can take to comfort your dog during a seizure include:Placing a cushion or pillow beneath your dog’s head. This will help to protect your dog's head during a seizure. Speaking to your dog in a low, soothing voice. Say things like, "It's okay, buddy. That's a good dog. Easy, easy, I got you." Petting your dog in a calming, gentle way. You may also consider letting your dog lay across your lap or holding them if they are a small dog.; , It is a misconception that dogs will swallow their tongues, and under no circumstances should you stick your hand or fingers into your dog's mouth when they are having a seizure. You will get bit. Do not try to put any objects into your dog’s mouth either or your dog may break a tooth or even choke., It is important to get your dog calmed down before taking any other action. Sometimes the seizure may restart if your dog is very nervous and/or tries to get up before they have recovered. Continue soothing your dog and stay close for a while after the episode.To help your dog relax, keep the room quiet. Turn off the television and TV and don’t allow more than one or two people in the room. Take other pets out of the room as well.  Try to keep track of how long the seizures last. If your phone is handy, taking a video of the event may also help the veterinarian to diagnose your dog.   If the seizure continues for longer than five minutes, get your pet to a veterinary emergency room as soon as possible. Long seizures can exhaust the respiratory muscles and this can interfere with your dog's ability to breathe. 

comfort your dog.  keep your hands out of your dog’s mouth.  soothe your dog after the seizure.  pay attention to the duration of your dog’s seizures. 

 Before you can start a radon testing business, you'll need to know much more about its practice. This information can be found by researching radon online or by viewing the EPA's introductory guide at https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-05/documents/hmbuygud.pdf. Links to more articles and additional sources can be found at https://www.epa.gov/radon. Focus on learning important facts, such as:   According to the EPA, all homes and schools below the third floor are at risk for high levels of radon. Buildings in certain areas of the country are more susceptible to high levels of radon. EPA guidelines state that any result over 4.0 pCi/L (picocuries per liter) represents an unsafe level of radon.; , There are 2 types of radon testing kits: short-term and long-term testing kits. Short-term kits test the radon levels in a home for a period of time between 2 and 90 days, depending on the type of kits. Long-term kits stay in a home for over 90 days and offer a more accurate reading of the year-round radon levels in a home.   All radon kits should be placed on the lowest lived-in area of a home or building. Place them at least 20 inches (50 cm) off the floor and away from exterior walls, drafts, and high humidity or heat.There are many different types of radon test kits, each with different specific benefits and drawbacks. Read through the different types at http://www.nrsb.org/devices.asp.  Some states regulate radon professionals independently or EPA guidelines. These states may require those who measure or those mitigate radon levels, or both, to obtain and maintain a license to do so. Others may simply require them to register. In any case, you'll need to check with the appropriate regulatory body in your state to find out what its requirements are.State requirements can be found by visiting https://certi.us/cms/radon-training/state-radon-training-requirements and selecting your state.  Even if your state does not require you to be licensed, you should still seek professional certification to gain credibility with your customers. The National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) certifies radon professionals as part of the National Radon Proficiency Program (NRPP). Certified radon testers and mitigators are also listed on the NRPP's website, making you more visible to potential customers.To become certified, you will need to take a qualifying education course and then pass a certification exam. At this point you can apply for NRPP certification. There are two different measurement (testing) certifications: standard services and standard and analysis services. The second includes a device performance test and the ability to analyze radon test results yourself rather than sending your device to a lab.  Certification courses can be found at http://aarst-nrpp.com/wp/entry-level-courses/. There are options that take place in actual classrooms and some that are done entirely online. Anyone looking to start a radon testing business should take and pass one of the radon measurement courses. The exam will be offered at the end of the in-class course or can be signed up for at http://www.psiexams.com/.   Courses are 16 hours in total and cover everything from the science behind radon creation to choosing a test device and analyzing results. Exams are typically 100 multiple choice questions, which you will have 2 hours to complete. Exam fees are $110.00.Certifications last for two years, after which point they can be renewed with the appropriate continuing education., Research whether there's a need for a radon testing business in your area. Check online and in the phone book for similar, existing businesses. If there already are a number of established radon testing businesses, expand your potential customer base to another area. Or, if you can, identify an underserved market for radon testing.   For example, there are a variety of potential customers of a radon testing business, from landlords and homeowners to large business and local governments. Try talking to realtors to assess the market for residential testing in your area. Forming relationships with them may also later prove useful, as they can provide you with referrals., Before you can start your business, you will need a plan for operating it. This includes addresses how much it will cost to get started. Expenses to consider include the costs of your start up, testing kits, transportation, marketing, and taxes. Describe how you will find customers, what testing options you will offer, and what your projected income is for the first 2 years. Also include a list of radon mitigation companies that you can refer customers to if their tests reveal high radon levels.   You should also consider where you will work from. It is possible to run this type of business from home, so that should be your first option is costs are an issue. Include a description of the planned structure for your business. Most radon testing businesses are sole proprietorships, but you may want to consider other structures, like an LLC or partnership., Search for professional radon testing kits by searching for suppliers online. Make sure to check the reputation of each supplier by reading consumer reviews and asking for references. Also inquire how long it takes to deliver each order of radon tests, and how much they cost. Make sure you're getting professional radon testing kits instead of consumer ones. Otherwise, customers will have no reason to hire you.   The Radon Testing Corporation of America, PRO-LAB, and AccuStar are all reputable providers of testing equipments. See the NRPP's full list of approved devices by visiting their website at http://aarst-nrpp.com/wp/approved-devices/.  You won't need much money to get started, but you will have to raise that money somehow if you don't already have it. Your options for doing so include taking out a small business loan, obtaining a personal loan from a friend or family member, or selling your own assets. If you choose to get a loan, seek a business loan guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA), as this may be easier for the average borrower to qualify for.Your startup costs will include the following:   Testing kits and a method to have them analyzed. Many kits include free lab testing. The cost of these will vary based on what type of kits you choose and how many you buy to start. Certification fees if you have not already been certified. Transportation expenses. Funds for advertising. This amount can vary widely and depends on how actively you plan to advertise. Insurance. Radon measurement professionals will need errors and omissions or general liability insurance to protect them from legal action. Specific radon professional insurance plans are available through the North American Professional Liability Insurance Agency (NAPLIA)., Check with your city or county office to see what specific license requirements you have to meet. In most cases, you will need to register a "doing business as" (DBA) name. This name distinguishes your business from you and must be unique (not already taken by another business). Contact the relevant local office to register your DBA name., Place your order for your radon testing supplies based on how many homes or businesses you think you'll service during your initial operations. You can always buy more later if you need them. Most sites will have the supplies listed by how many locations they can test.   Divide the price of the testing supplies by the number of tests they offer to arrive at a test per measurement cost. You can shop around to reduce this cost and, in doing so, increase your profit margin., Print business cards, flyers, and price lists to give to potential customers. Also promote your business on the Internet by means of a website and social networks. Consider purchasing radio or newspaper advertisements if you have the money for it. You can also engage in free marketing by networking with local contractors, inspectors, real estate agents, and builders who might have use of your radon testing services.   Your radon testing education should have given you the tools you need to explain radon risks to customers. Use this information as part of your marketing strategy to explain to them why they need to have their home tested and the risks of not doing so., Once your business is running, you may have certain customers with unsafe levels of radon in their home or business. In this situation, you will want to know of a reputable radon mitigation business to which you can recommend your customers. You can even negotiate a "finder's fee" where you get a portion of the mitigator's earnings from customers you send their way.

 You can preserve your own patience going into homework time by making sure you and your child are on the same page. Sit down with your child and talk about what they need to work on this school year. Then, map out a plan that makes sure they can do the homework that is assigned and cover other important skillsets in the specified amount of time.Think about what has worked in the past, or what may have been helpful for their siblings at that age. Include your child in this plan, talking to them about what time they prefer to do homework and which aids are more helpful.  You and your child are both less likely to become frustrated when you know what to expect. Set a consistent schedule for homework, on weekdays and weekends. Stick to this plan as closely as you can. That way, your child has structure around their homework time just as they do at school., For small children especially, homework time may require a lot of guidance. Situate them in an environment where you can supervise their work. The area must also be quiet enough to help them focus.A popular place in many homes for homework is the kitchen or dining room table. Make sure the area is well-lit, stocked with the necessary supplies, and free of distractions like the television or toys. Ask other family members to steer clear of the area during homework time whenever possible.  Plan out each night’s (or week’s) homework assignments and ask your child what they think is the best way to divide up big tasks.Working on one aspect of a project at a time reduces frustration and builds confidence as they move along.  If you’re not a natural teacher, you might struggle with explaining new concepts to a kindergartner or first-grader. You’re less likely to grow impatient with your child when you have practical aids on hand to help them learn new topics.   Find out what skills your child is learning and research books, toys, and online videos that may assist them. One free online resource for homework help is HippoCampus.org. It features educational video content in over 13 subjects.Every child has their own learning style, so using a variety of learning methods may assist children who learn better through hands-on or auditory approaches.

 Have the round part of the saddle be pointing downwards, as shown.  Next to this sketch in a smaller, teardrop-like shape to serve as the base of the grip., This should be coming straight off the front of the saddle, so don't hesitate to draw it boldly., This will serve as the seat itself. Also add a portion to the top of the grip., Add stretched drop shapes for the stirrups., These should connect the sides of the stirrup so a foot could rest in it comfortably., Alternately you can use bright colors and decorations, if you're putting the saddle on a flamboyant show horse--the overall look is up to you!

 If you want to start off on the right foot, then you and your date have to put your arms in the right place first. For the prom slow dance, the arm movements are much simpler than for the traditional slow dance. The guy just has to put his arms on either side of the girl's waist, and the girl has to wrap her arms around the guy's waist.   Depending on how intimate you want the dance move to be, you should dance about one foot to half a foot (30 - 15 cm) away from your partner. Girls should plan their shoe height in advance. They should wear shoes that wouldn't make them taller than or at eye-level with their date, or they may feel a little awkward during the slow dance.  Face your partner with at least one to two feet between your heads. Don't stand with your toes touching or you'll bump into each other; instead, stand either with your feet alternating or with the girl's feet inside of the guy's. Keep your feet at last 1 to 1.5 feet (0.3 to 0.5 m) apart (30 cm-45 cm) so you can move from side to side without any problems.  Slow dancing is about as easy as it gets. Just keep your arms positioned correctly, maintain a respectable distance from your partner, and sway back and forth, transferring your weight from one foot to the other without lifting your feet. If you want to rotate or move a bit, just move your feet in rhythm with your partner's.   If you're comfortable with this simple dance, you can go for the "step touch," which means to just step to the right with your right foot, and then to follow this foot with your left, tap the ground, and then reverse the motion by stepping to the left with your left foot, letting the right foot follow it, and so on. Just make sure you keep your feet in sync with your partner's.  In "real" slow dancing, the guy takes the lead while the girl follows. In this version, the guy holds one of the girl's hands and leads her into the direction he wants to go; the girl has to follow so they stay on course. But when you're talking about the good old prom slow dance, that's really not necessary. You'll just be moving from side to side.   If the guy wants to lead, just follow his cue and move in the direction he moves; but for the most part, you won't be moving around too much. Just remember to dance to the beat of the music. Not all slow dance songs have the exact same rhythm, so you will have to move a bit faster or slower depending on the beat.  If you and your partner are totally in love, then sure, you can just sway there and look longingly into each other's eyes. But for most of you, slow dancing in silence could get a little boring or awkward, so don't be afraid to talk to your partner, crack a joke, or just make small talk a little bit. You can say you love or hate the song that's playing, compliment your partner on his or her looks or dancing skills, or talk about the couples around you. Do whatever you gotta do to have fun and feel comfortable.  

position your arms correctly.  position your feet correctly.  start moving.  don't worry about assuming traditional roles.  chat a little bit.

 Having a surprise party is great, but having one in public where you won't have to spend a bunch of time afterward cleaning up? Way better for a dude. Either plan the party at a friend's house, or plan the party at a local pub or restaurant that he likes.  Again, this can't be overstated: Guys like to eat and drink. If you're going to throw a surprise party, get the dude-food in hand. Figure out what he likes best and provide those drinks and refreshments.   If your guy's a meat and potatoes kind of guy, plan a backyard barbecue. Get a friend of his who is good on the grill to make up some brats or ribs, and make sure to get enough for everyone. If your guy prefers healthy food, plan out a trip to a local spot he hasn't tried yet. Make reservations for all of his friends, buy him a full tasting menu and plan the meet-up.  It's not usually necessary to waste a bunch of time and effort in making big decorations for a guy's party. If it makes you happy, go for it. If it seems like a big drag on your time and energy, then forget about it. He may not get how much time and effort it took you to create all the elaborate decorations, anyway.  Pretend like you might have forgotten that it's his birthday, or plan a surprise party for him on a random day. You can wish him a happy birthday to avoid letting his mood sink too low, but do not give away any hints to suggest that you have a roomful of his favorite people, food and gifts waiting for him back home.   Alternatively, you can also plan a surprise party for an occasion that does not usually get a party. A promotion, for instance, is an exciting life event that is not always celebrated formally, but you can surprise him by planning a party to celebrate his accomplishment.  Demonstrating that you like your guy's friends? That's huge. Surprise your boyfriend by inviting his friends over to watch a game or to play cards with him.   Alternatively, you can ask his friends to meet you and him at a restaurant or sports event, then surprise him by waiting until you get there to reveal that you asked them along.  If your boyfriend has a strong relationship with his parents, reach out to them and include them in your plan. It'll be pretty impressive and demonstrate that you're in this relationship for the long haul.   It doesn't have to be a big party. Invite them over one evening during the week for dinner, or ask if he'd like to have dinner over there some night. It might be a relief for him that you're willing and interested.  

throw the party somewhere else.  secure the refreshments.  forget about decorations.  don't give him any hints.  get his friends in on it.  do something with his family. 

 The first thing you need to do is take a long, hard look at what factors led up to the breakup. Consider whether these same difficulties are likely to cause more relationship problems if you try to get back together, or if you might be able to get past them.It's important to think about what you might have done to cause the breakup. Blaming your ex for everything is not a great way to get him back!; , Breakups are never easy, even when the relationship was not a good fit. For this reason, it's crucial to think about your motives for wanting to get your boyfriend back. If you want to get back together because you are sad or lonely or don't like being single, you should probably reconsider. Just because you miss your ex does not mean you should be with him. These feelings will go away eventually, although it may take some time. If you want to get back together because you genuinely care for your ex and you can see yourself having a future with him, then go ahead and try to get him back!If your boyfriend was physically, emotionally, or verbally abusive in any way, you should not try to get back together with him. It's perfectly normal for you to miss him even if it was an unhealthy relationship, but it's important to remind yourself that you can do better.  Because the end of a relationship is often tumultuous, it's best to give both yourself and your ex some time away from each other before you try to patch things up. You both need to be able to get over the initial pain of the breakup and think about what you really want.This doesn't mean you need to completely shun him if you go to school together or have mutual friends, but avoid calling him or hanging out with him for a little while so that you both have the chance to heal and gather your thoughts. If your ex contacts you a lot, let him know that you're going to give him some time so he doesn't think you don't want anything to do with him. This is especially important if the guy you love is a bit shy or insecure. He may need some time to realize how much he misses you too!  , When attempting to get an ex-boyfriend back, you need to realize that it may work out, but it may not. Even if you successfully get your ex back, there's no telling that your relationship will end up lasting. Prepare yourself for this beforehand to avoid being blindsided by heartbreak a second time.  Take this opportunity to really invest in yourself and work on loving yourself. The better your self-esteem, the better prepared you will be to have a healthy, long-lasting relationship.If you suffer from depression or anxiety, see a mental health professional for help. You may be surprised what an impact treatment will have on your self-esteem. Remind yourself of your strengths and talents every day. Celebrate every accomplishment you make, no matter how small. If you have a hard time recognizing your own strengths, talk to your friends and loved ones. Ask them to share with you what they think your most positive traits are. Try to be thankful for all that you have. Meditation can help you reduce stress and live more soundly in the moment.  If you have mutual friends or if his friends would be willing to talk to you without telling your ex about it, consider asking them what they think the chances are that your ex would want to get back together with you. They are more likely than you to know if he has a new girlfriend or if he's dying to get back together with you.This is not fool-proof by any means. He might still want to get back together with you even if he hasn't expressed that to his friends.  When you're ready to start spending time with your ex-boyfriend again, casually ask if he'd like to do something as friends, like having a drink, attending a sporting event, playing a game you both like, seeing a movie, or hanging out at the mall. Act like a friend, not a girlfriend.Don't use this as an opportunity to start begging him to take you back. Instead, try to have a good time with him and make sure he has a great time with you. Don't talk about your relationship the first time you see him, unless he brings it up first. Otherwise, wait until you've spent time together a few times and have had the chance to make a good impression on him as a friend.  While spending time with your ex as friends, give him reasons to remember all of the things he loves about you. Accentuate the traits you know he loves, like your sense of humor or your empathy.Always be positive and happy when you're around him. You can drop subtle hints along the way that you're still interested in him. For example, you could say, "It's great to hang out with you. I really missed spending time with you." Even if you don't bring up your past relationship directly, you can remind him of the good times you shared together in subtle ways. If he complimented a particular outfit, wear it again. You could also share a light-hearted memory with him. If you have a chance to meet him, do it in a familiar place where you used to enjoy good times together.  Take advantage of your time together as friends to show him how you've been working on improving yourself. For example, if it used to drive him crazy that you were always late, make a point of showing up for your outing a few minutes early., Unfortunately, there's no surefire way to know if your ex-boyfriend wants to get back together with you without asking him. When you feel you've had enough time to show him the new and improved you, have an honest conversation with him, letting him know that you still have feelings for him.   Be sure to ask your ex if he still has feelings for you too before you start gushing about wanting to get back together. If he doesn't, there's not much you can do about it. Don't cry or beg. Don't let this conversation become an argument about why you broke up. It's important to show him that you've moved past that. Have the conversation in a quiet place where you won't be interrupted.  If your ex-boyfriend takes you back, you both need to take steps to make sure that the same problems that caused your last breakup will not interfere with your relationship again. Talk to each other about what kinds of conflicts you have had in the past and how you could deal with them more appropriately going forward.Depending on how serious you and your boyfriend are, you might want to go to couples counseling to improve your relationship skills.  Now is the time to scrutinize your behaviors that led to the breakup and to try to self-improve. For example, if you feel that you and your ex broke up because you are too jealous or argumentative, try being more conscious of these behaviors and stopping them in their tracks.Depending on what bad habits you are trying to rid yourself of, you might benefit from the help of a mental health professional. Keep in mind that this does not mean you should change who you are. If your personalities are incompatible, it's probably best to look for a new boyfriend who appreciates you for you. If, however, you have some bad habits that you can address, go ahead and work on them. You don't need to change for anyone else! Any changes that you make should be made because they ultimately benefit you.  If you did anything at all to hurt your ex-boyfriend, whether you said something that offended him or you weren't there for him in a time of need, it's time to apologize. It takes great strength to offer a sincere apology, but it will go a long way in helping you repair your relationship.Be specific about what you are sorry for. Instead of saying, "I'm sorry for hurting you," say, "I'm sorry for not returning your calls." This will help convince him that you have genuinely put some thought into the things you have to be sorry for. Tell your ex why you did what you did and let him know what you have learned from the experience.  If you and your ex broke up because you were unfaithful, you face the daunting task of convincing him that you will not cheat again. The exact way that you confront the issue should depend on why you cheated in the first place, but regardless of the reason, it's important to be open and honest with him.If you cheated because you were unhappy in the relationship or felt that something was missing, be honest about what happened and what you would like to do to make sure it doesn't happen again. If you cheated because you thought you had genuine feelings for the other person but you really didn't, let your ex-boyfriend know how wrong you were and tell him what you've learned. If you are a compulsive cheater and are unsure of what motivates you, show your commitment by seeking professional psychiatric counseling. If you cheated to get revenge or teach your ex-boyfriend a lesson, tell him that you realize how immature that was and that you've learned how important it is to deal with conflicts like an adult.  If you and your boyfriend broke up because you weren't able to make your long distance relationship work, don't give up hope! Long distance relationships are hard, but it is possible to make them work if you stay strong and give your partner the attention he needs.   Commit to regular conversations, and make sure you are open and honest with your partner at all times. If you can't be physically close to him, it's even more important to work on communication.Fill your partner in on even the most mundane aspects of your daily life, and encourage him to do the same. This will help you feel like you are a part of the other's world.Try your hardest not to let the distance cause you to become insecure about your relationship, as these doubts can cause the relationship to fail., Are you really still in love with him? If so, it might be worth trying to get him back, by showing him you still care and that you believe things will be better this time. Sometimes breaking up provides time for both people to realize that, more than anything, they just want to be together again. However, if you have any other reason for wanting your ex back, reexamine whether it's a good idea to try to rekindle the relationship.   For example, if you want him back because you feel lonely without him, that's not a good enough reason to get back together. The lonely feeling will pass with time. Or if you want him back because you feel jealous thinking of him with someone else, think again before you decide to try to get back together. Post-breakup jealousy is normal, and this, too, will pass.  If your ex boyfriend has started dating someone else, consider him off-limits. Don't become that person who won't leave her ex alone after he has moved on. If he's happy with someone else, you could end up hurting him, his new partner, and yourself by trying to interfere.  It might feel temporarily lonely or even boring to be on your own after the end of a tumultuous relationship, but try to ride that feeling out instead of going back to your ex. On again, off again relationships tend to be based on unhealthy patterns that won't go away. Resist the temptation to jump right back in when you know you're better off without him.  

reflect on why the breakup happened.  think about why you want him back.  take some time.  accept that it might not work out.  build your self-esteem.  talk to his friends.  initiate contact.  be the person he fell in love with.  show him you've changed.  have an open discussion.  commit to having a better relationship.  correct bad habits.  apologize if you hurt him.  prove that you're faithful.  work on long distance issues.  make sure you want your ex boyfriend back for the right reasons.  think twice if he's already in another relationship.  stop trying to get your ex back if the relationship was toxic or abusive.

 Too much brightness can wash out a picture as too much flash. Just like adding white paint to any color on a painting the same thing can happen to pictures when using flash and changing the exposure higher. At their worst the whole picture will be a white square.   However lowering of the exposure can be used to reduce the washing out of colors in pictures when the flash is used. You can also experiment with different flash speeds on your camera depending on your model and type your using. Also experiment with varying amounts of exposure and make note which ones work the best. Too low exposure can be just as bad as too much. Many underexposed photographs are dull grayed out and lifeless. When dealing with items with light, whether it's a firework video or a light up skyscraper, keep your exposure low to avoid the "light flare blur". Also when dealing with sunsets and sky photos lowering the exposure keeps the details of clouds and the landscape clear and pushes the sky nicely into the background. The same goes for any reflective or metallic surfaces. Adjust shooting scenes with lowest exposure first and adjust the exposure higher to figure out. Flash can also do amazingly strange things for some pictures. Try it in a dark landscape picture and the little minute details of the clouds in the sky become very clear as well as the gradients of brightness in the sky. Low exposure flash pictures with lots of adjusting or experimenting can lead to amazing pictures with sharp detail. Flash can also cause the very common culprits in photography as well. In portraits using the wrong flash or using it incorrectly can cause the dreaded red eye. Flash can also kill critical details in textural, macro photography as well.  

beware how flash and exposure affects colors in the picture.

Remember that having a diagnosis can be a good thing. It allows you to find useful treatments, and some people may find that it gives them closure. Borderline personality disorder is just a name. It does not define who you are or what you are worth. You are still the same person who you were before. Now you just have one more piece of information about yourself.  It’s normal to have various emotions after receiving a mental health diagnosis. You may feel relief, shock, denial, shame, confusion, or powerless.Don’t be ashamed of how you feel, but let yourself feel these emotions as completely valid and okay. Recognize that it’s normal to have many emotions about a diagnosis and allow yourself to feel them as they occur.   You may fear having to tell people or facing social stigma of mental illness or personality disorders. Don’t get too far ahead into the details now, and instead, focus on what you feel and how you feel it. If you feel sad, note where in your body you feel that sadness and express it however you see fit. If you want to cry, journal, or just listen to your feelings, that’s okay.  Borderline personality disorder is not a disease or a marker of a “bad” person. It’s simply a category of similar symptoms from people who tend to have a trauma history. Yes, knowing that many people with BPD have a trauma history can help you cope with feelings of shame and enable you to realize that this diagnosis is not your fault.Learn what symptoms are typical and how BPD affects those who have it.  Some people, media sources, and movies see those with BPD as scary, reckless, and as the most extreme cases. Not everyone with BPD has the most extreme case, and symptoms may vary from one person to another. If you read things on the internet or talk to people who make sweeping generalizations about people with BPD, take a step back or do not associate with them.Remind yourself that you are not borderline, but that you have a diagnosis of BPD, and that it doesn’t have to define you. Remember that you are still a unique person with unique skills, characteristics, and problems. A diagnosis can't change who you are. A diagnosis simply puts a name to your symptoms. While it might seem scary, the symptoms would exist with or without a diagnosis. Once you have a diagnosis, however, you can take steps towards healing.  Therapy is the main treatment used for borderline personality disorder. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) was specifically designed to treat borderline personality disorder and includes learning skills to manage your emotions more effectively.DBT uses four modules (mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotional regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness) to target specific characteristics of borderline personality disorder.DBT often has you working with an individual therapist as well as in group therapy. Group therapy can be very effective, so don't be afraid to try it out., If DBT doesn’t sound like a good fit, there are other approaches to treating BPD through therapy. Find a therapist and therapy approach that feels like a good fit.Therapies aimed to help BPD include schema therapy (which identifies unmet needs that have lead to negative patterns), Mentalization-based therapy (MBT) (which allows you to identify your thoughts and emotions and see them from a new perspective), and psychodynamic therapy (which helps you understand your emotions and interpersonal difficulties as reflected through the therapeutic relationship).When you find an approach and a therapist that seems like a fit, stay with it. Even if you go through a difficult period, try to work through the challenge. It is normal to struggle to sometimes.  If you experience acute or prolonged trauma, start treatment for the trauma right away. Some options to explore include eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), exposure therapy, somatic experiencing (SE), and trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy (TF-CBT). The trauma may affect your daily living, and for this reason, it’s important to address it up front.You may be able to resolve some of the emotional pain and work through deep wounds with trauma-focused therapy.  Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) often has a group therapy component. However, you may choose to attend group therapy for treatment in addition to individual treatment or to attend a support group. Being a part of a group can help you learn new skills and practice your skills in a safe environment.You can also benefit from reaching out to others with BPD and gaining insight from their experiences.   Call your local mental health clinic and community centers to see whether groups are offered for BPD.  If you feel like things are too much and you cannot take them and want an out, get help immediately. If you work with a mental health provider, contact him or her first. If you do not have a therapist, call your physician or go to the nearest emergency department. You can also call emergency services or a suicide helpline, such as 1-800-273-8255 in the USA.   Some signs of suicide include talking or thinking about killing yourself, selling your possessions, increasing alcohol or drug use, feeling like you have no purpose and are a burden to others, socially withdrawing, and acting reckless or out of control., Some people supplement therapy with medications. While there are no medications specifically designed for BPD, some symptoms can be addressed through pharmaceuticals. For example, if you suffer from mood swings, you may benefit from a mood stabilizer, and an antipsychotic can help with feelings of rage or disorganized thoughts.Talk to a psychiatrist about medication. Your psychiatrist will help you manage your symptoms through medication. Yet, be aware that you may try several prescriptions and experience side-effects before finding one that suits you. Medications will not cure you, but they can stabilize your mood so that therapy is more effective.  Find ways to help you deal with stress and cope better. Practice relaxation methods every day to help you manage your stress. Practicing for 30 minutes each day can help stabilize your moods.You can practice coping skills when stressors arise individually as well.   Start a mindfulness practice. First start with focusing on your breathing when you are feeling distressed or anxious. Turn your thoughts and emotions to focusing on each inhale and exhale to help you enter a calm space. For long-term methods, try engaging in a relaxation practice every day. Get into daily yoga, qigong, tai chi, and meditation. Find the one that appeals to you and do it every day.  It’s important to feel supported by the people in your life as you experience shock or any other strong emotions about your recent diagnosis. Being near people who love you and care about you can be important during this time. Surround yourself with family and close friends to support you. Talk to someone who will listen to you and be helpful during this time. Continue to use your social support throughout your treatment.   Build your social support from people who will listen to you and respect you., Especially after immediately receiving your diagnosis, you may feel out of sorts and need help from others to get back into a normal life. However, people may not know how to support you. If you have a need, be direct and kind about it. Use “I” statements to express your feelings and your needs.For example, you may say, “I don’t want advice, I just want someone to listen right now.” You can also say, “I am looking for advice and would appreciate some guidance about this.” Be honest with others about how you’re feeling and what you’re needing. Say, “It’s hard for me to take in all the information at once, and I feel really overwhelmed. I feel like I’m shutting down and need some help. Can you help me with household needs this week?”  , If you don’t feel supported by the people in your life, consider increasing your social circle with friends who care about you and whom you care about. It can be difficult to build friendships and find closeness with others. Yet, remind yourself that it’s important to have friends that will help you and support you through difficult times.   You can also engage in activities that interest you, such as hiking, boating, or woodworking. Find groups of other people who share similar interests as you and start attending meetings or events. Having something in common gives you an instant bond.Another great way to meet new people and make friends is through volunteering. Volunteer at your local spiritual community, mentor disadvantaged children, or take dogs for a walk at your local shelter. There are plenty of ways to get involved in your local community and give back. Check out How to Volunteer for more information.

 You should read your Bible twice a day, in the morning and in the evening. If you focus just on God for 5-10 minutes, it really helps. Try to find time to read a verse or two from the Bible, and concentrate on what God is saying in the those verses.; , Pray to him when you feel happy, sad, angry, scared, or just bored. Tell him your feelings and don't hold back on it. Not only are you strengthening your relationship with God, but it also really makes you feel better when you have someone to talk to.  If you have a conflict, even if it is something as simple as, "I wonder if I should eat this last slice of cake?" You should ask yourself if what Jesus would do in this conflict. So, Jesus would probably not take that last slice of cake, but let someone else have it.  A lot of times in our lives, we are tempted to do things we know we shouldn't do. Even though it's hard, the best thing to do is avoid it. Just walk away if the temptation is hard, and if it just keeps coming, pray to God to help lift your temptation, and find something to distract yourself. If someone is peer pressuring you to do something that isn't right, you should just tell them to stop, and walk away from it.  It doesn't matter what type of Christian you are. There is a church out there for you. Attend any services you can, and make sure you take notes on the sermon. Also, attending a Sunday School helps, too. Most churches have Sunday Schools for adults and kids.  

read your bible.  pray to god.  what would jesus do?,  avoid temptation.  go to church. 

 Watch series 1, 2, 3 and the 2016 christmas special "The Abominable Bride". If possible, also watch the pilot. In this way, you'll become knowledgeable about the whole story.; , They are so worth it, and you will pick up the little things you have missed in the series.

Seek out some Sherlock fans to converse with. Just a warning, tumblr is incredibly crazy. But also incredibly funny.   Talk with the fans. Make friends with the people who share the same passion. They'll know what you're talking about.  You could also get posters, print out fanart you like, or even draw something yourself.  The really hard fans cry most of the time there's news, maybe you don't want to get into it that deep.  The only downside about Sherlock. The dreaded wait.

 For best results, choose young, tender, growing stems of marjoram with small leaves.; ,, Wash the marjoram under cold, clean, running water.  Remove the leaves from the stems with your fingers. Discard the stems.  Chop the leaves with a sharp knife.  For best taste, you should add fresh marjoram to your dish near the end of cooking.  Store fresh marjoram in a glass of water in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Change the water each day.  

choose your marjoram.  snip off the stems with scissors.  ,  clean the marjoram.  separate the leaves and stems.  chop the leaves.  add marjoram to your cooking.  store any excess marjoram. 

 Zinc poisoning occurs when stomach acids break down the object or substance the cat consumed.This leads to vomiting within a few minutes to an hour after poisoning. Lethargy and/or depression usually occurs around the same time as broken down zinc enters the bloodstream., A poisoned cat will usually lose their appetite within a few hours of zinc absorption into the bloodstream. Look for anything out of the ordinary. If you notice fewer trips to the dry food bowl between meals, it could be a red flag. If your cat doesn't take an interest in their main meals, you should call the vet just to be safe., Jaundice might start to show up within a few hours to a few days after poisoning. This causes the skin, gums, and the whites of the cat's eyes to take on a yellow appearance. The gums could also begin to look pale up to a few days after poisoning., Look for orange-tinged fecal matter. Even if the stool is still solid, an orange appearance usually signals zinc poisoning. Urine can also turn orange as the body attempts to expel the excess zinc. You should also check for soft stool or evidence of diarrhea., On average, healthy cats take 16 to 40 breaths per minute. If they're sleeping or resting, this rate should be on the lower end of the range. On the other hand, cats suffering from zinc poisoning breathe at a more rapid rate than normal. Another sign for concern is if your cat is breathing through their mouth. Healthy cats don't breathe with their mouths open.To calculate your cat's breathing rate, count the number of times your cat's chest rises (inhaling) or falls (exhaling) in 15 seconds. Multiply that number by four. Don't count both rising and falling, as this will give you an inaccurate rate. , Healthy adult cats have an average resting heart rate of about 120-140 beats per minute (bpm). When they're active, it can go as high as 220. For kittens, a healthy heart rate runs between 220 and 260 bpm. If your cat is already lethargic and their heart rate is above 140 bpm (or 240 bpm for a kitten), call your vet immediately.To take your cat's pulse, place your index and middle fingers on the inside of either upper hind leg. Move your fingers slightly if you don't feel a pulse at first. Count the pulse the same way you calculate your own for 15 seconds. Multiply that number by four., Your vet will provide most or all of the treatment in the office or at the hospital. Expect your cat to stay at the vet's office/hospital for a few days. The vet will have to order tests, remove the source of zinc from your cat's body, and administer medication. As long as you catch the symptoms early—preferably within the first few hours of poisoning and before any organ damage has occurred—your cat will have a good chance of survival., Your vet will provide most, if not all, of your cat's treatment. However, if the vet prescribes medication, follow their instructions to the letter. Make sure you give your cat the full course of the prescription. Medications can include antibiotics (especially if your cat had to have surgery), others to reduce the cat's heart rate, anti-seizure medications, and others to protect the gastrointestinal tract., In some cases of zinc poisoning, the zinc object must be surgically removed from the digestive system. Afterward, the vet will fit your cat with an Elizabethan collar to prevent them from licking or pulling the stitches. Keep the collar on until the stitches are removed. You might have to apply topical ointment to prevent infection and/or speed up healing. Finally, you'll also have to check the stitches several times a day for swelling, blood, or other seepage from the wound., Your vet will need to monitor your cat to check the prognosis of the healing process. Work with your vet to make a check-up schedule and keep every appointment. Once your cat has a clean bill of health, your vet will let you know., If the lock or fastener on your cat crate is metal, assume that it could contain zinc. Go to your local pet supply store or search online for plastic replacements to the lock. Follow the replacement instructions on the packaging., Never leave coins, especially pennies minted in 1982 or later, lying within reach of your cat. Clean up nuts, bolts, nails, and screws after you're finished using them. Replace all metal board game pieces after the game is over. Bottom line: if it's metal, assume it contains zinc. Stow away any metal jewelry and stash staples in a drawer or cabinet that your cat can't open., Read the list of ingredients on your hand and body lotions. Look for zinc or compounds containing it, such as zinc oxide. If you use creams for diaper rash or sunburn, zinc oxide is a likely ingredient. Lock these up in a medicine cabinet that your cat can't access. Reinforce the cabinet doors with child-safe locks, if necessary., These products often contain zinc. Place them in the medicine cabinet with the diaper rash cream or buy them in child-proof bottles. Always replace the caps on your vitamin and supplement bottles. If you use a pill sorter, make sure the lid is secure. 

look for vomiting and low energy.  monitor your cat's appetite.  check your cat's skin, eyes, and gums.  examine the contents of the litter box.  monitor your cat's breathing.  check you cat's heart rate.  take your cat to the vet or animal hospital.  administer the prescribed medication.  follow your vet's instructions on post-op care.  return to the vet for check-ups.  replace zinc locks on your pet carrier.  secure all loose metal objects.  lock up lotions and topical medications.  cat-proof your vitamins and immunity supplements. 

 Whether in the bathtub or the shower, you should allow your skin and hair to soften before shaving; this will improve the closeness of your shave. Some people suggest soaking in the tub for 15–20 minutes,but according to others just three minutes in the shower is enough to do the trick.   Try doing the rest of your bathing routine first—body cleansing, shampoo, and conditioner—then following with your shave at the end. This will allow maximum time for your skin to soften, regardless of whether you’re in the bath or shower.; , Hot water, though it might feel pleasant, dries out the skin and should be avoided.When showering or bathing, keep the water at a pleasant, moderate temperature.   Ice cold water should also be avoided, as this is very shocking to the skin.  This is a crucial step that will keep dead skin cells from clogging your razor. It’s sometimes tempting to pass on exfoliating, but you really should put in the effort before every shave.   Use a salt or sugar scrub from the store or online—you can find a great one at a variety of price points and in a variety of scents. Some good ones to try include Arbonne Awaken Sea Salt Scrub, Soap and Glory Flake Away Body Scrub, and St. Ives Smoothing Apricot Body Wash. You can easily make your own scrub at home. Try mixing together 1 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 1/2 cup of oil (olive, coconut, or baby oil work fine), and 3 tablespoons and lemon or lime juice.Exfoliation is also great for helping with in-grown hairs, which can be unsightly and ruin your best efforts at getting great skin on your legs., Use several soft upward strokes with a sharp razor instead of only a few firm ones. This way you’re less likely to cut yourself and you’ll be sure to get all of the little hairs.While it may seem easy to use body wash or soap since you’re using it on the rest of your body, these items will dry your skin.It’s best to use a product such as shaving cream or gel that is specifically formulated for the purpose of shaving your legs.This will help you get the smooth, glowing skin you’re after. Pay careful attention to how your hair grows. You should be shaving against the grain, and may need to shave up or down in certain areas depending on the direction of the follicles, in order to best remove the hair.  Cheap blades won’t get you a close shave. If your hair is fine and thin, you should do fine with a 3- or 4-blade razor, but coarse, thicker hair demands one with 5 blades. It’s also a good idea to use a razor with a built-in lubricant strip if your skin is sensitive Replace your razor frequently, anytime you notice a dull or corroded blade or that you’re not getting a good shave anymore. This will also help you to avoid cuts and unsanitary conditions.. Every three shaves is a good rule of thumb for replacing your razor., Waxing removes the root of the hair at the shaft, ensuring super smooth soft skin that lasts a lot longer than a shave does. You can wax at home with a kit from the drug store or you can get your legs waxed by a professional.   Waxing does hurt when it’s being done (though the pain is brief), so it’s not necessarily the best choice for those with very sensitive skin or who are averse to unnecessary pain.  Depilatory creams, lotions, and sprays are chemical products that dissolve the hair on the surface of your skin.You can use these pain-free items in the shower or the bathtub, and they are formulated to remain in place on your skin until you wipe them away with a washcloth.Depilatory creams have traditionally been known for their strong odor, but newer versions aren’t nearly as offensive as their old-school counterparts. Some even have a tropical smell! Because you’re not pulling the hair out at the root, you’ll need to use depilatory creams, etc., more frequently than you would if you were waxing., A more permanent solution for removing your leg hair is to get several (usually 3–5) laser treatments. These remove the hair from your legs by directing highly concentrated beams of light into the hair follicles.Laser hair removal is an expensive option, costing an average of $235 per session. Since it will take several sessions to see permanent results, it’s important to consider the overall cost when deciding on this route., As soon as you get out of the shower or bathtub, rub a thick lotion all over your legs. Try to do this while your legs are still a little bit wet (but not soaked), as the water will help lock in the moisture from the lotion.   Only moisturize after you shave, never before. Moisturizing before you shave will clog the pores and keep you from reaching all of the hair with your razor.Avoid lotions that contain alpha-hydroxy or alcohol, as these products can irritate skin that has just been shaven. If your skin is particularly dry or prone to eczema, you may want to try a thicker cream as opposed to a lotion. Good options include CeraVe Moisturizing Cream and Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream, both of which are easy to find in stores and online.  Although post-shave is the most important time to apply lotion, you will want to moisturize daily, especially if you go several days in between shaves. Try to get into a habit of doing it at the same time every day (at night or while getting dressed in the morning, for example) so that you don’t forget.   Although you want to moisturize frequently, don’t overdo it; too much lotion can lead to clogged pores. Once or twice a day is sufficient.  Before going to bed at night, massage olive oil into your legs, wait for the skin to absorb it, then rinse in the shower. This will leave your legs feeling silky soft! 

soak your legs.  use lukewarm water.  exfoliate your skin.  shave your legs gently.  choose the right blade.  wax your hair.  use depilatory products.  get laser treatments.  lotion right after you shave.  apply lotion frequently.  try olive oil. 

 Confronting past grievances in a face-to-face meeting can help bridge old rifts and improve communication. If you have ongoing conflict and you’re a tight-knit family, you might even want to arrange a standing weekly or biweekly family meeting where everyone gets together to talk. This will help to keep everyone abreast of current issues and give everyone the opportunity to express themselves.Many families are dispersed across wide-ranging geographical boundaries, so getting together in person can be a somewhat rare occurrence. It may be necessary to talk over the phone or video chat. Even if the next such occurrence is a few months away, you can use the intervening time to organize your thoughts and plan your peaceful confrontation. If the only time your family gets together is the holidays, try not to use this as a time to work out your problems. People put a lot of expectations of magic of the holidays, and they can become more emotional and irrational when they feel that their holidays are ruined and become resentful of whomever they feel is responsible. Also, it can make people start to dread the holidays, as they come to associate them with stress and fighting. Reserve the holidays for savoring family time and find another time to talk about serious issues.; , Since the conflicts you’re addressing are deeply personal, discussions can get heated quickly. Excessive emotion can derail the conversation and make it almost impossible to reach a productive resolution, so you should try to keep things calm and controlled. Do this by establishing a general code of conduct which forbids certain destructive behaviors, such as interrupting, bringing up unrelated quarrels, and name-calling.It can be helpful to enlist the input of the other party in formulating these rules so they don't feel like you are just parenting or lecturing them. Regulating the discussion can be easier if you have a disinterested party like a family friend or level-headed relative to mediate your discussion.If you have a big family but your lingering resentment involves just one or two other family members, you’ll probably want to carve out a special appointment or time when just the aggrieved parties (and potentially a mediator) can meet and talk. This will avoid unnecessary interference from well-meaning relatives.  You might assume that everyone in the family knows how much you love them, but this isn’t necessarily true. In fact, people often feel neglected when love isn’t expressly articulated, so you should make sure to say it often, especially during an argument which addresses old wounds.So, when explaining your side of the story, make sure to do so with explicit declarations of love and affection. A good way to do this is bringing up positive memories and good times you’ve shared throughout the discussion. You’ll be amazed how quickly these feel-good throwbacks will get everyone smiling and feeling closer.   For example, preface a statement about how you've been hurt with, "I love you, and the reason I'm bringing this up is because our relationship is so valuable to me."  , You won’t make any progress in your confrontation if you use the time when others are speaking to plan upcoming responses. Rather, you should be listening to others’ feelings and words with an open and empathetic mind. Practice active listening by asking questions when you need clarification and repeating key points back to the person to ensure you understand. This way you show you’re attentive and genuinely concerned with understanding them.You can also give small feedback gestures like nodding, leaning in, and light touches on the arm in order to make your interlocutor feel attended to. You might say something like, "What I'm hearing you say is... Is that right?"  , Perhaps the most important part of healing interpersonal conflict is coming to a mutual, explicit consensus that you’re all going to make an effort to move forward. This agreement shifts the emphasis of old wounds to the future: you’re all acknowledging the hurtful past while also recognizing that this past cannot be changed. The only things you can control are your actions and words going forward, so say something at the conclusion like, "Now that we've talked about this, let's agree to let this issue go and concentrate on improving our future behavior and relationship."It can help to write out a list or “contract” of behaviors and words you both agree to avoid or follow in the future. Things like “no passive aggressive texts,” “everyone must extend invitations to all family events—no petty exclusions!” and “no venting to mutual friends or family members” can help to remind everyone not to slip back into old habits and aggressions. Remember, too, that no one is perfect, and it can be hard to change ingrained behaviors. Forgive people when they slip up.  Moving forward, strive to speak or write to one another more frequently. This small effort will keep lines of communication open and allow you to remind one another how much you care. It will also boost your psychological well-being and amplify your sense of satisfaction from unrelated aspects of life such as your career and friendships.This communication can be a brief text every few days saying, “Hi, how are you?” or “Thinking of you!” You could also tag each other in social media pictures or memes, such as a #TBT photo on Instagram, or set up a ten-minute weekly phone call. It's important to emphasize taking an interest in the other person and asking about their life, not just sharing your own information, to show that you truly care about them.  

find a time to meet in person.  establish ground rules for the discussion.  express yourself with love.  listen to each other.  agree to move on.  stay in touch. 

 Begin using the cup at one meal per day once the child is familiar with the cup. This may occur at eight to ten months old. Then, replace your baby's bottle at other meals. Do this until all meals are eaten with a sippy cup instead of a bottle.   Start with meals in the middle of the day and with snacks. Work on one feeding at a time. Don't rush, but be sure to always make progress. Offer your child a sippy cup instead of a bottle during other times of the day such as nap time and snack time preparation. Children are less likely to give up feeding habits first thing in the morning and right before bed. These are times when a child is likely to seek comfort.For weaning the night time bottle, have a bedtime ritual in place such as a warm bath, a story, and a favorite toy. This can help reduce the stress of losing the bottle.  Going back and forth between the bottle and sippy cup during meals will only confuse the child. Continually diminish the presence of the bottle. Keep track of how frequently your child uses a bottle.  

give the baby a sippy cup instead of a bottle during mealtime.  remain consistent during the weaning process. 

 While the designs of compasses are different, all compasses include a magnetized needle that orients itself to the magnetic fields in the Earth. The basic field compass, also sometimes called a baseplate compass, features the following simple components you should familiarize yourself with as soon as possible:   The baseplate is the clear, plastic plate on which the compass is embedded. The direction of travel arrow is the arrow in the baseplate pointing away from the compass. The compass housing is the clear, plastic circle that houses the magnetized compass needle. The degree dial is the twistable dial surrounding the compass housing that displays all 360 degrees of the circle. The magnetic needle is the needle spinning within the compass housing. The orienting arrow is the non-magnetic arrow within the compass housing. The orienting lines are the lines within the compass housing that run parallel to the orienting arrow.  ; , Place the compass flat on your palm and your palm in front of your chest. This is the proper compass stance, when traveling. If you're consulting a map, place the map on a flat surface and place the compass on the map to get a more accurate reading.  For a quick basic exercise to orient yourself, it's good to find out which direction you're currently facing or traveling. Look at the magnetic needle. It should swing off to one side or another, unless you're facing North.           Turn the degree dial until the orienting arrow lines up with the magnetic arrow, pointing them both North, and then find the general direction you're facing by looking at the direction of travel arrow. If the direction of travel arrow is now between the N and the E, say, you're facing Northeast.  Find where the direction of travel arrow intersects with the degree dial. To take a more accurate reading, look closely at the degree markers on the compass. If it intersects at 23, you're facing 23 degrees Northeast.  While it might seem confusing that there are two kinds of "North," it's a basic distinction that you can learn quickly, and it's an essential piece of information to learn to use a compass properly.True North or Map North refers to the point at which all longitudinal lines meet on the map, at the North Pole. All maps are laid out the same, with True North at the top of the map. Unfortunately, because of slight variations in the magnetic field, your compass won't point to True North, it'll point to Magnetic North.  Magnetic North refers to the tilt of the magnetic field, about eleven degrees from the tilt of the Earth's axis, making the difference between True North and Magnetic North different by as many as 20 degrees in some places. Depending where you are on the surface of the Earth, you'll have to account for the Magnetic shift to get an accurate reading. While the difference may seem incidental, traveling just one degree off for the distance of a mile will have you about 100 feet (30.5 m) off track. Think of how off you'll be after ten or twenty miles. It's important to compensate by taking the declination into account.    , Declination refers to the amount by which North on your map and North on your compass differ at any given point, given the Earth's magnetic field. To make using the compass much easier, you can correct for declination by either adding or subtracting the declination amount from your bearing in degrees, depending on whether you're taking a bearing from a map or from your compass, and whether or not you're in an area with East declination or West declination.          In the US, the line of zero declination runs up through Alabama, Illinois, and Wisconsin, at a slight diagonal. East of that line, declination orients toward the West, meaning that Magnetic North is several degrees West of True North. West of that line, the opposite is true. Find out the declination in the area in which you'll be traveling so you can compensate for it. Say you take a bearing on your compass in an area with West declination. You'll add the number of degrees necessary to get the correct corresponding bearing on your map. In an area with East declination, you'll subtract.  When you're hiking around in the woods or in the field, it's good to periodically check your bearings to make sure you're going in the direction you intend. To do this, move the compass until the direction of travel arrow is pointing in the direction you've been traveling and will continue traveling. Unless you’re heading north, the magnetic needle will spin off to one side.          Twist the degree dial until the orienting arrow lines up with the north end of the magnetic needle. Once they're aligned, this will tell you where your direction of travel arrow is pointing. Take off local magnetic variation by twisting the degree dial the correct number of degrees to the left or right, depending on the declination. See where the direction of travel arrow lines up with the degree dial.  To do so, simply hold the compass in the proper stance, turn your body until the north end of the magnetic needle once again aligns with the orienting needle, and follow the direction of travel arrow. Check your compass as often as you need to, but be sure not to accidentally twist the degree dial from its current position.  To accurately follow the direction of travel arrow, look down at the arrow, then focus on a distant object like a tree, telephone pole, or other landmark, and use this as a guide. Don’t focus on anything too distant, like a mountain, as huge objects aren’t precise enough to navigate by accurately. Once you reach each guide point, use your compass to find another.   If visibility is limited and you cannot see any distant objects, use another member of your walking party (if applicable). Stand still, then ask them to walk away from you in the direction indicated by the direction of travel arrow. Call out to them to correct their direction as they walk. When they approach the edge of visibility, ask them to wait until you catch up. Repeat as necessary.  Place your map on a horizontal surface, then place the compass on the map so that the orienting arrow points to true north on the map. If you know your current position on the map, slide your compass around so that its edge passes through your current position, but its orienting arrow continues to point north.          Draw a line along the compass edge and through your current position. If you maintain this bearing, your path from your current position will be along the line you just drew on your map.  To find out which direction you need to travel to get somewhere, place the map on a horizontal surface and place your compass on the map. Using the edge of the compass as a ruler, place it so that it creates a line between your current position and where you intend to go.         Rotate the degree dial until the orienting arrow points to true north on the map. This will also align the compass’s orienting lines with the map’s north-south lines. Once the degree dial is in place, put the map away. In this case, you'll correct for declination by adding the appropriate number of degrees in areas with West declination, and subtracting in areas with East declination. This is the opposite of what you'll do when first taking your bearing from the compass, making this an important distinction.  Hold the compass horizontally in front of you with the direction of travel arrow pointing away from you. Use this arrow to guide you to your destination. Turn your body until the north end of the magnetic needle is aligned with the orienting needle, and you'll be properly oriented toward the destination on the map.  One of the most difficult and advanced things you can do with a compass, but one of the most important, is finding out where you are when you don't know your exact location on the map. By locating distinctive landmarks you can see on your map, ideally as widely spread around your field of view as possible, you can get yourself re-oriented.  Unless the landmark is north of you, the magnetic needle will spin off to one side. Twist the degree dial until the orienting arrow lines up with the north end of the magnetic needle. Once they are aligned, this will tell you where your direction of travel arrow is pointing. Correct for declination, depending on your area.  Place your map on a horizontal surface and then place the compass on the map so that the orienting arrow points to true north on the map. Then, slide your compass around so that its edge passes through the landmark on the map, while the orienting arrow continues to point north.  Draw a line along the compass' edge and through your approximate position. This is the first of three lines you will draw to find your position by forming a triangle with the other two landmarks.         Repeat this process for the other two landmarks. When you’re done, you will have three lines that form a triangle on your map. Your position is inside this triangle, the size of which depends on the accuracy of your bearings. More accurate bearings reduce the size of the triangle and, with lots of practice, you may get the lines to intersect at one point.  

understand the basic layout of the compass.  hold the compass correctly.  find out where you're facing.  understand the difference between "true" north and "magnetic" north.  learn to correct for declination.  gather your bearings to find out which direction you're headed.  continue moving in this direction.  focus on points in the distance.  transpose the direction of travel onto your map.  learn to take a bearing from the map.  use the new bearing to navigate.  choose three prominent landmarks that you can both see and find them on your map.  aim the direction of travel arrow at the first landmark.  transpose the direction of the landmark onto your map.  triangulate your position.

 If you are doing an activity that could cause you to injure your knees, such as a sport that could make you fall, then you should protect them before that happens. Wear knee pads whenever you are doing an activity that may involve a fall or pressure on your knees.   For example, volleyball players should use knee pads to protect their knees when they fall or dive for the ball.Knee pads can be useful for activities beyond sports. For example, if you like to spend a lot of time in your yard weeding, wear knee pads or use a cushioned pad to kneel on when you are on your knees.; , There are certain kinds of motions that can put a lot of pressure on your knees. Sudden movements or direct pressure on the front or back of the knee can strain and injure the knee. This is especially true if you have an existing injury or illness in the knee, such as osteoarthritis.This means that you should be careful when lifting heavy objects. Be careful that you do not rotate while lifting, as this uses your knee abnormally under extreme pressure. Also avoid using your knees in a way makes them overextend. For example, be especially careful when exercising that you do not hyperextend your knees.  Too much weight on knees can age them prematurely. Work on keeping your weight at an optimal level to ensure that your knees do not become painful and damaged.Losing weight helps to limit the stress placed on your knees. If you can limit that stress, your knees are likely to function much better over time.  For optimum joint health, it is a good idea to eat an anti-inflammatory diet.This diet simply focuses on eating foods that reduce inflammation and avoiding foods that promote inflammation.Foods that reduce inflammation include: fish, green vegetables, olive oil, fruit, and nuts. Foods that promote inflammation include: fried foods, soda, refined carbohydrates, fat, and processed meats.  If your knees bother you or if you are concerned about developing problems with them in the future, then talk to your doctor. There are lots of different things that you can do to protect and promote your knee health, and to relieve pain as well. Some options include:Wearing a knee brace to keep your knee properly aligned. Cortisone injections to reduce pain and inflammation in your knees. Over-the-counter pain medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Knee surgery to correct severe or ongoing knee pain.  

wear knee pads.  avoid movements that could injure your knees.  optimize your weight.  eat an anti-inflammatory diet.  ask your doctor about medications and other treatments. 

,, We are interested to know the angle x formed where the the two side c's meet. Thinking about it, the original triangle was made of 180 degrees with the angle on the right at the far end of b, called theta, and the other angle at the top of a, being 90 degrees minus theta, as all the angles total 180 degrees and we already have one 90 degree angle.  At the bottom, we have  theta, at the top left we have 90 degrees, and the top right we have 90 degrees minus theta.   The mystery angle x is 180 degrees. So theta + 90 degrees-theta + x = 180 degrees. Adding theta and negative theta gives us zero on the left, and subtracting 90 degrees from both sides leaves x equal to 90 degrees. So we have established that the mystery angle x = 90 degrees.  First, the formula for a trapezoid is A= the Height x (Base1 + Base 2)/2. The height is a+b and (Base1 + Base 2)/2 = 1/2(a + b). So that all equals 1/2 (a+b)^2.  We have the two smaller triangles at bottom and left, and those together equal 2*1/2(a*b), which just equals (a*b). Then we also have 1/2 c*c, or 1/2 c^2. So together we have the other formula for the area of the trapezoid equaling (a*b)+ 1/2 c^2.  1/2(a+b)^2=(a*b)+1/2 c^2. Now multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the 1/2's 2(1/2 (a+b)^2) = 2((a*b)+ 1/2 c^2.) which simplifies as (a+b)^2 = 2ab + c^2.  to obtain a^2 + b^2 = c^2, The Pythagorean Theorem!  ,, For more art charts and graphs, you might also want to click on Category:Microsoft Excel Imagery, Category:Mathematics, Category:Spreadsheets or Category:Graphics to view many Excel worksheets and charts where Trigonometry, Geometry and Calculus have been turned into Art, or simply click on the category as appears in the upper right white portion of this page, or at the bottom left of the page.  

construct a right triangle resting on side b with right angle to the left connected to upright and perpendicular side a, with side c connecting the endpoints of a and b.  ,br>;  ,  construct a similar triangle with side b now extending in a straight line from the original side a, then with side a parallel along the top to the bottom original side b, and side c connecting the endpoints of the new a and b.  ,  understand the goal.  transfer your angle knowledge to the upper new triangle.  look at the whole figure as a trapezoid in two ways.  look at the interior of the trapezoid and add up the areas, in order to set them equal to the formula just found.  set the two area formulas equal.  now expand the left hand square, which becomes a^2 + 2ab + b^2, and we see we can subtract 2ab from both sides of a^2 + 2ab + b^2, = 2ab + c^2.  finished!  ,  make use of helper articles when proceeding through this tutorial:  see the article create higher exponential powers geometrically for a list of articles related to excel, geometric and/or trigonometric art, charting/diagramming and algebraic formulation. 

 Often times over the years clothes can become piled up without you even realizing it. The first step to sort this all out is to get all of your clothes out from your dresser, closet, attic, and below your bed. Lay everything out, either across your floor, or on top of your bed. Begin to pair things together, based on color, size, and fabric.Once you have started to make categories, place each of your articles in select piles. Begin to match box and suitcase sizes. If you have a relatively small pile of specific articles, you can pair that pile with a smaller box. Some of the larger piles might have to be matched with a suitcase or larger box.; , This is the perfect time to try on some of the old in your closet that you haven't worn in ten years. Check the clothes for mildew, moth balls, flees, bedbugs, etc. Smell them to see if they have a musty scent. Determine whether or not they are outdated. After you search through your closet/cupboard, you should have a pile of outdated, outgrown, and worn out clothes to throw away.Run your fingernail overtop of the fabric. This will help loosen any bugs, or bedbug fecal matter (dried blood) which is present on your clothes. It is best to dispose of these clothes, especially if they are old and haven't been worn in a while. Donate clothing that is still in good shape and does not fit you or is not appropriate for the climate in your new home. Many people like to take clothes to Goodwill or homeless shelters. Throw out clothing that is torn, stained or too worn to wear in public. This is especially true when it comes to any old underwear and socks which have been crammed in your dresser drawer for many years.  You will probably not finish all of your unpacking on the first day of your move, so keep a small bag with a few changes of clothes that you can use when you first arrive at your new home. Remember to leave out an outfit for moving day as well, and include undergarments and socks.Pack the items you need upon arrival to your new home in a separate container. This could include not just clothes, but also toothbrushes, deodorant, hairspray, etc.  When you move, chances are you will have to move glassware, dishes, etc. Wrap these items in some of those clothes you were going to throw away. Find specific items which fit the shape and size of what you want to wrap. If there are elongated items you can place them in pants legs. If it is a wide plate you wish to wrap, place it in the body of a shirt.Carefully stack these items on top of one another, or side-to-side. Do not throw the items down and break them. You can also add extra layers of old clothes in between the items when you start packing them up. Add a shirt, or an extra pair of pants, in between the items. Pack your glasses or stemware in knee high socks.  If you are taking your dresser with you when you move, you can leave some of the items in the drawers. You should leave lightweight items like underwear, socks, t-shirts, etc., while taking out sweatpants, jeans, coats, etc. You then have the choice of taking your dresser as a whole or breaking it down into its component parts. Get people who are big, or who have upper body strength to move the dresser.If your drawers are generally loose, with no locking mechanism, it it best to remove the drawers. You will want to wrap each of the drawers separately, with a large container of plastic wrap. Go around the drawer in both directions, multiple times. Do this until the drawer has been completely wrapped, and all of the contents are secure. If you decide to take the dresser as a whole, you will want to secure the drawers. Take a bungee cord and wrap it all the way around the dresser, overtop of one of the drawers. Hook the two ends of the bungee cord. Then take more bungee cords and wrap it around the other drawers, all the way around the dresser. Safely secure the dresser in the moving van. You can either use bungee cords or lifting straps. Tightly wrap them around your dresser and secure them to the base/side of your truck (on the inside).  You will want to make sure your folds are neat and tight so that you can fit as many clothes into each of your boxes. The best way to fold them is inside out, that way the creases that ensue will be easier to get out when you unpack. Bundle wrapping is another great option if you don't mind getting your clothes slightly creased.For bundle wrapping, lay out a large piece of clothing on a clean surface like a table. This article of clothing could be a jacket, winter coat, large sweater. Lay clothes on top of the large article one by one. Start with the next largest size of clothes and work towards the middle, until you are laying down your smallest articles. Finally, take one end of the largest article on the bottom in your hands. Begin to roll until all of the clothes are wrapped tightly together in one bundle. You can add a scrunchy, or a few rubber bands over the bundle to keep it secure.  Like books, the weight of clothes can be greatly underestimated. Because of this, it is best to pack your clothes into many smaller boxes rather than a few large boxes. If not, the bottoms can fall out of the boxes, and they can be very hard to carry.When you are purchasing/borrowing boxes to use, try and get 12X12 inch boxes. Any larger than that can be hard to carry. Lift your boxes occasionally as you pack. This will give you a feel for how heavy they are getting and when to move onto a new box.  This is probably the cheapest way to move your clothes if you already own suitcases. Simply fold them neatly, placing them one over the other. Try to keep pants/shorts on the bottom of the suitcase, leaving room at the top for shirts and dresses.If you can, use suitcases with wheels. They will be much better to move, both into your moving vehicle, and into your new house. Be careful not to pack delicate garments tightly in a suitcase. You can either pack them loosely, or use another method of packing. Suitcases are best designed to transport t-shirts, jeans, and shorts, all of which can be ironed later on.  When you are trying to transport dress shirts, pants, dresses, etc. you need a way to keep them from getting wrinkled. Wardrobe boxes are tall, with handles on both sides, and are equipped with a hanging rack at the top. They allow you to hang your clothes on hangers, thereby not having to fold them. This way you also will have most of your clothes hangers packed as well, and put to good use.Find wardrobe boxes with a metal pole rather than the cardboard ones. Especially if you want to hang a lot of clothes in the box, the metal rack will hold up better over time, and can be reused later. Wardrobe boxes are rather expensive. If you can, limit their use. Only buy one or two, and only place your most precious articles in them.  Garbage bags are a cheap, easy way to protect your hanging clothes. Cut a hole at the bottom of a garbage bag with a pair of scissors; one large enough to get hangers through. Slide your clothes on hangers through the hole. Tie the bag in a knot at the bottom of your clothes, and secure the top with a zip-tie.Vacuum sealed bags are another great option. They are found pretty cheaply at most department stores and will provide you with a little extra space as you pack. Place your clothes in the vacuum sealed bags, either folded or laid flat, depending on the size of your bags. Seal the top of the bag off (usually come with a plastic zipper). Attach the hose of a vacuum cleaner to the bag and suck out the air. Once the excess air has been eliminated, you will now have fairly thin bags of clothes which can be packed in suitcases or boxes.  Each of the labels should have: season, size, type (clothes, jackets, coats, undergarments, etc.), who it belongs to, and where it is going in the new house. You can buy pre-made labels for moving, or use some labels from when you last wrapped Christmas packages. Taping a piece of paper onto the box is another great option. Make sure that you use enough tape to secure the label.Completely cover the labels in clear tape. This will protect it from rain damage if your boxes are left out in the rain. You will still be able to see the label clearly. Write the labels in a dark pen, or a magic marker. This way the label won't rub off in between when it is shipped.  This will prevent your clothes from getting dirty. Use shoeboxes to pack your shoes if you still have them. You can stack the shoeboxes on top of one another in a larger box.Stuff shoes with socks or paper to ensure they keep their form and do not get crushed if you are packing them without shoeboxes. This will also prevent them from scuffing one another. Alternate the position of your shoes in the boxes to save space.  If you are making a short move, there is no need to pack everything. For example, if you are only moving a few streets away, you can lay down your clothing, still on the hangers, in the backseat of your car. You can also be more lenient with how much you take at once. Only take a few boxes over at once. Take the clothes which you won't need anytime soon over to your new house first., Place all of the same types of materials in the same box. Whether it be silks, cottons, polyesters, wools, etc. Each type of fabric needs a different treatment, has a different thickness, and different susceptibilities to creasing. When you get to your new house, it will be much easier to sort out your clothes this way, and prioritize which ones need to come out first.Woolen fabrics are generally thicker, and less susceptible to creasing. To pack away these clothes, fold them like normal, and place them in one over the others. You might want to place a paper towel in between each of them so that they do not tangle and knot together. You might also consider getting a few extra boxes to accommodate the thickness of the fabric. Silks and cottons are thinner and easily creased. You can fold them and place them into boxes if you don't mind the creases. There is always the option to iron your clothes once you move into your new home. However, if you don't want them to get creased, you can place each of the articles on hangers, and drape a plastic clothing bag over top. Hang them in your moving vehicle when you get ready to move. Polyesters and other synthetics can be crammed into boxes. They are fairly thin and don't crease easily. Fold them up like any other normal clothes and place them in boxes one on top of the other.  You will not need those items right away, and you can mark the boxes and bags so that you unpack them last. For instance, if you moving in the beginning of summer, you can pack up your fall sweaters and winter coats from the start. If you are moving in the middle of January, pack away your short sleeve t-shirts and shorts.   If you are packing in one of those in between months, leave some clothes that you might use near the top of the box.Pack away your specialty clothes as well. This includes hiking clothes, swim trunks, etc. Chances are, before a big move, you will not be traveling to use these items.  In separate boxes pack summer, fall, winter, and spring clothes. Summer and spring clothes are generally lighter, and can be packed tightly together. These clothes are somewhat easier to crease, so you can leave a few special pieces on hangers. However, you need to remain efficient with your space, so choose wisely. Winter and fall clothes are thicker, and less likely to crease. You will need more boxes, but you won't need many hanger if at all.Make sure to label each box. You do not want to have to go searching through every single box to find what you need. Prioritize certain clothes depending on where you are planning on living. If you are moving up north, pack your winter clothes first. That way when you get there those boxes will be ready for you. If you are moving southward, pack your summer/spring clothes first.  Place all large items in one box, and smaller items in another. For example, pack your sweaters, jackets, coats, jeans, etc. in one box. Pack underwear, socks, gloves, earmuffs, leggings, etc. into a smaller box. Because you will be mixing and matching here, depending on size, make sure you write a clear label on the outside of your box about the contents.Maintain a list as you are packing to make writing the label that much easier. Combine this method with other methods. For example, pack together large items which are used solely during winter time. Smaller items which are all silk. This will make it much easier when it comes time to unpack.  Pack together all of your pants into one box. Gather together all of your underwear and place them in another. Have a separate box for only dress shirts. This method is designed for a quick moving time. If you are planning on having a longer move-in time, it is best to try one of the other methods which allow you to pack a wide array of clothes together in one box. 

lay out and sort your clothes.  get rid of unnecessary items.  put aside clothing you will need immediately.  use old clothing to package breakable items.  leave some items in your dresser drawers.  fold and/or bundle your clothes.  pack your clothes into small boxes.  use your luggage to transport your clothes.  utilize wardrobe boxes.  place your clothes in garbage, or vacuum sealed bags.  put labels on your boxes.  pack shoes separately from your clothing.  transport your clothing without packing.  group your clothes by material.  pack your out of season clothing first.  organize your clothes by season.  separate your clothes by size.  divide your clothes based on purpose. 

 (200 g) of mushrooms into a food processor, along with half a clove of garlic and 1/2 cup (20g) of parsley. Chop it in the food processor until the mushrooms are in small pieces.   The size of the chopped mushrooms depends upon personal preference. You can chop them very tiny or leave them in larger sizes. If you do not have a food processor, chop the mushrooms, parsley and garlic by hand.; , (29.6 ml) of butter or olive oil. You can also mix 1 tbsp. (14.8 ml) of butter with 1 tbsp. (14.8 ml) of olive oil for a more complex flavor. Cook until all the liquid has evaporated and the mushrooms are soft and dark colored.  (100 ml) of fresh cream. Add salt and pepper to taste. ,

 Some of the best options include, but are not limited to, Bridal White, Antique Silk, Kardinal, and Aalsmeer Gold. These rose bushes are hardy enough to withstand garden living, yet are still capable of producing longer stems if well maintained.; , Choosing the right location for your rose bush is essential to success. As a rule, select a spot where the roses will be out of direct sunlight. If necessary, create a shaded spot using a tarp or other human-made shelter placed above the bush.  Most rose bushes will initially produce several buds per stem, and you'll have to gently remove any additional buds in order to help your 1 long-stem rose grow larger. Take care as you snip during the pruning process to avoid damaging the main bud or the stem it sits on. When done properly, your stem should resemble those sold in florist shops.  Only the stem, leaves, and central or topmost bud should remain. Prune the branches carefully, so that you don't cut into the tender meat of the flower stem.  If you cannot find such a specific option, choose a humus fertilizer, which you can find at a local garden shop.   Follow the manufacturer's guidelines very carefully when applying the fertilizer to your roses. Using too little means you aren't feeding the roses enough and too much will burn the flowers and cause them to die.  Rose bushes and their blooms need at least 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.6 cm) of water every week, split up between waterings, to thrive. If you live in a hotter climate, you may need to water more frequently or in greater amounts. An ideal test is to check the soil your roses are planted in. If it's dry to the touch, your roses are thirsty.  This process keeps dust and dirt away from the flower and helps to moisturize the petals.  

plant rose varieties that are best suited to produce homegrown long-stem roses.  read the care instructions very carefully for the rose variety you select.  use garden shears to prune away all but the topmost bud on each stem of your rose bush.  use your shears to cut off any surrounding or supporting branches on each stem.  select a fertilizer specifically made for roses to nourish your flowers.  water the rose bushes every 2 days.  spray the buds with a misting bottle once they form, and continue to mist them every time you water. 

 If the rabbit is not showing signs of improvement, then call the vet and tell them you are having an emergency issue with your rabbit. If your regular veterinarian is not available, for instance the problem is occurring on a day the veterinary office is closed, then you should call an emergency veterinary office in your area.   Your veterinary office may ask you some questions about your rabbit's condition. Then the person on the phone should help you assess whether the rabbit needs to be seen.  If you need to transport the rabbit to a vet, keep cooling it as you go. Wrap the rabbit in a damp towel and have the air conditioning on in the car.   Transporting a rabbit with heat stroke, while continuing to try to cool it down, may require two people. However, if you don't have anyone to help, just keep the temperature in the car cool and give the rabbit access to cool water.  Act calmly and quietly. Some rabbit's can really sense stress and react physically to being stressed themselves. They have sensitive systems, so whatever you can do to keep them calm will help.   Petting your rabbit softly and covering its eyes may help to keep it calm., In cases of extreme heat stroke, it is necessary to provide cool intravenous fluids. This will allow the veterinarian to bring the rabbit's core temperature down.This is the best, and usually the only, treatment a veterinarian can provide for heat stroke.   Getting these fluids can also help vital organs that have started to shut down as a result of dehydration.  

get emergency veterinary treatment.  keep the rabbit cool while in transport.  avoid stressing the rabbit out further.  understand that emergency veterinary treatment usually entails further cooling. 

 Start Word and open the document by clicking "File" → "Open." Any document can be converted into a PowerPoint. Know that you will need to copy and paste in pictures by hand.; , In order for PowerPoint to know where to divide up slides, you need to divide up the information. In the line above each list, paragraph, or sentence you want as a separate slide, write a title for the slide, such as "First Quarter Numbers" or "Works Cited."   This will become the large, bolded text at the top of each PowerPoint slide.  Click on the "Home" tab in the upper left corner of Word. Along your toolbar at the top of the screen you should see a large box labeled "Styles." In it are several formatting examples labeled "Normal," "No Spacing," "Heading 1," etc.  You will have to format each title individually. The text will become large, bolded, and colored blue -- and PowerPoint will use this format to determine the slide titles.  Hit the "enter" key to put a space between every block of text that you want separated. Now, highlight the text and select "Heading 2" on the "Styles" menu. Your text will turn blue. Every individual line or paragraph will be a different bullet on your final slide.   Bulleted sections will remain in the same slide if they are formatted as "Heading 2."  , If you assign something to "Heading 3," it will appear indented to the right and on a separate line. The PowerPoint slide would appear like the following:   Text formatted with "Heading 2"  Text formatted with "Heading 3"    , Hit "Enter" before each new title. This creates the outline for PowerPoint. Each large, bolded line indicates a title and the small blue text underneath is the content of your slide. If there is a space, then another title, PowerPoint will separate this into a new slide.  Once you've set up the outline you can change the size, color, and font of your text, which will convert to PowerPoint. The text no longer needs to be blue or bolded -- it has already been coded for conversion to PowerPoint   If you delete the spaces between lines or try to add new text, it may not be formatted correctly, so always take this step last. Don't forget to save your document!  , PowerPoint will take your document and convert it automatically into slides. If you cannot see the "Send to PowerPoint" button:   Click on "File" → "Options" to open up the Options Window. Click "Quick Access Toolbar." Select "All Commands" under the "Choose Commands From:" menu. Scroll down through the alphabetically listed commands until you find "Send to Microsoft Powerpoint." Click to "Add > >" it. Click OK in the bottom right corner. Now, a small button will appear in the upper left corner of word that lets you send the document to PowerPoint.  Apply the finishing touches to your presentation, like slide animations, sounds, themes, or pictures.   Word will not automatically convert pictures for you -- you will have to manually copy and paste or insert them into your slides.  

open your document using microsoft word.  separate each "slide" with titles.  navigate to the "styles" menu.  highlight your titles and click "heading 1.",  format the slide content as "heading 2.",  add sub-bullets using "heading 3.",  separate each slide with a space.  customize your text if you'd like.  send the document to powerpoint using "file → "send to powerpoint.",  customize your presentation in powerpoint. 

 Remove the shiny, polished panel on the top of your PlayStation 4 console. Apply gentle downward pressure to this panel with both hands and slide it away from the center line of the console, until it clicks out of place.; , This is a round, Phillips head screw with the shapes of the PlayStation logo engraved on it.  Remove this screw and set it aside.   Notice the other Torx screws sprinkled around the hard drive bay, but do not mess with them  , Pull the existing drive out of the bay. Remove any Phillips head screws attaching the old drive to the enclosure before setting it aside.  There will be more screws keep the hard drive in the enclosure. Remove them to replace the hard drive.  Attach your new drive to the enclosure with the same screws you just removed.   The PS4 will support any SATAII drive of no greater thickness than 9.5mm with at least a 160GB capacity. However, it makes the most sense to replace the drive with one that is larger and/or faster than the factory drive.  Slide the enclosed drive into the bay on the side of your console. Ensure that the screw holes on the enclosure and the hard drive bay are aligned  , Insert the large, rounded Phillips head screw from step 2 into the aligned holes and screw it in tightly.  Replace the shiny black panel to the top of the console. Lay the panel over the exposed hardware so that it is just a couple of inches from the seam, and slide it towards the seam until it clicks back into place.  Be aware that in order for your new hard drive to work with the PS4, you must install the firmware. Since your system cannot connect to the internet without it, the best method for doing this is via a USB memory stick.  

remove the front panel.  locate the screw that attaches the console to the bay.  remove the screw.  remove the drive.  remove the old drive from the enclosure.  insert the new drive.  reinsert the drive.  reinsert the main screw.  replace the panel.  install the firmware. 

 If your cat is grinding its teeth, it most likely means that it is having some dental problems. This could be a loose or broken tooth, gum pain, ulcers, gingivitis, or a problem with its jaw.In response to the pain caused by these issues, a cat will often times grind its teeth.   Your veterinarian will ask you about your cat's symptoms and then give the cat an exam. The veterinarian may need to do some tests, such as an x-ray or a blood test, to find the cause of the pain if no cause is immediately evident. Some of these tests may require your cat to be anesthetized, which means it will be put under so that the cat is still during the x-rays.Other tests, such as blood tests, do not require this.; , If your cat's teeth pain is caused by irritated gums or periodontal disease, the first step in treating it is usually a thorough cleaning. This will eliminate all of the bacteria that is fueling the issues and will give your cat a dental fresh start.You may need to go to a veterinary dentist specialist to get this treatment. Deep cleaning a cat's teeth requires the cat to be anesthetized. As such, it will usually require a separate appointment and will take about an hour.Some groomers, pet stores, and veterinarians offer "anesthesia free" teeth cleaning. This is just a surface cleaning, is not thorough, and does not clean under the gum line, where bacteria can really take hold.  If your veterinarian is able to diagnose the dental problem that is causing your cat to grind its teeth, have it treated as soon as you can. The grinding is sign that your cat is in pain, so correcting its dental problems is the best way to alleviate that pain.If your cat is in severe pain, your veterinarian may give it a pain killer to make it feel better. This is just a temporary solution until the actual problem can be fixed. In most cases, if there is a problem with one of your cat's teeth, the veterinary dentist will remove it surgically. If the problem is in the cat's jaw alignment, includes a tumor, or includes a bone fracture, that will require a more invasive surgery to treat.  If all dental issues are ruled out, then teeth grinding may be caused by another illness. While this is rare, it is most often caused by dehydration, digestive problems, abdominal pain, or neurological issues. Your veterinarian will need to assess your cat's overall health and run tests to diagnose the problem.There are many possible causes for teeth grinding in cats. Once dental problems are ruled out, your veterinarian will probably need to start with some general blood tests. These will give the veterinarian a good place to start when looking for a non-dental cause.  In order to prevent many serious dental infections, have your cat's teeth looked at every year by a veterinarian. This will help to keep your cat's teeth in good condition and will hopefully allow you to catch any issues that are developing before they become serious and painful for the cat.During an annual exam the veterinarian will talk to you about what dental care you are giving the cat, as well as looking at the cats teeth closely. If the veterinarian decides that your cat needs a deep cleaning or x-rays, then that will be done during a follow up appointment.  If you are concerned about your cat's dental health, or your cat has a history of dental problems, it is worth your while to brush your cat's teeth daily. This is the single most important thing you can do for your cat's dental health between veterinary dental cleanings.This daily brushing removes excess food, plaque, and bacteria that can promote dental diseases, such as periodontal disease. You will need to acclimate your cat to teeth brushing. Begin by putting a small amount of cat tooth paste, which is not the same as human toothpaste, on your finger. Let your cat sniff it and lick it if it likes. Gradually transition in to rubbing the toothpaste on your cats teeth. Then, when the cat gets used to your finger in its mouth, then you can transition to a pet toothbrush. This process may take weeks, or months, to complete.  There are several brands of commercial cat food that have been proven to improve a cats dental health. This is done during chewing the food, which removes plaque and tarter from the teeth.These foods either have a design that cleans the teeth or they have a chemical ingredient that removes tartar. However, be sure to pick a food that is balanced for your cat nutritionally, in addition to fighting dental disease. Ask your veterinarian if you need advice about what specific food to feed your cat. Additionally, there is an additive for your cat's water that can be prescribed by your vet that will fight plaque and gingivitis. However, this additive can make your cat's water taste strange, so make sure your cat will drink it without fuss. 

take your cat in for a veterinary dental exam.  get your cat a professional teeth cleaning.  have dental problems treated.  rule out other causes.  get your cat an annual dental exam.  brush your cat's teeth daily.  feed a diet that promotes healthy teeth and gums. 

 In a personal statement, this section will be a little bit different, and will focus more on your personal views on diversity.   Instead of talking about customers or employees in general, talk about how you have encouraged diversity in the past or worked easily with a diverse group of people. Use your experiences to back up what you’re saying.  Nothing drives a point home like a personal anecdote. Use a story from your past to illustrate how committed you are to diversity.   For instance, maybe you started a gay-straight alliance when you were in high school because you saw gay friends being bullied.  Take some time to talk about what types of diversity you are committed to, just as in the organizational statement.   Do you oppose ageism, sexism, classism, and homophobia? Spell out in your diversity statement in positive statements, such as: “I believe that all people should be treated equally no matter what sex they are…”  , Show how you would use your experiences to embrace diversity in the future at the college or company.   Essentially, you want to convince your employer that you are committed to embracing all people. If you are applying for a teaching position, you can discuss how you would go about teaching diversity in the classroom. What types of lesson plans would you use to implement your positions?  

establish how you are committed to diversity.  use a story to illustrate your experiences with diversity.  clarify the specific types of diversity that you are committed to.  discuss how you are going to embrace diversity. 

 To create your own black nail polish, all you will need is a pan of black eyeshadow and some clear nail polish. Make sure that you choose a black color that you will like on your nails.If you want a matte black look, then go for a matte black nail polish. If you want something shimmery, then go for a shimmery black nail polish. Choose a clear or matte top coat for the nail polish. If you use a clear coat, then your black nail polish will be slightly shiny. If you choose a matte top coat, then your nail polish will be matte. You will also need a small container to mix your ingredients together and a stick to mix them with. Try using a Popsicle stick or a cuticle stick.; , When you are ready to start mixing, begin scraping the eyeshadow into your dish. You will need about one to two teaspoons. Use the Popsicle stick to scrape off the top layer of the eyeshadow.         You may want to get a special black eye shadow for the purpose of making your black nail polish, or at least use one that you will not mind breaking into pieces.  If you want to create a matte polish and you did not use a matte clear coat polish, then you can add a couple of teaspoons of corn flour. The corn flour will give the nail polish a matte effect.         If you want to add corn flour then add it to the dish now. Keep in mind that the corn flour might lighten the black color a bit. If you want a true black nail polish, then you may want to skip the corn flour.  Next, pour in the clear coat nail polish and begin mixing the nail polish in with the eyeshadow. Stir the mixture until there are no lumps and the color looks even. This might take a few minutes.  After you have combined the nail polish and eye shadow, it is ready to use! Transfer it into an empty nail polish bottle and try it out. You can use the clear coat nail polish bottle that you emptied to make the black nail polish.         You can use a small funnel or just pour slowly. Make sure that you leave a little space in the bottle for shaking the nail polish. You may not be able to fit all of the nail polish into the container. If there is any nail polish that will not fit, then you can sue it right away or just dispose of it.  

choose a black eyeshadow and clear nail polish.  scrape some of the eyeshadow into a dish.  add corn flour for a matte polish.  mix in the clear nail polish.  transfer your nail polish to the empty bottle. 

 Moisturizing before and after you shave will help prevent nicks and cuts from occurring in the first place.  Taking a warm shower before you shave or washing the area you are shaving with hot water for a few minutes prior to shaving will help keep the razor from dragging on your skin. This reduces the risk of nicks and cuts.This technique is called wet shaving. When you wet shave, use a gentle soap that won’t strip away your skin’s oils or dry out the skin, which makes shaving even more difficult. , Replacing your razor blade regularly will prevent the nicks and cuts that come from shaving with a dull razor. Changing your blade often will also prevent razor bumps and redness, and reduce the growth of bacteria that might lead to infections. Change your blades as soon they seem dull. When the razor drags on your skin or when it feels uncomfortable to shave, this is a good indicator you need to change the blade. Changing your razor after 5 to 10 shaves is one recommended timeline, but it depends on how often you use your razor.Gillette recently revealed that their razor cartridges are designed to last for five weeks., Although it might be tempting to try and save money and time, shaving dry or without gel or cream increases the likelihood of nicks and cuts. Use shaving gel or shaving cream so the razor will glide smoothly over your skin.   Hair conditioner also works well as a shave gel or cream, and can be less expensive depending on the brand. , Disposable razors with a single blade, while often more affordable, tend to drag on the skin, leading to nasty nicks and cuts.For a smoother shave, opt for a razor with more blades.  Most of us don’t bother to clean or dry our razor blade after using, but research suggests this increases longevity, and prevents the blade from getting dull, which usually results in bad cuts and nicks. Try these tricks to keep your razor clean and dry:Rinse your razor after use in clean, hot water. On a dry towel or a pair of jeans, wipe the razor in the opposite direction from shaving. This helps get rid of any hair or shaving cream residue that might dull the blades or result in a less than perfect shave. Lubricate the blades after use with olive oil or an oil that won’t irritate your skin. You can use a cotton swab to apply a thin layer of oil to the blade. Let the razor air dry, and store it away from water.  Handling your razor properly and avoiding a few common mistakes will help prolong the life of your blades. You should avoid:Pressing too hard on the razor, which wears the blade down but also increases the risk of nicks and cuts. Tapping the razor head against the sink or shower can damage the blade edges, shorten the blade’s life, and result in nicks and cuts.  If your current shaving method continues to cause irritating nicks and cuts, research and experiment with other razor options or other hair-removal methods.   To get a smoother shave without the nicks and cuts, many people are turning to more traditional shaving methods with double-edged (DE) razors or straight razors. 

moisturize the area before and after shaving.  have a warm shower before you shave.  replace your razor blade regularly.  avoid shaving dry.  ditch the single-blade disposable razor.  keep the razor clean and dry.  handle the razor properly.  consider using a different type of razor. 

 You can still be a “guardian angel” for an individual (or individuals) that you don’t see often through showing love and kindness. All of these things can make a positive difference in someone’s day-to-day life. Try something like:   Smile or hold the door open for someone. Say something optimistic to a person who seems down.  If someone that you don’t know seems to be having a difficult time physically or emotionally, kindly offer to help.The kindness of can mean a lot to a person in a difficult situation.   If you see someone in a crowded location who is struggling to carry their bags or possessions, offer to help them carry something. If you see someone walking in adverse weather conditions, stop your car and offer to give them a lift (if you feel safe doing so). If you see someone upset or crying in public, ask them, “Is everything alright?” and offer them a tissue. Always treat people with courtesy, and don’t presume that they will want your help. If you offer your assistance and someone declines, do not press the issue.  Rather than approaching random acts of kindness as an incidental, unplanned activity, make it a part of your daily (or weekly) routine. You don’t have to go out of your way to do this; simply show kindness to those in your life or who you meet.Talk to your co-workers and compliment them when they do a job well. Once a week, buy groceries for someone who needs the financial help, like a student or single parent.  

treat an individual with spontaneous kindness.  notice if a stranger is struggling.  form a routine of performing kindnesses.

 Your cover is the first thing that people see when they look at your book. It shouldn’t be off-putting, disturbing, or too comic and absurd. Even if your book is a very funny book, the cover needs to be professional looking. Remember that there’s a difference between professional and boring – your cover should be interesting and enticing, but it also needs to look composed and clean.   For example, if you want your cover to be a naked man running through a football field that is perfectly okay. You just have to find a professional way to show that. Maybe the picture is from behind and far up so that you can see an empty stadium and the entire field. This cover is interesting, professional and engaging. Avoid low quality pictures and sloppy fonts. Make sure that people can actually see your title. You don't want it to be fading into the background of your cover.; , You don’t need that much on your cover to make it interesting. Don’t choose a picture that is too busy or complicated. Remember, most people are just going to be glancing over books. Your book cover should pop without being too intricate. You also don’t need to use Photoshop or any other more serious editing software to make a good cover. You might just end up with a poorly photo shopped photo if you do that.  Everything from the text to the color scheme to the picture should act as an extension of your story. It doesn’t necessarily have to show a scene or character from the story, but it should match the general feeling that you want the reader to have while reading the book.  

be professional.  keep it simple.  complement the story with your cover.

Trees can only be planted on dirt or grass. Therefore, a tree farm cannot be in a nether, mesa, desert, or tundra biome.  Use fencing to enclose your farm area. Don't forget to build an entrance. Enclosing your farm will prevent hostile mobs from entering and make the farm look neater in general., Saplings are obtained by breaking leaf blocks with anything but shears. Trees won't always drop saplings, so remember, be patient if you need a large quantity of saplings., Place the saplings, so that there are at least 3 blocks between each sapling., If you would like to speed up this process, you can place bonemeal, gathered from bones of a skeleton, on the saplings., Chop down the trunk first with your axe, then break the leaves with anything but sheers to collect more saplings and other drops. Continue chopping down all the trunks and leaves., 

find a good spot to make a tree farm.  enclose the tree farm.  gather saplings.  plant the saplings.  wait until all of your trees have grown.  chop all of trees at once.repeat the planting and gathering steps to make an efficient tree farm. 

 Let them know how you’re doing and ask how they've been. Make an effort to write letters to members of your family that don’t have access to a computer or cell phone.   In your letter, ask your family member questions and encourage them to write back. Developing a handwritten correspondence with someone is a great way to bond, and taking the time to write out a letter each week shows that you care.  They’ll appreciate the extra effort you took to send them something in the mail. If you have any prints of photos you want them to have, make copies and put them in the card before you send it out.   Make a holiday card where the front is a photo of you with your spouse, kids, pets, etc. You can hire a professional photographer and use fun props to capture a memorable photo to use. Make your holiday card a tradition and send one out every year.  Send some food to your nephew starting college or package up a few goodies for your brother who just had surgery. You’ll likely get a call from them after they receive their package.   Include a traveling scrapbook in the package you send. Put some photos of your life in it and leave the rest of the pages blank. Have your family member add their own photos to the scrapbook and then pass it on to the next family member. Once it's full, you'll have a family scrapbook to look through when you're missing home.  

send your family members letters.  mail your family members cards for holidays and birthdays.  put together a care package for a family member in need. 

 If you've read up on SCD and believe it could provide you some relief from your symptoms, get advice from your doctor on whether SCD is right for you. SCD primarily works by starving bacteria in your intestines. If this is not the source of your digestive troubles, SCD may not work and could even damage your health.Although many people do lose weight on SCD, it is not a weight loss diet, and is not promoted as such. Rather, it's a healing diet that is designed to remedy digestive problems and help improve your digestive processes. Get advice from your doctor particularly if you have been diagnosed with a chronic digestive disease or disorder and are currently on prescription medication to treat it. The diet may interfere with your medication, or with other treatments.; , Since SCD is a trademarked system, it is essential to buy the book Breaking the Vicious Cycle: Intestinal Health Through Diet, by Dr. Elaine Gottschall, and read it all the way through at least once before starting the diet.You can buy the book online, or pick up a copy at most major bookstores. You also may be able to find a copy of the book at your local library. The official website for the book, www.breakingtheviciouscycle.info, has a list of places where the book is available for purchase. It's probably a good idea to read through the book once just to get a general idea of the diet and what it entails. Then, if you've decided you want to try it, go through it again and take notes.  The SCD is a strict diet plan that must be followed exactly if you expect to see any results. After you've read the book, go through your fridge and pantry and get rid of any foods that aren't allowed, so you won't be tempted.You can find a legal/illegal list online. You may want to print it up so you can use it as a guide while you go through your kitchen. Keep in mind that in addition to food, there also may be seasonings and spices that you'll need to avoid, especially during the first few weeks you're on the diet. If you live with other people who will not be following SCD, you may want to separate their foods from yours and keep them out of sight so you won't be tempted to eat them, especially in the first days when the diet is the most restrictive.  In addition to the official website associated with the book, there are numerous websites and blogs where you can find information about the SCD, including recipes and blogs that describe other people's experiences on the diet.There are some resources listed on the official website for the book, and also some testimonials. Another comprehensive online source for SCD information is www.scdiet.org, which includes links to support groups and detailed background information on SCD if you want to do more research before you commit. While you're deciding whether to start the diet, it's just as important to read negative experiences as it is to read positive ones. There is another book, Recipes for the Specific Carbohydrate Diet™, by Raman Prasad, that will come in handy once you complete the intro diet and start adding new foods. Many of these recipes are included on the website associated with the book, found at www.scdrecipe.com. You also may find helpful information on websites operated by nonprofit organizations and medical groups dedicated to assisting people with various digestive disorders.  The SCD requires you to make many of the things you'll be eating at home. It's typically more convenient to buy the necessary ingredients and make your basic foods in batches. Then you can refrigerate or freeze them and they'll be ready for you throughout the week.Go through the intro diet and the recipes included, and make your list. Focus on whole foods, because you'll have to prepare them specially. For example, you should get whole carrots and peel them yourself rather than buying carrot sticks or other prepared carrots. You'll need several bottles of pressed apple cider or grape juice, since these are the only drinks you're allowed during the intro diet apart from water. Look for large packages of chicken legs and thighs, since you'll need these to make your chicken soup.  Homemade yogurt is one of the staples of the SCD. Because the SCD starves the bad bacteria in your gut, yogurt is essential to introduce good bacteria to replace the harmful bacteria.You can make homemade yogurt in your oven without needing any special supplies other than a large pot and a thermometer. Pour one or two quarts (liters) of milk into the pot and heat to 180 degrees Fahrenheit (about 82 degrees Celsius). The milk must be heated to this temperature to sterilize it. You can use cow milk or goat milk. When you've heated the milk to the correct temperature, turn the heat off and allow it to cool to 70 degrees Fahrenheit (about 21 degrees Celsius). Stir it as it cools, covering it with a towel when not stirring it. If you want smoother yogurt, pour the cooled milk through a sieve to get rid of the skin that forms on the top of the milk. In a separate bowl, mix together some of the cooled milk with a cup of plain commercial yogurt. When you've blended it well (you can use a whisk or an electric hand mixer), add it back to the pot. Cover your pot and place it in the oven with a 60-watt light bulb. You'll need to keep a thermometer in the oven and make sure it stays between 100 and 110 degrees Fahrenheit (between 37.7 and 43.3 degrees Celsius). If it gets too hot, prop open the oven door. Allow the milk in the pot to ferment this way for 24 hours, and you'll have your homemade yogurt. Stir it until it's smooth, and refrigerate.  While you're on the intro diet, you'll be eating the SCD homemade chicken soup every day. You may find the intro chicken soup a bit bland, but you can add vegetables and spices to it once you get further into the diet.Put enough chicken thighs and legs into a large stew pot to fill it about halfway. You can use other parts of the chicken as well, but thighs and legs will make your broth more flavorful. Peel about 10 carrots and add them into the pot with the chicken, then fill the pot with water. You can season with salt to taste. Simmer your soup for about four hours, then strain it through a colander or strainer. Skim off the top layer of fat and you have your broth. Puree the carrots in a blender and return them to the broth.  The SCD is a healing diet, designed to starve the harmful bacteria in your gut and replace it with beneficial bacteria. In the first few days you begin the diet, you may experience severe cramping and diarrhea.During the first few days, you'll need to monitor the color and consistency of your stools. With the initial die-off of bacteria in your gut, your stools likely will change color several times over the course of the intro diet. You should follow the strict intro diet until you are producing healthy stools. The length of time this will take varies greatly from person to person. Some people only need to be on the intro diet for a couple of days, while others must follow it for as long as a week.  As you start adding new foods, you'll need to become very familiar with the SCD list of legal foods, and understand when you can start to add certain foods. Some should be added before others.The list is included in the book. You also can find searchable databases of legal/illegal foods so you can quickly find something in which you're interested rather than having to read through a whole list. You can find a browsable list on the book's official website, which is organized alphabetically.Look for your favorite foods, and mark or highlight them on the list so you know the earliest time you can add them and you can focus on adding the foods you like first. You also might want to look through some recipes and find some that you like. Check the ingredients and add those foods at the earliest point so your meals will have more variety.  Commercial juices and nut butters typically contain preservatives and sugars that aren't allowed on SCD. While you may be able to find organic, all-natural versions at specialty and health food stores, it typically is cheaper to make your own.Making your own juices also allows you to dilute the juice properly and ensure all pulp is removed, which is required by the SCD. Check the book for instructions on when you can start adding other juices and nut milks or nut butters to your diet. Generally speaking, you should wait until you've been on SCD for about three months to add nut milks, flours, and butters. The main reason to wait three months is so you can use a variety of nuts. Early in the SCD, you can only eat limited types of nuts. Introduce them slowly. With juices, you can add them whenever the book tells you that you can add that fruit. Follow the instructions in the book for making your juices, and make sure you aren't adding any sugar.  A food journal allows you to carefully monitor the food you eat as you follow the SCD. This is particularly important after you've completed the intro diet and start to add new foods.You may have a negative reaction that you don't immediately associate with the introduction of a new food, since symptoms may not occur right away. Your food journal will help you better make the connection. Also keep in mind that having "withdrawal" symptoms after eliminating certain types of food from your diet is not uncommon. Having a food journal can help you to distinguish these symptoms from a negative reaction to a new food. Certain substances in food, such as sugar and caffeine, can be addictive. If your diet included these substances you may want to taper off of them slowly before you start the SCD.  Even though you may see timeline-based suggestions, the SCD is based on how far along you are in the healing process. Your digestive health determines when you can introduce new foods, and how much you can introduce at a time.Keep in mind that the initial symptoms of bacterial die-off in your intestines can continue for as long as three weeks – even after you've transitioned beyond the intro diet and started introducing other foods. Include your observations in your food journal, so you know how your body is reacting to the specific foods you're eating and can determine when it is safe to add new foods. If you have a negative reaction such as diarrhea after introducing a new food, take that food off the menu and allow your system to adjust, then re-introduce it more slowly if it's something you like and want to be able to eat.  If you introduce several new foods at once and experience bad symptoms, you won't know which new food is the culprit. For this reason, you should leave a day or two between new food introductions so you can monitor your body's reaction.The SCD doesn't require you to add any new food at any time. You shouldn't add a food if you already have a known allergy or sensitivity to it. Keep in mind that with a healthier gut, you may have sensitivities to a particular food that you never noticed before. Even if you enjoyed a food before you started the SCD, you still should introduce it slowly in small amounts. If you notice a negative reaction after introducing a new food, take that food away and see if your system stabilizes. You can re-introduce the food more slowly if you want to have it in your diet, but you may want to wait a few weeks before doing so.  

talk to your doctor.  read the book.  clean out your kitchen.  locate resources on the internet.  get your groceries for the week.  make your homemade yogurt.  prepare several days' worth of chicken soup.  adhere to the menu strictly.  study the legal/illegal list.  make juices and nut butters at home.  keep a food journal.  observe your digestive system.  introduce new foods one at a time. 

 This is where Kenken gets its similarity to Sudoku. If you have a four square by four square grid, every single horizontal row must have a 1, 2, 3, and a 4 in it. The numbers, of course, can be in any order. This is true for each row.   If your grid is a six by six, you would have the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, without any repeating. If it is a 9x9, then 1-9, etc.; , A completed Kenken needs to have every single number in every single row and column, only once. Note, however, that this doesn't just mean you fill in every single box with your numbers and win -- each puzzle still requires a specific order -- as dictated by "cages."  , Inside of the Kenken, there are big, thick lines marking of several boxes at once, with a mathematical equation (ex. "3+," "1-," "2"). These are called cages, and they provide the puzzle and the solution. Make a note of them, making sure you understand what boxes they cover.   Cages can be straight, composed of either a single block or many at once, or L-shaped. Just follow the big, thick lines. Before beginning, make sure you can tell the edges of the each cage to prevent mistakes. Every box will be in a cage of some sort., If you have four numbers in a cage labeled "8+," then the four numbers in that cage must add up to eight, like 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 (note that this would be an L-shaped cage, otherwise you'd have two 2s in the same line!). So a cage with two boxes labeled "3-" would have to have two numbers that, when subtracted, equal 3, like 4 and 1. Every cage will have a goal -- and this is how you solve Ken Ken.   Kenken only contains addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (×), and division (÷).Cages with only one box and no mathematical symbol ("4") mean you just place the number in the box on its own. If the box just says "4," just put a 4 in the box.  If you have a box that asks for "2÷," you can answer it with either "4 | 2" or "2 | 4." You just need the two correct numbers in the equation -- the order doesn't matter., These rules all still apply no matter if you're playing a 4x4 or a 9x9. While the difficulty of the puzzle increases depending on the size, the actual rules and strategy for solving it do not.   If you're a beginner, start with 4x4 boards to get used to the system and strategy. Some papers even offer 3x3 grids for beginners too. 

fill in each horizontal row with the numbers 1-4, without repeating any of them.  fill each vertical column with every number, without repeating.  find and note the "cages," thick, irregular boxes within the kenken, to get clues to a solution.  know that the number and syllable at the top of each cage must be the "goal," or answer, of the written numbers put inside.  know that subtraction and division boxes can be in any order.  know that the same rules apply no matter how big the puzzle gets. 

 While any glass bottle can be turned into a water bong, some bottles are better than others. Bottles with a long neck and a wide base work best. Getting a clean, perfectly sized hole for the stem is easiest with a bottle that has little curve on the upper slope where the base connects into the stem., You'll need a 3/4" diamond drill bit to drill through the glass. Despite having the word "diamond" in the name, these usually only run for about eight to twelve dollars. You might have to order the bit online so make sure you don't leave this step for last., You'll want a 14mm glass bowl and downstem. Choosing the proper length for your downstem is important. Measure the distance from the upper curve of the body of your bottle to the opposite side of the base. Aquire a downstem approximately the same length, and definitely no longer.Glass downstems and bowls can be found at local head shops or ordered online. You'll need a rubber grommet with the following measurements: an outside diameter of 31/32", an inner diameter of 1/2", and a 3/4" groove. These can be found at supply stores like Home Depot, or can be found online.  Empty the bottle and wash it out with warm water. Warm water helps the drilling go smoothly. You're going to be drilling in the sink, so make sure that area is clear.  Remove any plastic that might be on the bottle. Find a spot on the bottle where the surface is relatively flat, somewhere on the upper curve of the body. Place the gasket there and use it to trace a circle with a sharpie., Attach the diamond drill bit to your drill. Be sure to use a battery powered drill, as you will be running water over the drilling area. Since there will be drilling and glass involved, it's a good idea to put on safety googles., To keep the glass cool and prevent it from breaking, turn on the faucet. You want more than just a trickle but not such a heavy stream that you can't see what you're doing. Hold the bottle so the water runs over the spot you marked., Set your drill to 3/4 of its max speed and gently push it against the marked spot. To get a steady drill, first angle the drill bit so it just touches the top of the spot. Slowly angle the drill bit until it's going into the glass at a 90 degree angle, using the carved out edge as a pivot. Once you're nearly through the glass, ease up on the pressure a bit to avoid cracking or breaking the bottle., Use the drill to smooth the edges of the hole. Pour out the water and rinse the bottle several times to clean out the bits of glass. The last thing you want is to inhale glass powder, so don't rush this step., Take your 3/4" grommet and work it into the hole. Then run some water over your downstem and slide it into the grommet, carefully, so you don't push the grommet into the bottle.Insert the bowl into the stem, and you've finished!  

pick your bottle.  get the proper drill bit.  aquire a downstem, bowl, and grommet.  clean the bottle.  mark a spot to drill.  prepare your tools.  get a steady stream of water over the drill spot.  start drilling slowly.  grind away sharp edges and clean out the glass.  put in the grommet, stem, and bowl.

 If you have lost 4 pounds or fewer, then you may want to consider staying in Induction longer.  If you are still having significant struggles with carbohydrate cravings, then you may want to continue Induction until those cravings are eliminated.  If you have high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea or a BMI of over 30, then you should consider staying on Induction for more rapid weight loss. Always follow the guidance of your doctor.  This will provide better nutrition and more variety. However, you should continue to eat less than 20 grams of carbohydrates each day.  You’ll add 5 daily carbohydrate grams each week until you notice your weight loss slowing. This will let you know how many carbohydrates you can eat while still losing weight.  Perform cardiovascular exercise and strength training as soon as you leave Induction so that you can lose weight more quickly.  

evaluate how much weight you have lost.  consider your cravings.  be honest about your health issues.  add 1 ounce of nuts or seeds if you decide to stay in induction.  progress to the owl phase when you’re ready.  start exercising. 

 An optometrist is a specialized professional who is the most qualified person to address your fears and concerns regarding contact lenses. She will be aware of issues such as dry eye, infections, pain or discomfort, and other potential pitfalls. The good news is, she also knows how to calm many of these fears and has solutions to protect your eyes from any serious disease. Make a list of fears and concerns to discuss during your visit. Ask for a free trial pair of contact lenses for practice. Request an eye exam. They are painless, a good idea, and good practice of what to expect next time you visit the optometrist. As an alternative, talk to friends or family members who wear contact lenses and ask them what their fears were and how they overcame them.; , Another important step to overcoming your fear of contact lenses is accessing the reason for the fear and finding out if it legitimate or not.Prior to ever wearing contact lenses, you might fear that something on your eye will cause pain or discomfort. Modern contact lens materials, however, are flexible, comfortable, and designed to properly fit your eyes. If you do experience pain or discomfort, talk to your optometrist about finding a more appropriate lens. A popular urban legend cites terrible damage or even death occurring because a contact lens slid up an eye and entered the brain. Biologically, this is impossible because eye anatomy only permits an object on the eye to be removed from the front. Eye infection is possible, but modern contact lenses, along with products that disinfect and protect them, makes it almost impossible to get an infection. If this still makes you nervous, then you might opt for daily disposable contacts so that you enjoy a brand new and clean lens every day.  Try to get used to touching your eyes by practicing for several days prior to purchasing lenses. Not only will you become more confident, your eyes will start to desensitize to objects near them. Always practice good hygiene by washing your hands thoroughly. Take your time. Begin by touching your upper and lower eyelids followed by your eyelashes, then the whites of your eyes. Gently tap your eye a few times to prove to yourself that there is nothing to fear.  Our natural reflexes try to prevent objects from entering the eye so a little practice to override this reflex may be in order. The key, of course, is to relax and try not to think about placing an object in your eyes; rather, you are placing a lens on top of your eyes. Practice not blinking by placing your index finger on the upper eyelid while your thumb is placed on the lower eyelid to hold open your eye. Take your other hand and imitate putting a lens on your eye so that your mind and eye get used to this motion. It is important to practice the same order repeatedly because contacts are designed specifically for an individual eye. This means they are not transferable from one eye to the other. The helper hand, the one that holds the eyelids open, needs to be steady in order to prevent blinking midstream.  It is not unusual to look away when inserting the contact lens. This helps prevent the fear of an object touching your eye. Using a mirror to insert contact lenses on your eyes will help take some sensation out of the process. Take your time and practice since looking into the mirror will reverse the image, making it a bit more difficult to skillfully locate where the lens should exactly go. Sit close to the mirror and concentrate on the process rather than the actual lens touching the eye. Then, when the lens is near the eye, look up slightly and place the lens on the white part of your eye. Carefully slide the contact into the correct position to finish the process. If the lens is not exactly in the right position, that's okay. Try closing your eye and then look up, down, left and right to position the lens in the right place.  

talk to an optometrist.  identify your fear.  perform a practice run.  practice not blinking.  look away. 

 Use purple foam if you want to make a violet, but other colors are fine if you'd like to make a different type of flower.  Cut evenly-spaced slits from the edge of the circle toward the middle, stopping about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) short of the center.  Lift each petal and cut an inverted "v" shape by making two diagonal cuts.  This will be the center of the flower.  Place a dab of hot glue in the center of the violet, then stick the small white circle to the glue.  Pinch each flower petal in half vertically, so they stand up a bit and created a 3-D effect, rather than lying flat.  Use a green pipe cleaner as the stem, and glue the top to the back of the flower's center.  

cut a circle from a purple piece of foam.  cut slits around the circle.  cut "v" shapes out of the petals.  cut a small circle out of white foam.  glue the circle to the center.  scrunch the flower petals.  glue the stem to the back of the flower. 

 You can make your own fez pattern with a little effort, but if you find it difficult to get the dimensions right or would rather save yourself the trouble, you can find a free pattern online and use that.   Print the pattern on standard printer paper. You can search for a pattern online. Search Pinterest or other similar sites.; , Use a cloth measuring tape to find the circumference of your head. Position the end of the measuring tape just below the curve of your skull, roughly 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) above the top of one ear. Wrap the tape around your head keeping it as parallel to the ground as possible while you work.Note that this measurement needs to be somewhat precise so that the hat sits snugly on your head, but also keep in mind that a measurement that is too tight will prevent the hat from sitting on your head at all., Once you know the circumference of your head, multiply it by 1.273. For example, if your head measurement was 21.5 inches multiply 21.5 by 1.273 to get 27.37. You can imagine the shape you are going to draw for the body of your fez as part of a giant perfect circle. If the circle was a pizza, the piece we are trying to make would be the crust of one slice. Since we only need part of it, we don't have to draw the whole circle, just figure out its radius. We do that by multiplying your head measurement by 1.273. In this case, the radius is 27.37. Next, cut a piece of string that is that length. In this example, you would cut a piece of string 27.37 inches long.Make sure you use something that won’t stretch a lot. Birthday ribbon is a good alternative if you don’t have any string or twine.  Before you start drawing your pattern, be sure to tape your paper down to the table or cutting board so that it doesn’t move around while you are working. One piece of scotch tape at each corner should be enough.Your best bet is to tape the paper down to a cutting board. This way it will stay secure after you draw your shape and be ready for you to cut it out right away.  The curved strip will form the side of your fez. The longest part of the curve will need to equal the circumference of your head plus an additional 1/2 inch seam allowance. Take the length of string you cut and hold one end of it on the table perpendicular to the paper. Tie a loop in the other end and slide a pen or pencil inside. Place the pen at one edge of the paper. The string should be stretched from the point on the table and run at an angle to the pen. Now, keeping the string taut, slide the pen like a pendulum across the paper, letting the string guide you. This will work like a homemade compass and allow you to make a perfect curve that will match the size of your head. Do the same thing for the top of the shape, making the second curved line 5 inches above the first.Make sure to keep the string tight while you draw your line or you’ll end up with an uneven shape. Keep your pen straight up and down while you draw. Tilting it will give you a distorted line.  On a standard piece of printing paper, draw a perfect circle with a radius of 2-5/8 inches (6.67 cm). The best way to do this is with a compass that you can buy at a place like Walgreens or Office Depot. Cut the circle out.   This pattern piece will be used for the top of the fez.  

print or draw a fez pattern.  measure your head.  cut some string.  tape your paper down.  draw a curved strip.  draw a circle. 

 Although many attorneys will write their own bios, you may be hired to do it for them. It is important to have a thorough understanding of their practice before beginning the bio.   Before meeting with the attorney, do preparatory research, such as looking at the attorney’s website, as well as performing web searches. Busy lawyers sometimes will forget past accomplishments or cases they have handled. With research, you can help draw this to their attention.; , Some attorneys market toward the general public. Others focus on selling their services to other attorneys or to corporations. Understanding the target audience will help drive what information to include.   For example, attorneys who market to other attorneys may want to include a long list of publications to establish their expertise. The general public may find this information boring or unhelpful. Be mindful that some of your pro bono work may alienate some potential clients. Corporations may not appreciate it if your pro bono work shows that your personal commitments run counter to their interests. Attorneys who market to the general public can include information about what community organizations they belong to.  An attorney bio should be part of a coherent advertising strategy and not a boring summary of someone’s life. Themes tend to focus on the attorney’s area of specialization: what the attorney can do for the client. Incorporate themes across the website. For example, a bankruptcy attorney may wish to give the firm a nickname, like “Debt Destroyers.” The attorney can then buy the URL for “debtdestroyer.com,” which will take visitors to the attorney’s website. Newer attorneys may not have chosen a specialty yet. Nevertheless, you can find commonalities across the cases the attorney has completed. A young attorney who has argued pretrial motions in a variety of cases can highlight her experience drafting legal documents and arguing in court.  An effective bio does more than use general language like, “I will fight for you” and “Your welfare is our business.” Instead, it includes specific information about the attorney’s practice. Concrete information answers the client’s question, “Can this attorney provide effective representation on my case?”   Mention cases the attorney has worked on. Include a brief summary of what the matter entailed, e.g., “Won jury verdict in slip-and-fall case.” Clients want to see that you have successfully resolved matters like their own. Highlight honors and recognition. These will increase confidence in the attorney’s skills. Prioritize honors gained as a practicing lawyer over those earned in law school. If the honor is mentioned in a newspaper article or on another website, link to it. Consider acquiring certification for any specialties and including those in your bio. Certifications typically require several years of expertise, professional recommendations from judges or fellow attorneys, and completion of additional education or tests. Certifications are valuable additions to your bio, however, because they demonstrate expertise in your chosen specialty. Include client testimonials. Websites such as Avvo now allow clients to post comments about their experience. A positive testimonial is the best referral an attorney can have.  Many people are intimidated by attorneys. Proper tone can convey that the attorney is approachable and easy to work with.   Use of technical jargon may impress fellow attorneys, but it can alienate the general public. Instead of using legal terms like "secured additur at trial," consider saying, "won increase in total compensation for client."  , An attorney bio is not a memoir. A reader should be able to scan it without being overwhelmed by information. A good length is under six paragraphs. Extensive bios can be broken up using hyperlinks. For example, the main page may highlight a few client testimonials and representative matters. Links can direct the visitor to a more comprehensive list of cases or testimonials.  A picture helps humanize the attorney. Make sure that it is a recent photograph.   Choose a photo depending on your audience. The general public will be drawn to casual photos, often showing you smiling. Many attorneys will also show themselves in casual clothing. Corporate counsel and other lawyers, however, may want a more formal portrait. Consider using a studio photograph in which you wear a business suit.  At the end of the bio, remind readers that the attorney is here for them. End with a statement like the following: “If you’ve been in an accident on the job, you may be entitled to compensation. Call the Law Offices of Attorney John J. Smith today for a free consultation.”  , Do a final check for grammatical and spelling errors. Nothing can undermine your professionalism like a typo!  , After the bio is online, do a quick scan to see how it fits on the page. Anything too blocky or visually unwieldy should be broken up so that the eye can move smoothly down the page.  Once you have published the bio on your webpage, don't just leave it there. Upload it to social media sites, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, and Google+. The more people who see it the better!  , Many attorneys have old bios on printed materials, such as brochures or flyers. Be sure to update this material with your new bio, including a recent photo.  As you handle new cases or receive new accolades, include them in your bio. Clients want to see that their attorney is active in the profession.  If your practice is changing, your bio should also. An attorney who has transitioned her practice from litigation to estate administration should have a bio that reflects her new specialty. Schedule some time every six months to consider whether the bio accurately reflects your current practice.  

meet with the attorney.  consider audience.  plan a theme.  provide concrete information.  write in a personable tone.  make it concise.  include an attorney photo.  close with a call to action.  proof the bio.  upload the bio.  share the bio widely.  replace old bios.  update the bio frequently.  rethink the bio every six months. 

 This is the starting point. Get it from the breeder or pet store. They should have a record.   If you don’t know the actual age and can’t find it, you could estimate the dog’s age by his or her teeth. By 8 weeks, dogs have all of their baby teeth. By 7 months, they have all permanent teeth, and their teeth are white and clean. By 3-5 years, you will see some tooth wear and tartar buildup. By 5-10, teeth show signs of disease. By 10-15, teeth are worn, with heavy tartar buildup and some are missing. A vet can also help you guess the dog’s age with a thorough physical examination. Older dogs often have cloudy eyes, gray hair, loose skin, and stiff legs.; , Some breeds live longer than other breeds do. This will help you understand how to put your dog’s age in context.   For example, Bulldogs live about 7 years and Great Danes live about 8.5 years. You can find charts listing life expectancy for all breeds online.Smaller dogs can live a lot longer. Miniature poodles can live up to 15 years. That’s about the highest age you will see a dog live to.  Small dogs are generally 20 pounds or less. Realize that the size and breed can matter. Small dogs usually live longer than large dogs do, although they might age more quickly in the first few years of life.   A large dog will probably reach middle age around the age of 5. Tiny dogs probably aren’t old until they are about age 10. Medium-sized dogs fall somewhere in between. Medium dogs range from 21-50 pounds, large dogs from 51-90 pounds, and giant dogs are generally over 90 pounds. This will matter when looking up online charts of dog ages, which sometimes break down the age estimates by dog size., The first and second years of your dog’s life equal about 10.5 human years for each year for a medium dog, 9 for a large dog and 12.5 for a small dog (a range of 18-25 that also depends on breed).   There aren't as many differences among breeds for the first few years. Basically, your dog is about 21 years old at age 2.Dogs reach full sexual maturation even after only a year in some cases. Smaller breeds mature faster than large breeds do., Every year after the first two years equals about 4 human years. You can find charts online that show the age estimate in human years for dogs.   People often mistakenly think that every dog year equals 7 human years but this discounts the complexity of the calculation. It varies by breed and size, as noted.Dogs age more quickly toward the front end of their lives and slower toward the end., You can find many of these on the Internet. Typically they all work the same way and will do an instant calculation of your dog’s age. This is probably the best way to know for sure because you can often narrow the calculation by breed and size.   These calculators usually ask you to select your dog’s age and then to select your dog’s breed. Hit “calculate” to learn the dog’s human age. Some calculators allow you to do this in reverse too: you can calculate your age in dog years. You're probably the equivalent of a giant dog!To give you a sense, at age 8, a small dog is roughly 48 in human years, a medium-sized dog is 51, and a large dog is 55. At age 10, the numbers are 56, 60, and 66. At 15, the numbers are 80, 87, and 120. , Regular checkups are necessary for dogs just like it is for human beings. Yes, it can be expensive, but if you want to have a dog, taking care of him or her is essential.   The vet will recommend regular vaccines and preventative care that can help a dog live longer. When you first buy the pet, take the pet to the vet for a thorough health screen., Dogs need exercise. They can’t get that if they are always sitting around. Try to take the dog for a walk once a day.   A good rule of thumb is to walk the dog for 20 minutes every day. Hey, it will also walk you, which can’t be a bad thing for your health, either. If you don’t have time to walk the dog, make sure he or she gets some time to at least run around the yard.  Obesity in dogs is associated with lower lifespans. So you might think you’re helping the dog by feeding him or her table scraps, but you’re not.   Research actually shows that a restricted calorie diet can help dogs live longer. Keep track of the calories your dog eats, including from pet treats, and ask the vet what the dog’s ideal weight is. Even eating 25 percent less can add 2 years to a dog’s life. It sounds counter intuitive, but you should be able to feel your dog’s ribs. Being lean is one of the key ways that dogs can live longer., Dogs are sensitive creatures, and there is evidence that they feel stress. They are loving creatures, usually, if you love them back.   Pet your dog, cuddle with him or her, and spend time with the dog. If the dog is a sociable breed, make sure that the dog has other dogs around for company, even if it means registering the dog in doggie daycare.  

figure out your dog’s birth date (or at least year).  research life expectancy dates by breed.  determine whether your dog is classified as small, medium, large or giant.  determine the dog’s age for its first two years.  calculate the rest of the dog’s age.  use an online dog age calculator.  take your dog to the vet.  walk the dog.  don’t overfeed your dog.  love your dog. 

 Be sure to add estimated measurements into each side's total to account for the overhangs. Mark these measurements on your diagram.  Add up the square feet you determined for each section. The sum of these numbers if your total square feet of the house, not the roof.  To calculate the square of a roof, take the number of square feet and divide it by 100.  The pitch is how steep the roof is. Pitch is calculated by the roof's rise over its run. Measure from the edge of the roof over 12 inches (12 is the run) and see how many inches up the roof line is (this is the rise). Get a slope multiplier from the chart below. Roof Pitch Slope Multiplier Chart: 2 in 12 = 1.102, 3 in 12 = 1.134, 4 in 12 = 1.159, 5 in 12 = 1.191, 6 in 12 = 1.230, 7 in 12 = 1.274, 8 in 12 = 1.322, 9 in 12 = 1.375, 10 in 12 = 1.432, 11 in 12 = 1.493, 12 in 12 = 1.554.  Take the ground level square figure you came up with and multiply it by the appropriate slope multiplier. This will give you your roof square.  

measure the four sides of the house from the ground using a measuring tape.  get the total square feet.  calculate the number of squares the house is.  determine the pitch of the roof.  get the final roof calculation. 

 To start a book you need to be out. Being out and about stimulates your mind and creates ideas you wouldn't be able to think about if you were sat at a desk. Whether you're on the train, on a walk or even talking to a friend. You might want to take a notebook with you wherever you go - take a very small one, as you never know when any phrases or titles may come up.; , A great many people start a book and think of the title later. Although this may work for some people, some think of a good title - purely randomly, and then know what the story is going to be about. For example if you think up the title 'Sophie's Life' or 'Fly Fishing' you're not going to write a book about a man called Steve who works at a garage. Titles tend to crop up at unusual times but keeping a note can be extremely helpful when it comes to getting a book started.  A lot of people make this mistake. By rushing to a computer as soon as you've thought of one thing will just end in disappointment when the idea doesn't get off the ground. Instead, write a plan down in a book, gathering ideas, characters and settings before you sit in front of a computer and type. Some of these are irrelevant if your book is non-fiction. Research is more important than thinking of characters if you intend to start, and stick to, writing a non-fiction book.  When you get to this step you should have a good idea about what you're going to write about. A lot of people say that the start is the most difficult part. Well if you follow the steps above, you should only be sitting in front of your computer when you've got notes, characters and general plot ideas. By this time you'll have so much to write about you won't fall at the first hurdle.  By this step you should be in full swing. The best way to stick to a book is again to go out! When you're out seeing sights and having fun - even if you're just going to work, it counts as being out - ideas will crop up in the most unusual places! Note down the ideas, and put them into the text you've already written when you are back by your computer. The best way to stick to a book is to keep an open eye out for ideas in general life. The best books contain people's thoughts, emotions and lifestyles, which you are seeing everyday.  You can wake up each morning with the choice of who you want to be today - and that is one of the best feelings in the world!  

go out.  consider your book title.  don't rush to the computer the first time you have an idea.  start to write!,  go out again.  remember that when you're writing, you can be who you want to be each day.

 Mostly this effect will be achieved from the use of foliage rather than flowers - few flowering plants have blooms prolific enough to provide the desired consistent result, although they can often be used in combination with the ornamental foliage plants as a contrast and highlight.; , The plants chosen should be healthy, strong-growers with a profusion of consistent color. Here is a selection of good plant varieties for creating a carpet bedding:    Coleus - in various shades of red, maroon, and scarlet, light and dark yellow, green and white, and other varieties.        Achyranthes - low-growing plants in mixtures of red, pink, yellow and green.        Centaurea gymnocarpa, "Dusty Miller," - with finely-cut foliage of a cool gray.        Alternatheras - similar to Achyranthes in habit, but with red as a predominating color. Both are excellent for working out the finer details of a design.        Pyrethrum, "Golden Feather" - with feathery foliage of a tawny yellow.        Geranium Madame Salleroi - with pale green and white foliage. This is an excellent plant for use in carpet-bedding because of its close, compact habit of growth, and its very symmetrical shape, which is retained throughout the entire season without shearing or pruning.  There are many possible layout designs. This step provides some examples that you might like to follow. Some of them may seem rather complicated, but when you get down to the business of actually laying them out, any possible complications should vanish in the doing. In laying out all but the star-shaped and circular beds, begin with a square as the basis to work from. Decide on the size of bed you propose to have, and then stake out a square as shown by the dotted lines in design No. 1, and work inside this square in filling in the details. If this is done, creating the carpet bedding will be much easier to achieve. In designing your layout, here are some ideas to inspire you:    Layout design 1 - easy to make, with many possible combinations and modifications. It is best to arrange the colors to suit your individual taste.        Layout design 2 - a division showing different spaces; a plain center with a plain point as shown in (a), shows the bed in its simplest form. In g, c, and d, these points have three different arrangements and the dotted line in the central portion indicates a change that can be made that will add considerably to the effectiveness of the design.        Layout design 3        Layout design 4        Layout design 5        Layout design 6        Layout design 7 - the simplest possible form of bed. This is designed for plants to be set in rows. In a bed of this kind, flowering plants can be used more effectively than in any of the others. Pink, white, and pale yellow Phlox would be very pretty in such a combination.        Layout design 8 - another very simple design. This design would be quite effective if each of the five sections were of a different color of Coleus. Or, the whole star might be of a solid color, with a border of contrasting color. Red Coleus with Madame Salleroi Geranium as a border would look well. So would yellow Coleus edged with Centaurea.  Before deciding on any color combinations, make a rough diagram of whatever bed layout you select and color this to correspond with the material you have to work with. Seeing these colors side by side on paper will give you a better idea of the general effect that will result from any of your proposed combinations than you can get in any other way, and will allow you to test them, helping to avoid making some serious mistakes. If you have a computer design program that you can use easily, this may be another helpful alternative. Here are some interesting combinations to consider:   Ageratum, with its delicate lavender-blue flowers, is very attractive in combination with yellow Coleus       A pink Geranium surrounded with gray Centaurea makes a harmonious combination       Scarlet Salvia is very effective with yellow Coleus       A Canna of rich, dark green makes a fine center plant for a bed in which red Coleus served as a background. One of the dark copper-colored varieties has a good effect if surrounded with either yellow Pyrethrum or gray Centaurea.  In setting these plants in the bed, be governed by the habit of each plant. Achyranthes and Alternathera, being the smallest, should be put about four inches apart. Give the Coleus about six inches of leeway, also the Centaurea. Allow eight inches for Madame Salleroi Geranium and Pyrethrum. These will soon meet in the row and form a solid line or mass of foliage.  Caring for the carpet bedding is a key element to its success.    Tend the bedding weekly - it is recommended to tend the bedding at least weekly to remove any straggling branches and leaves that are impacting the lines and colors of the design. Run your pruning shears along this line and ruthlessly cut away everything that is not where it belongs. If this is not done on a regular basis, your "pattern" will soon become blurred and indistinct. If any intermingling of colors "from across the line" is allowed, all sharpness of outline will be destroyed.        Keep plants clipped - clip frequently to keep the plants dwarf and compact. Make it a point to keep larger-growing plants, such as Coleus, Pyrethrum and Centaurea, under six inches in height rather than over it. Alternatheras and Achyranthes will need very little shearing, as to top, because of their habit of low growth.        Remove dead or dying leaves and branches - pick these up regularly to keep the design in good shape.        

bring out a pattern or design fully and clearly by using plants that are capable of providing a solid color effect.  select good quality foliage plants for creating the carpet bedding.  choose the layout design.  choose the color combination.  plant the plants.  care for the carpet bedding. 

 This will ensure that it's not smeared with fingerprints, and you'll have better accuracy when using the screen. Some of the older generation iTouches come with a cleaning cloth, but if yours did not, then a glasses cleaning cloth works just as well. To use either, just breathe on the screen, then rub till the fingerprints are gone.; , There are many different options for both of these items, for example with screen protectors you can get: clear, anti-glare, mirror and a few more. With cases, there are ones that just snap straight onto the back, and ones that you slip the iTouch into. Also, when buying a case, it is important to ensure that all buttons and ports (USB/audio jack) are exposed or at least can be used WITHOUT removing the case.  Otherwise, the screen will crack and you might get cut. Also, make sure you clean it more regularly, especially the screen, as your fingers are coming in direct contact of the screen.  don't leave it in the sun or attempt to cook it) Water/Extreme Temperatures + iPod Touch = iPod's Death.  If you keep it in your back pocket, there is the possibility of it either getting bent, or you sitting on it. And if it gets bumped, you could break the screen, scuff or even chip it.  You still need to take care of your earphones, as without these your iTouch is basically useless. Some tips on looking after your earphones are:   Don't wrap them around things tightly. Constant bending of the wire inside the plastic casing can snap it . Plus when you want the earphone's wire extended (eg. if you put the iTouch in your pocket and run the wire up under your shirt to your ears) then it will want to coil up. Don't leave knots in your earphones wire. Don't dunk your earphones in water or snow, and don't freeze them or let them over heat. Same as the iTouch, this will kill them. Don't have the volume up to loud! Not only is it bad for the earphones, it can also affect your hearing. Clean them. Sometimes your earphones will have earwax and stuff from your ears on them, not only is that gross but it's not good for the earphones. Just wipe it off with a soft cloth (being careful, of course, not to push it into the speakers).  

clean your ipod touch every day.  buy a screen protector and a case for your ipod touch.  make sure if you don't have a screen protector or a case, you don't drop it.  make sure it does not fall in water or snow, and that you do not freeze it or allow it to over heat (eg.  don't carry your ipod around in back pockets/places it can get bumped easily.  and don't forget your earphones! 

 You can use any text or image that is in your document.  If you're using Word 2003, use the Insert menu instead.  This will allow you to configure the blank message.  This will be the address that the reader will be sending the email to. What you enter into the "Subject" field will be automatically filled in for the reader, but they will be able to change it if they want.   If you use Outlook, you'll see recently used email addresses in the field at the bottom of the Window.  Once you've created the link, you can test it by holding Ctrl/⌘ Cmd and clicking it. Your email client should open with a new blank message addressed to the email address you set.  

highlight the text or click the image that you want to turn into an email link.  click the insert tab and select "hyperlink.",  select the "email address" option in the left menu.  enter the address and subject.  test the link. 

 They consume a lot of power.  Playing audio through the loudspeakers provided in the device consumes more battery power than hearing it through the headphones. 

avoid using the built-in loudspeakers.  use headphones when you can. 

 It is best to start out this process with one team. By narrowing it down to one, you can learn specific details about that team to make you seem more knowledgeable of football. After you learn the techniques, they can be used to increase your credibility among the fans of other teams in the future.; , More than likely, at least one of these specific players will have contributed to any given game. Knowing these names gives you a way to participate in conversations, without actually having to know the plays that were made. Talking about the players, though in a vague way, will make it seem as if you saw the plays they made.  These can really come in handy during conversation, or during a game. Learn words like “touchdown”, “first down”, “field goal”, “pass interference”, etc. You don’t need to understand these terms, just know the words. If you hear these things said by the announcer during a game, remember them.  You can use the names and key phrases you’ve learned, without having to understand the plays that occurred during a game. Using phrases like, “Wasn’t that interception awesome?”, or “Wow, what a game for Thompson”, you give the impression that you understand, when in fact, you only know small details like names.  A good way to avoid any possible slip ups is by doing the asking yourself. Use questions like “What did you think of that play?” or “How did you think the game was going to turn out?”. Asking questions gives you the control, and helps you avoid talking about things you don’t understand.  Remember the details of this one play, and it can take you a long way. This is always a good conversation turner. If things start to go down a path you don’t understand, you’re asked a hard question, or maybe you’re at a loss for something to talk about, just revert back to that one play. If it was a good play, chances are other fans will want to talk about it.  Though you may not know what is going on down on the field, the people around you probably do. One of the easiest ways to pretend you understand is to do what the people around you do. If those around you cheer a play, cheer with them. If they yell angrily, do the same. The key to this step is to cheer and yell even louder than the other fans. Make your motions really exaggerated and animated, giving the impression that what just happened has greatly affected you. This makes people believe you are paying attention and know exactly what is going on.  

choose a football team to follow.  learn the names and numbers of some of the star players on the team.  learn a few key football phrases.  keep conversations vague.  ask questions using the things you’ve learned.  remember one big play that happened in a game.  feed off the other fans, mimicking their reactions. 

 If you find out someone has been practicing mind games on you, or someone you know, and has done it well, figure out what made that person so successful. Study their mannerisms and words to figure out their technique.  Be sure to study the person you are trying to play a mind game with, so that you know how that person thinks. This will allow you to take the best approach for getting this person to take part in your game.  A lot of people are easily responsive to emotional situations and hardships. For sympathetic and empathetic people, you will want to play to their emotions by having them feel bad for you. This will lead them into helping you however you say you need it., This tactic requires you to gain the sympathy of the other person. You need to act like you are a perfect, moral person who keeps being victimized by the evils of the world, and you just don't know why. This will make someone feel obligated to give in to any requests you may have.   Simply pretend to be ignorant, and say, “I just don’t know what I keep doing wrong. Why do bad things keep happening to me?" Pretend like you are genuinely confused as to why things never work out for you.  When you know that someone is sensitive to guilt, be sure to play on that weakness. Guilt can weigh very heavy on a lot of people, and they will do their best to avoid that feeling. When you go to ask for a favor that someone may not want to do, you can attempt to guilt trip that person into doing it. Here are some things you can say if someone turns you down:   "I knew you would let me down." "I am not surprised that you won't do it, I am used to it.", If you find someone who goes by fact, and does not believe in something unless there is evidence to back it up, then you need more than emotions to mess with this person. Figure out a way to back up what you say with reason or logical benefits to be more convincing.For example, if you want someone to eat more healthy, explain how unhealthy food leads to health problems, and that vegetables can add years to your life. This may convince someone to healthier foods. 

study other manipulators.  practice reading people.  watch for emotionally driven people.  play the victim.  look for guilt-ridden people.  be aware of logically minded people. 

 You may think this step is crazy, but it's true. If you're wearing a blue goalie pinnie, and your team's colour is blue, you won't be allowed to wear that pinnie in play. This is because the referee can't easily tell who can pick up the ball, and neither can the other team. This gives you an unfair advantage, which is why it is illegal. So pick a colour that's very different from your team's.; , A goalie pinnie shouldn't be like another layer. It should just be a light garment. You can get a heavier one for the winter, and a lighter one for this summer, because this helps some people.  Many pinnies have padding on the side of the arms, but many don't. If you dive a lot, you should get this handy padding. If you don't, it's not as recommended that you get it. But if you are planning on learning soon, you should get the padding.  During winter, it is recommended that you get a fitting pinnie. During summer, you may want a slightly looser pinnie. You can also change the length of the pinnie if you'd prefer a longer shirt.  Pinnies can be long sleeved or t-shirt style. You should choose according to the season and the weather. If you'd like, you could even get one of each; one for warm days, and one for cold days. This way, you'll never be caught off guard.  

choose a colour other than your team's.  make sure it's light.  check the padding.  check the size.  choose a style. 

 The sooner you accept that it’s normal, healthy, and absolutely necessary for a flourishing relationship, the better it’ll be for the both of you.   If things have been reaching the breaking point in your relationship, try letting the situation go for a while. Don’t try to control what he's doing or fixate on what you're not getting out of the relationship; when you let things be, they often have a way of fixing themselves. Realize that your boyfriend is more likely to break up with you if you keep breathing down his neck than if you give him the space he craves.; , Without appearing paranoid or hysterical, be forthright in asking your boyfriend what he sees as being given space, and how much time he’d like.   Don't assume the worst; if he still gives signs of caring about you and wanting to see you, keeping your cool is the best thing you can do. Perhaps he's stressed from a heavy workload or snowed under with exam studies. Remember, it might not even be about you. When he gives his reasons, reward him with your trust. This may force you to examine your own motives for being with him; if it's out of love, you should feel this trust, but if it's for security, money, confidence, etc., you should take some time re-examine your relationship.  Does he want a few days or weeks right away, or does he want a permanent schedule change, such as having every Saturday to himself?   Visualize yourself as a person negotiating something perfectly reasonable; then, go ahead and negotiate it without extra baggage. Don’t beg. There is no harm in occasionally asking him for help, extra time together, or an indication of your future direction together, but begging is extremely childish and unattractive. Whatever you do, don’t walk off in a huff or throw a fit. Both reactions are calculated to have him retreat even further into his shell, making him feel justified in wanting more space!  , Feeling lost when he asks for space is a good indication that you need it as much as he does – if not more so. Use this time to contemplate your life and emotional state. Become the strong, confident, and independent woman you’ve always wanted to be; you don't need him to ensure your peace and happiness.   Plan fun activities like Friday nights with your girlfriends. Enjoy the outdoors. Long walks, hikes, climbing, swimming, sailing, etc., will improve your mood considerably. Rediscover or uncover a new hobby. Reconnect with old friends. Become more involved in your career direction and work on getting a promotion. Change your hair color or wardrobe. Become new and improved! Keep healthy and fit; don't allow this time apart to become a reason for letting yourself go. Exercise will clear your mind, release pent-up anger, and boost your confidence. Remember, a confident woman with a sense of her own purpose is extremely attractive, so you'll be doing both of you a favor by remembering your own strength.  If you have any bad habits that have been keeping you from your true potential, this is the time to change them.  If you want the relationship to succeed, then love the space for the chances it provides you both.   Take time to rediscover each other. Making the relationship feel fresh and new is a great way to get back your momentum. When you allow your boyfriend the space to think, do the things he loves, and be with his mates, he'll realize how much he misses you.  If a guy can be with someone who loves him for who he is, he'll thrive!   The more respect and freedom you give your boyfriend, the more he'll appreciate being with you in the first place. Be sure that he respects your choices and freedom right back; remember, your goal is to make the relationship more balanced, not just lopsided in the other direction.  Nurturing your relationship through healthy interaction will make you both feel happier and more secure.   Listen when he talks and don't interrupt. When you respond, stay positive and supportive. Keep a relaxed attitude. If you learn how to put him at ease, he'll soon start pouring out all of his thoughts and feelings. Remember, men need to feel safe too. Again, make sure he reciprocates. After all, being best friends is a two-way street!  , If you aren’t willing to honor your boyfriend’s need for space, he’s probably wise to ask you for it.   On the other hand, if you feel that your boyfriend is playing games with you, call him on it. If he isn’t willing to act like a mature adult, consider giving him space indefinitely.  Be happy and carefree, learn to love yourself as much as you love him, and find constructive ways to share time together and apart. Once you've got the balance sorted, you'll never look back.  

understand that it's okay to give your boyfriend space.  ask for clarification about what's going on.  work something out amicably.  spend time on yourself.  work on your own bad habits.  be patient.  respect his choices and his freedom.  be his best friend.  don’t turn this into a game.  relax and be the girl he fell in love with. 

; , Toss anything you don't need. If you need to keep papers, purchase a cheap file cabinet or box, and file them there. If the desk surface is large enough, frequently-used paper may go in baskets, binders, or racks on top.  A trash can is the ideal spot. A few objects that are meaningful or inspirational could occupy the back corners or hang on a nearby wall, but don't trade work area for trinkets. ,,, This can help to corral paper clips and other small items and still keep them handy. If your desk has drawers, though, take a good look at what's in them. If you don't need it for your work (pennies, loose screws, last year's birthday card), toss it!  ,, This is essential for writing at night. Consider getting a desk blotter. It will protect the desk from ink and offer a clean surface on which to write. Many desk blotters are printed with calendars, too, if you wish to track your schedule or progress.  

take everything off the top of your desk.  organize all papers into piles.  clear off the knick-knacks, too, and find a better place for them.  store your pens and pencils in a mug, or even better, a desk organizer.  ,  toss any pens or pencils that don't work, have been broken or chewed beyond recognition, or simply are uncomfortable or unpleasant to use.  ,  arrange paper, notebooks, wastebasket, and other frequently-used items within easy reach.  ,  buy a drawer organizer with many compartments.  replenish your supplies when necessary.  ,  get a good light for the top of your desk. 

 Use a squeegee, towel or cloth to dry all tiles after they get wet. Make sure you have a bathroom fan or window that can suck the excess moisture out from the air.   If you do not do this, grout will absorb excess moisture, which will turn into mold and mildew. It will stain and breakdown the structure of the grout, causing it to crumble prematurely. In extreme cases, the water and mold can get behind the grout and into the tiles.; , Many multipurpose surface cleaners are pH neutral, so check on the bottle before you buy and use it.   A neutral cleaner means that the pH, or "potential of hydrogen" is not acidic or alkali. The potential of hydrogen is judged on a scale of 0 to 14, with 0 to 6.9 being acidic, 7 being neutral, and 7.1 to 14 being alkali. Water is also neutral, at a pH level of 7.  The frequency of deep cleaning grout depends upon the amount of traffic the bathroom gets. Deep clean every month, if it is heavily used, with 1 of the 2 methods below.   Mix 1/2 cup of powdered oxygen bleach into a gallon of water. Use a spoon to stir it until it is completely dissolved. Pour the mixture all over your dry bathroom grout. Reapply after the solution soaks into the grout, or about every 15 minutes for vertical surfaces. After 30 minutes scrub the tile and grout with a nylon brush, or a toothbrush for an extra thorough cleaning. Rinse well with warm water and dry with a towel or squeegee. The more you reapply the oxygen bleach on your tile and scrub it, the cleaner your grout will become. Wet the surface of your bathroom tile. Fill an empty salt shaker with baking soda. Sprinkle baking soda generously all over the grout. Let it sit for 10 minutes and then scrub it with a nylon brush. Rinse well with warm water and dry immediately.  Make a paste with a small amount of water and apply it directly to the affected areas. Allow it to sit for 30 minutes. Scrub the grout with a toothbrush, and then rinse and dry it.  A penetrating sealer is important for bathroom grout, because it is absorbed into the grout's pores and protects it from mold and mildew. Some of these sealers can be expensive, but it is a good idea to choose based on quality rather than price.   Allow your tiles to dry. It will take approximately 5 days for the moisture behind the tiles to evaporate. Do not use your bathroom during this time. Apply the sealer to a sponge. Wipe it over the tile and grout of the entire bathroom surface you want to protect. Leave the sealer on for the time indicated by the product's directions. Wipe the excess sealer off the surface of the tile with a damp cloth or paper towels. The directions may suggest you use a pH neutral cleanser first and then rinse off the tile with a damp cloth. Apply a second coat, if it is recommended by the product. Allow the last coat of protective grout sealer to sit overnight before you use the bathroom.  

dry your bathroom after every shower or cleaning.  clean bathroom tile and grout weekly with a ph neutral cleaner.  clean the tile and grout occasionally with a mild alkali cleaner.  remove mold or mildew with a stronger oxygen bleach mixture.  seal bathroom grout with a latex penetrating sealer after installation, and again every year. 

 If possible, salt whatever unpleasant food you have to eat to excess. Once you've added enough, it should only be salt you taste when you have to take a bite. Avoid adding so much, however, that the excessive saltiness becomes just as unpleasant.In theory, you can do this with any spice (sugar included), though salt is usually always at hand and salting to excess rarely draws any attention.  Pour a bottle of peppermint extract into a small cap (like you'd find on a 24oz soda bottle). Toss the capful into your mouth. Swish it around as you would mouthwash. Spit out the extract and rinse your mouth with cold water. Your taste should be slightly numb for a number of minutes due to the menthol quality of the peppermint extract.   Spearmint extract will have the same menthol quality as peppermint and is an adequate replacement. If you have no extracts of the mint variety, you can also reach for over-powering tastes such as almond or chocolate extract. Coat your mouth in the same way (using only a capful) and whatever you eat next will take on the flavor of the extract.  If the flavors you're trying to avoid are in a liquid, use a straw so that you can bypass your tongue. Aim to have it land at the very back of your tongue so that it may go straight down your throat so as to avoid any contact with the taste buds on your tongue.   This is same logic can be used with food. Push whatever you're eating to the sides of your mouth and chew alongside your cheek so that the food cannot reach your tongue. Try and keep your head tilted back slightly to encourage your food/drink to leave your tongue quickly and continue down your throat.  With food or drink you do not want to taste, try eating it beforehand with food you like and following it with more. Try eating it quickly, but be careful not to choke or hurt yourself. The less time you allow whatever taste you're attempting to avoid to mingle with your taste buds, the less vulnerable you'll be to the unpleasant taste.  

over-salt your food.  make a peppermint mouthwash.  use a straw.  have better food on hand. 

 The vinegar mixture can be quite stinky and gives off an overwhelming odor, especially when used indoors. To avoid an uncomfortable situation, take your fog machine to an outdoor space when you want to clean it. This will be much better for you and anyone else who might be around.Try cleaning the fog machine in your backyard next to an outdoor electrical outlet. If you can’t find a space like this that works, consider cleaning it in your garage with the garage door open.; , Remove the tank from the machine. Unscrew the cap and dump the remaining fog liquid out in the sink. Make sure to empty it completely.   Don’t worry about rinsing the tank out after you dump it. The vinegar solution will work to clean the tank for you.  Using distilled water and distilled white vinegar, make a cleaning solution that is equal parts of each ingredient – half vinegar and half distilled water.   Be sure to use distilled water only, not tap water. Tap water contains minerals that can leave deposits inside your machine that will build up over time and cause problems later.  Put the tank back in the fog machine and pour the mixture of vinegar and distilled water into the opening. It should go into the same tank that is normally filled with fogging fluid.You’ll need to use enough of the mixture to thoroughly clean the machine. The tank should be mostly full. For most fog machines, this is probably about half a liter of the cleaning solution. Turn the machine on and let it run with the vinegar water mixture inside it.  Once you’ve run the vinegar and water mixture, you should pour some distilled water (not mixed with anything) into the fog machine and run it once like this. The water will help flush out any remaining vinegar smell inside the machine and will help clean it out a bit more.Let the machine air dry once you have finished this procedure.  Unplug your machine and allow it to cool down completely. Check the output nozzle (where the fog steam comes out of) for any deposits or debris. If you see something, use your fingernail or another firm object to scrape the opening of the nozzle.Additionally, you can try using a pin (or small needle) to clean out any remaining dirt. Move it in and out of the nozzle hold a few times to remove excess build up.  Use a damp cloth to wipe down the exterior of the fog machine. Be sure to get in all the nooks and crannies of the machine to clean off any dust or residue that may have built up over time.   Performing this kind of regular maintenance should prevent the machine from needing aggressive cleaning as often. It will also help prolong the life of your fog machine.  Once you have finished cleaning the fog machine, you can put some more fogger fluid in it to make sure it is working properly again. Let the machine run and produce fog for at least several minutes before you decide that it’s working the way you want it to.Never store (or stop using) a freshly cleaned fog machine without first running another batch of fogging liquid to make sure it works.  There are quite a few products available online for purchase that are intended for use in cleaning fog machines. Simply purchase the cleaning fluid and run it through your fog machine. Make sure to do the procedure outdoors so you don’t stink up the place with a chemically smell.Remember to always clean your fog machine before you store it.  Your fog machine should come with an owner’s manual that gives specific cleaning instructions. If you do some sort of cleaning routine that isn’t recommended by the manufacturer, it could void your product warranty.If the cleaning techniques don’t work, you may need to contact your manufacturer for a replacement, as long as your machine is still under warranty. So try not to do anything that may void the warranty.  Most fog machines don’t need to be cleaned regularly. In fact, fog machines typically don’t need to be cleaned at all unless you have been putting low quality fog liquid products in your fog machine – these lower quality products can cause the fog machine’s heater to clog.You definitely don’t need to clean your fog machine every year unless it starts exhibiting some symptoms indicating it needs a good cleaning. Cleaning a fog machine too often can cause it to stop working altogether.  The main sign that your fog machine needs to be cleaned is when you start noticing a significant decrease in output of the fog effect. If your machine isn’t producing fog as much as it used to, then it’s probably time for a cleaning.Since you don’t want to clean your fog machine too frequently, you should wait until you see a significant decrease in fog output – not just a small change.  If you use your fogger once a year (like at Halloween) and then put it away in storage for the rest of the year, you should clean the fog machine before you pack it up for storage. Don’t wait until you bring it out the next year because a clogged fog machine that sits unused for months on end will most likely be permanently unusable when you try to use it again.Before you store your fog machine for an extended period of time, check its output to ensure you don’t need to clean it before storing it.  

take the fog machine outside.  empty the tank.  make a mixture of water and vinegar.  pour the vinegar mixture into the fog machine.  rinse with distilled water.  scrape out the nozzle.  wipe down the exterior.  test the fogger fluid.  purchase fog machine cleaner.  follow the manufacturer’s cleaning instructions.  avoid overdoing it.  watch for decreased output.  clean before storing. 

 Technology, clothes, culture, many different kinds of things can change in an instant. Coolness is a moving target. try to stay as up-to-date as you can on the newest, the freshest, and the coolest stuff available.   Smart-cool people are always plugged in, have always seen that meme three days before it showed up on your newsfeed, and always have opinions about the newer, the more efficient, and the most innovative dispatches from the tech world. The newest Facebook privacy updates? Smart-cool people read about that three days ago, thank you very much. Always try to update your hardware as soon as possible. The newest start-up apps, devices, games, and trends are usually cooler than slightly dated varieties. The new iPhone is cooler than the old iPhone. Why are you reading a paperback? Get an e-reader, already. You want to be the guy with the newest roll-out, drawing envious stares on the train during your commute.  Shopping, eating, and traveling in the old ways? Boring. A smart-cool person doesn't waste time going to mall, instead opting to shop online at retailers like Frank & Oak or Warby Parker. A smart-cool person doesn't go to hotels, but researches cheap options on AirBnB, and gets there by hitching an Uber ride. Stay abreast of the coolest new start-ups and innovations in the consumer culture.   You don't necessarily have to be super-plugged-in to stay on top of innovative consumer trends. Even within your own neighborhood, you can seek out new restaurants, always going somewhere else, finding the next best thing. Be restless and keep moving.  Smart-cool people pride themselves on their Twitter followers and take their online presence seriously. From your social networking to your personal websites to your World of Warcraft account, your online presence should be tricked out and fully developed. Have a blank avatar on your wikiHow account? Get serious.   Online friends are real friends. Forge relationships and friendships with people online, who'll get your particular brand of humor, your interests, and your personality. If you spend a considerable amount of time in your own head, online communities can be very welcoming. It might feel like home.  Being smart-cool means you've got to be, well, smart. Get excited about how you can translate your smarts into a career by learning about innovative fields and developments in culture. See school as a means to an end, and keep moving forward into your bright future.   Develop a thirst for knowledge of all sorts, not just what you're interested in or consider your speciality. If you want to be a hacker, be the hacker who can quote Macbeth at length. If you want to be a novelist, learn how to do things with your hands, in addition to all that brain-work. You know there's nothing cool about blowing off your homework, even when the supposedly "cool" kids at your school seem to blow it off all the time. Find confidence in the knowledge that you'll be in college, surrounded by awesome, intelligent, and beautiful people, while these fake cool kids go nowhere.  In the world of smart-cool, looking as if you pay excessive attention to brands, styles, or other trends would be conspicuously uncool. A smart person wants to look as if dressing is the last possible item on a long list of items. Dress for utility and comfort, not for "coolness." Walking around with a corporate logo emblazoned on your chest, like a billboard? Please.   Novelty t-shirts are the calling card of the smart-cool. Shop online for funny shirts with inside jokes you and your friends will get, that will leave the lame jocks scratching their heads. Found a Monty Python tee you dig? Cool.  

find the cutting edge, and be on the right side of it.  find new ways of doing necessary things.  develop your online presence.  take school seriously and get a well-rounded education.  dress how you want. 

 If you plan to add some cute accessories to make your gnome resemble your betrothed, a standard "common garden variety" gnome will do the trick. Generally, most home and garden stores carry the typical garden gnome. However, hobby stores and specialty websites may also carry theme-based garden gnomes including bikers, soldiers, firemen and more. And don't forget to check online, although shipping costs may make such a purchase less desirable.   If your husband already looks like a garden gnome, complete with trimmed beard and snub nose, then look for one that seems most representative of his look already. If the gnome has a beard (many do) and your husband does not, don't worry too much. Some artist's license is permissible here; after all, you're making a gnome representation of your husband and if that happens to also include a beard, then so be it.; , To ensure you can customize this gnome to look like your hubby, you’ll need to get the gnome's height, overall width, hat size and head size. Make a note of each measurement on a piece of paper for future reference when measuring clothing, hats, etc.  Identify three or four characteristics that represent the distinctiveness of your husband. Is he a die-hard sports team fan and loves to wear his favorite jersey? Or does he wear glasses with unique frames? Perhaps he styles his hair in a certain way or has particularly prominent features worthy of a caricature. Selecting a few strong features will help you to personalize this garden gnome to best resemble your hubby.   As well as characteristics, don't forget to think about items that represent him, such as sports gear, a briefcase, a work-related symbol like scales of justice for a lawyer or a plunger for a plumber, etc. Indeed, it may be his tools of trade that help identify him most clearly of all, or at least make him look twice!  , Take the characteristics and items that you've decided upon and plan where they'll be placed on the gnome. This exercise will help you to work out what needs to be found and purchased and what things you'll need to create from scratch. Don't spend too long on this step––a simple sketch of a stick figure gnome with arrows and instructions or pointers is sufficient.   You may work out at this stage that the gnome needs a little paintwork as well as adding clothes or accessories. Factor this into the process of making over the gnome.  Look around the house for shirts, glasses, beard materials or other items that are free to be used and could be cut down to size to accommodate the gnome's size. For example, a shirt could be cut down to size and restitched into gnome size, while oversized glasses would still work as a caricature effect.   If you have children, look through their doll clothing, typically something that may fit an American Girl Doll or even a baby doll. You might need to dye the colors or change the outfit a bit to work; think laterally. If you craft things, it's likely that you'll have the items or the materials to create accessories such as a beard, hair or glasses. Anything used for making dolls, decorations or miniatures will likely be of use. Visit local retailers to purchase appropriate clothing or accessories for the garden gnome that you couldn't rummage up at home. With list of items you still need in hand, hit the local toy store first to see if they have any of the standard clothing or features. If you cannot complete your purchase at the toy store, the hobby and/or craft store should be your next stop. And even stores that stock items for cake decorating may be useful for miniatures such as bottles and sporting gear.  Items you may need include a hot glue gun, wire scissors, needle and thread, Velcro and/or double sided tape.The types of materials you’ll need to build your gnome are dependent on what you intend doing to the gnome. For example, if your gnome is a football-jersey-wearing, beer-drinking gnome, choose the materials you’ll need to create the jersey and to affix a miniature glass or bottle of beer in the gnome’s hand. In the case of this example, the items needed may include a small white t-shirt, iron-on transfer paper (for the sports logo) or a fabric pen, hot glue gun or even super glue to keep the small bottle in the gnome’s hand.   Don't forget the potential of changing the way the gnome looks through the use of paint and markers. A mustache, a swirl or hair, a ruddy complexion, etc., can all be created through the use of drawing or painting directly onto the gnome.  In some cases, you may not be able to find that University of Michigan jersey small enough for your garden gnome, for example. If that’s the case, purchase a small white t-shirt from either the toy or craft store and either freehand draw the logo using fabric pen paint or generate an iron-on transfer using graphics you can find online. Almost anything can be miniaturized with a little creative thinking.   Items such as glasses and studs can be created using strong craft wire. Use yarn or special craft string for hair. Colored cotton wool can serve as a beard. Glue on real shoelaces to give the impression of strong work boots. An old beloved shirt can be cut down to size, or even just a logo can be removed from an old piece of clothing and stitched to the gnome's clothing.  Set aside an afternoon or evening to spend creating the gnome. Naturally, either keep your husband out of the way or rely on the reality that most husbands stop looking closely at what wives are doing when it comes to "making craft" to reassure yourself that he's not going to put two and two together to note what you're really up to. You could probably even ask him to hold a piece in place while you glue and he still wouldn't notice…   Create any items that need to be created by hand. For example, if you have to make the shirt, glasses, hair etc., create that first. Keep the gnome on hand to ensure sizing and fit is accurate. If you can't sew, use glue or get a friend to do any sewing needed. Affix clothing or accessories that do not require glue first. That way you can start to get an idea of how your gnome will look without committing to the design with glue. Glue or add remaining items to the gnome. You may want to hold the items up to the gnome first to make sure the accessories go exactly where they should--for example, if you are adding an item for the gnome to hold, hold it up to his hand to make sure you like how it is placed before you add glue. Allow any glue used to dry on the gnome for two to three hours, or for the time specified by the glue instructions. To ensure everything stays in place allow the glue to dry so it doesn't fall apart when you place it in your garden.  Find a strategic place in your garden such as by a fountain or next to a favorite plant. You could place it somewhere that he is bound to come across it regularly or somewhere that he is only likely to discover on the weekend when gardening or mowing the lawn; it's up to you and when you want the impact to occur. Don’t tell your husband that you’ve created his alter-ego to protect the garden. Instead, wait to see how long it takes for him to notice. When he does, provided he finds it funny, own up and have a good laugh together about the whole husband-like gnome thing. In fact, get a photo of the two of them together and post it online. Then wait for your turn as he plots to make a garden gnome that looks just like his wife…   If your husband doesn't have a sense of humor about it, tell him any resemblance to himself is a mere coincidence and that he is just flattering himself to think you'd take the time to make the gnome look anything like him. If your husband really gets irritable about what you've done, either cause the gnome to disappear quickly or reshape its features completely. If you didn't already know your husband's level of tolerance for garden gnomes, you sure do now.  

purchase a standard garden gnome.  take the gnome’s exact measurements.  study your husband’s characteristics.  draw a basic plan on paper of how you envisage transforming the gnome into your husband.  search for mini-replicas of your husband’s distinct characteristics or items.  assemble the tools to help you create your husband-like garden gnome from the craft store.  improvise with clothing or accessories to obtain the desired result.  assemble the husband-like gnome.  place the husband-like gnome in your garden or on your lawn.

 A pulse oximetry test can give the saturation of oxygen in your blood by transmitting light through your tissues. It You may need to have your blood oxygen level tested prior to surgery or other medical procedures, or if you have certain conditions, such as:Sleep apnea A heart attack or congestive heart failure Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Anemia Lung cancer Asthma Pneumonia Cystic fibrosis A current or possible need for mechanical ventilation to support your breathing  , The pulse oximetry method of measuring blood oxygen level is non-invasive, so there is usually little you need to do to prepare for the test.However, your doctor will still discuss the test with you and answer any questions you may have.   You may be asked to remove fingernail polish, if applicable. Your doctor may give you other specific instructions for preparation, based on your medical condition and history.  There are very few risks associated with pulse oximetry.These are minimal, but include:   Skin irritation at the application site. This may occur with prolonged or repeated application of the probe sensor. Inaccurate readings in cases of smoke or carbon monoxide inhalation. Your doctor can let you know if there are any additional risks, based on your specific medical condition.  The sensor used to measure the oxygen level of blood by pulse oximetry is a clip-like device called a probe.The probe sensor contains a light source, a light detector, and a microprocessor. The light emitted from the source on one side of the clip passes through your skin and reaches the detector on the other side of the clip. The microprocessor does calculations based on the information received from the detector in order to calculate the oxygen level of your blood with a very small margin of error.  Usually, a finger, ear, or nose is chosen as the site to attach the sensor.The sensor will then use light to measure the oxygen level of your blood.   This method has the advantage of being painless and noninvasive, since no needles are involved.However, it is not as accurate as an arterial blood gas test, so in some cases, both tests may need to be performed.Your health professional cannot attach the sensor to an area with excessive movement or tremor, or with bruising.For example, if you have a dark bruise under your fingernail, your health professional may place the sensor on your ear instead.  The sensor’s microprocessor will compare the transmission of two wavelengths of light, red and infrared, as they pass through the relatively thin skin of your finger, ear or other site.Hemoglobin in your blood that has absorbed oxygen absorbs more infrared light, while hemoglobin lacking oxygen absorbs more red light. The sensor calculates the difference between these two values to provide information for deriving your blood oxygen level., If you are having your blood oxygen level measured for a one-time reading, then once the sensor has taken the necessary measurements and completed its calculations, the probe can be removed.In some cases (such as for certain congenital heart conditions), however, your doctor may require you to wear the probe for continuous monitoring.If you are asked to do this, remove the probe sensor only when your doctor tells you to.  Most of the time, there are no special restrictions following the pulse oximetry test, and you can immediately return to normal activities. Depending on your individual medical condition, however, your doctor may give you special post-procedure instructions.  Once your doctor has the results of your pulse oximetry test, he or she will review them with you.An oxygen saturation level of about 95% is described as normal.Your doctor will discuss the implications of your test results with you, including how certain factors may alter the results of the test, including:   Decreased peripheral blood flow Light shining on the oximetry probe Movement of the test site area Anemia Abnormal warmth or coolness at the test site area Sweating at the test site area Recent injection of contrast dye Smoking tobacco  

contact a health professional to receive a pulse oximetry test.  prepare for the procedure.  know the risks.  have your health professional prepare the sensor.  have your health professional attach the sensor to your body.  let the sensor perform a reading.  remove the probe.  follow post-procedure instructions.  interpret the results. 

 Most attorneys are ethical people who provide good representations to their clients. However, there will always be a few who are looking to scam you, or who will not adequately represent you. Consider the following when choosing an attorney., If a lawyer contacts you without your permission or expressed interest, do not hire him or her. It is against the Legal Rules of Professional Conduct for a lawyer to contact you if you have not expressed interest in his or her services, or given him or her permission to contact you.Attorneys are not allowed to pressure you into any fee arrangement. They should give you time to consider any arrangement you may. Do not hire a lawyer who pressures you to make any agreement., If the lawyer will not share these details with you, do not hire him or her.Verify your lawyer’s background and credentials with the local or state bar association. You can verify the information your lawyer has given you and check whether s/he has any ethics violations or disciplinary actions on his or her record. The American Bar Association has a directory of state and local bar associations. If the lawyer has been disciplined multiple times or suspended, you should generally avoid hiring him or her. If you wish, you can ask for an explanation of their conduct and make your choice then.  Don’t hire an attorney who encourages you to do anything illegal or unethical. For example, a lawyer who suggests that you lie in statements or on paperwork should be avoided.Never hire lawyers who make unethical offers themselves.   Also avoid attorneys who make specific promises about the results of your case. It is unethical for a lawyer to promise you that s/he will get a specific result for you if you hire him or her.An attorney cannot base the quality of representation on how much you pay. An attorney should never claim that the result of a case could change if you pay a different amount. For example, if a divorce attorney tells you that your case will have a greater chance of success if you pay for his/her “platinum” package vs the “basic” package, do not hire that attorney. This behavior is unethical. Attorneys are required to fully and competently represent you if they accept you as a client. 

avoid obvious scams and cheats.  do not hire a lawyer who has solicited you.  ask for the lawyer’s background and credentials.  do not hire an unethical attorney. 

 When you're ready to hail a taxi, stand at the edge of the sidewalk away from oncoming cars. Make sure you're at a spot where cabbies can see you, like at a street corner with great visibility. If you make it easy for drivers to see you, you will hail a taxi faster.  Stand on the side of traffic moving in the direction you want to go.; , Cabs usually have a light or sign on the roof to indicate whether they are occupied. Unoccupied taxi signs will light up or otherwise indicate that they're ready for service. Signs vary based on the area. If you're not sure what the cab signs mean, ask a local for help., Do not wave your hand frantically. Raise your hand firmly and confidently so cabbies know you want to be picked up. Keep your hand raised until a taxi driver spots you and pull over. Step back onto the curb once you have caught a driver's attention, and wait for them to park before approaching., Once your driver has stopped, approach the taxi and make direct eye contact as you do so. Open the backseat door and enter the taxi, where you can tell the driver your destination. Have your address ready (either memorized or on a piece of paper) so you can communicate with them clearly.  If you're traveling, you and your taxi driver might not speak the same language. Writing down your address is important so they know where to take you., Taxi stands are spots where cab drivers wait for passengers in an orderly line. Stand in line with other customers to wait for an oncoming taxi. When your turn arrives, approach the taxi and let the driver know where you want to go.Usually, taxi stands are located in places with lots of traffic, like airports, hotels, or popular tourist attractions. Cabs working with taxi stands are a safe option because they have to be authorized by the stand company.  If you cannot find any taxis in your area, search online for a local cab company. When you've found their number, call the taxi company and give them your current address. Wait outside until your cab arrives, and let the cabbie know where you want to go as you enter the backseat.  Call the taxi company 15-20 minutes before you plan to leave, especially during times of high traffic. Although most cab companies are available 24/7, some are not. Always check their company policies before you call.  Most cities have cab-hailing apps available in your area. Download one for your city and order a cab. Make sure your phone's location-sharing services are on so your cabbie knows where to pick you up. Stay where you are until your taxi driver arrives.  Most cab-hailing apps allow you to pay via the app using your credit card.  

stand to the edge of the street, and look for an unoccupied cab.  keep an eye out for the taxi's vacancy sign.  raise your hand in the air as the cab approaches.  make eye contact with the driver when your taxi pulls over.  find a taxi stand, if you cannot find an unoccupied taxi.  call for a taxi instead of hailing one.  download a cab-hailing app for quicker service. 

 There are many different reasons you may want to contact your child’s teacher. They can be as simple as an introduction to addressing more serious concerns. The following are some time you may want to write the teacher:   Introduce yourself after you’ve moved or your child is starting in a new school Discuss a problem Ask questions about assignments or your child’s performance Request a meeting Inform the teacher about special circumstances such as disabilities or family issues Excuse your child because of illness or an appointment.; , Gather any information you need to compose the a thorough and professional type to write to the teacher.Having all of the necessary information can prevent extensive correspondence and also shows that you respect the teacher and take the issue seriously.Ask your child what she calls her teacher or search the school’s website for her name.

For example, if your child has a disability, you may want to include a copy of the doctor’s diagnosis and any educational placements documents., Use the information you collected to write a draft email to your child’s teacher. This gives you time to completely state your concerns, consider what you’ve written and make changes.Avoid writing the email address in the “to” field so that you don’t accidentally send the first draft. Keep the draft as concise and brief as possible. Keep the tone of the email personal, polite, and professional.Include a brief introduction with your and your child’s names and why you’re writing.For example, write “Dear Mrs. Maier, My name is Teresa Lutz and I am Sophia Lutz’s mother. I am writing because she is having difficulty in math class.” Aim to keep the body of the email between 1-3 paragraphs. Address any issues or concerns you like. You may also want to consider asking the teacher how you can help support her and your child in a constructive manner.Close the email by thanking the teacher for her consideration and offering your contact information for further consultation.For example, “Thank you for your consideration about Sophia’s difficulties. Feel free to contact me any time by email or phone at (555) 555-5555. I look forward to working with you to find a solution to Sophia’s problem.”, When you’re composing your draft, aim to keep the language as positive as possible.

Keeping the tone of your email positive and proactive can set up an open and productive dialogue with your child’s teacher.Avoid using any accusatory language with the teacher. Use verbs such as understand, collaborate, and talk. Use adjectives such as positive and proactive. Combine words in phrases like “I understand from Sophia she’s having a difficult time with math. She and I would like to make a proactive change to this and we are wondering how we can work with you to improve her performance.”  , Kids are often brutally honest and lying in a letter may be exposed by a simple slip of your child’s tongue. Be as honest as possible in your letter while maintaining a professional tone.   Be direct. For example, “I have a work trip to a museum and would like to take him with me for an extra-curricular learning experience. Could you please let him and me know what homework he will need to complete when he returns to class on Friday?”  , After you have a preliminary draft email, give yourself some time to think over the content and tone. After this, make any necessary edits. Not only does will give you a chance to add or remove text, but also can help you catch spelling, punctuation or grammatical errors.Check that the revised email has an introduction, body, and closing that are honest and as positive and proactive as possible. Read the letter out loud to yourself, which can help you notice possible mistakes or phrases that may say accusatory or negative.Consider asking a friend, your spouse, or other educational professional to read the letter. This person can make suggestions on the letter to make it stronger or more positive., After you’ve made changes to the draft, write in a pleasant and professional greeting and closing. This can help make the teacher more receptive to the letter and set the tone for a constructive response.   Write the greeting how your child addresses her teacher. For example, “Dear Mrs. Maier” followed by a comma.If you are not sure if the teacher is married, use “Ms.” Instead of “Mrs.” Avoid using the teacher’s first name unless you’ve met her before and she’s extended the offer to call her by her first name. Close with “Sincerely” followed by a comma. Consider also writing “I look forward to hearing from you” followed by sincerely to prompt the teacher that you’d like a response. Include your name and how the teacher can contact you.  Depending on the nature of your email, include any documentation that clarifies your concerns. This can give the teacher reference to the case and understand the issue better.Make sure to the files are in an easily accessible format.  You’ll need to put in the teacher’s email address before you can send it. Check on the school’s website to make sure that you have the correct spelling and format of her email.   Copy any other necessary parties such as your spouse or another teacher involved in the matter. Consider blind copying yourself to have an extra copy of the email as well as make sure the email successfully sends.  Read over your email one final time before sending it. This can minimize the risk that you forgot to include something or made mistakes.  Teachers are busy and often may not have time to respond right away or may want to consider your note. Allow your child’s teacher some time to respond before following up.Specify a date if you need a timely response.Follow up on your email or letter if you haven’t received a response within a week.  

recognize when to write.  collect necessary information.  compose a first draft.  keep the tone positive.  be honest.  think over and edit your email.  put in a pleasant greeting and closing.  attach relevant documentation.  address the email.  proofread the final draft.  give the teacher time to respond. 

 If your child’s croup does not pass on its own or is more severe, your doctor may choose to prescribe a steroid like Dexamethasone. These steroids will reduce inflammation and make breathing easier.Dexamethasone is commonly prescribed because of its long lasting effect (usually around 72 hours) but it can take up to six hours to produce relief.  Epinephrine is used for croup when the child is having trouble breathing, or "stridor," at rest. It is given in a breathing machine and is called "vaponephrine." It helps relax the muscles in the airway, which helps the child breathe. It is only given in a doctor's office, emergency room, or hospital. It works quickly, but may not last as long as a steroid. Therefore, a steroid is given along with this., Your child may require medical attention to help them recover from croup, but other related issues could also require medical assistance. Dehydration is a serious risk with croup, as it can make swallowing uncomfortable. Severe dehydration can limit your child’s ability to recover and create other health issues. Keep a look out for signs that your child is becoming dehydrated. If your child exhibits any of the following symptoms, seek medical attention:If your child has been going to the bathroom less frequently than usual, that is often a sign of dehydration. The color of your child’s urine will grow darker the more dehydrated they are. Most babies should urinate at least 6 times a day, and older children should urinate at least 3 times a day. Dehydration can cause constipation, which can lead to abdominal cramping. If the soft spot (or fontanel) on an infant’s head appears sunken, your infant may be severely dehydrated. Rapid breathing and heartbeat are signs that your child is severely dehydrated. Other symptoms include no tears while crying and a dry mouth.  It is uncommon for a child to require hospitalization for croup, but it’s important that you are aware of the symptoms that may indicate that your child needs immediate medical care. Seek medical treatment if your child displays any of the following symptoms:Breathing becomes extremely labored or difficult The child begins to drool or has difficulty swallowing, or the child has noisy breathing (called stridor) even when resting Skin around the nose or mouth turns blueish or grey Fever reaches 104 degrees Fahrenheit The child is difficult to arouse or is very irritable.  In extreme cases, it is sometimes necessary to insert a breathing tube in your child’s windpipe to help ensure they are able to breath until they begin to recover. This will require hospitalizing your child.This is usually used as a last resort and is fairly uncommon. Breathing tubes are often used in conjunction with IV fluids to keep your child well hydrated.  

have your doctor prescribe a steroid.  ask a doctor to administer epinephrine.  look for signs of dehydration.  recognize symptoms that indicate an emergency.  have a breathing tube inserted. 

 You and your doctor can discuss how a specific supplement or supplement mix may impact your health based on your prior medical history and your current medication regimen. If your doctor approves your supplement use, be sure to find out the name, brand, and concentration of the supplement you can take.If you’re considering altering your supplement mix — for instance, by moving up from 500 mg capsules of fish oil to 700 mg capsules of fish oil — let your doctor know. Only your doctor is qualified to help you find a supplement mix that works for you.; , Lots of supplements don’t contain what they say they contain, or don’t contain it in the quantities that is supposed to be present. Other supplements contain harmful additives. Talk to your doctor for recommendations as to which supplement brands can be trusted.Always check for an expiration or “best by” date before buying. The Food and Drug Administration doesn’t review herbal supplements. Don’t believe the hype. Lots of supplements have only a minimal effect — if any — on the condition or symptom they are meant to cure. Even if your doctor approves the use of a certain supplement, don’t expect it to be a silver bullet.  The best way to avoid risky supplement mixes is to avoid taking supplements at all. Instead of popping supplements to solve your health problems, adopt a healthy lifestyle by eating right and getting regular exercise.A diet based primarily on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is the best way to eat. About 20% of all calories should come from lean proteins like soy, poultry, nuts, and seeds. Avoid eating processed foods high in sugar, salt, and fat. Limit your intake of red meat and alcohol. Stay active. Adults should get at least 2.5 hours of moderate exercise per week. You can start out by walking, biking, or jogging at least ten minutes each day to improve your health. As your endurance improves, spend more time exercising. Invite a friend to double the fun!If you’re overweight, identify the weight you should be at, and reduce your caloric intake while at the same time increasing your physical activity levels. Talk to your doctor about what your ideal weight is.  Certification ensures that the supplements you’re buying are safe and high-quality. Only trust valid certification and verification organizations when deciding what supplements to purchase.Don’t confuse vague certifications or appeals to authority with legitimate certification processes. For instance, some supplement mixes have phrases like “physician approved” or “physician tested.” Trusted supplement verification organizations include the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), U.S. Pharmacopeia, NSF International, Underwriters Laboratories (UL), and ConsumerLab.com.  Powdered drink mixes are especially risky for young people, who may experience liver damage after ingesting them. Hydroxycut, for instance, can cause your metabolism to go into overdrive and damage your body.These powdered drink mixes may be advertised as protein supplements, vitamin supplements, or energy supplements. They might also be advertised as metabolism-controlling supplements.  

talk to your doctor before taking any supplement mixes.  do your homework.  don’t take supplements.  look for usp or other certification.  keep away from powdered drink supplements. 

 Bend over at the waist, keeping your knees loose. Exhale completely. Now inhale deeply as you slowly rise to a standing position.   Once your lungs are filled with air, hold your breath for 10 seconds and exhale slowly. Do this at least 5 times. This helps lungs adapt to storing more oxygen and allows good gaseous exchange without getting breathless.; , Another exercise involves controlling your muscles. Take a deep breathe, then close your eyes and hold it. The less you move, the longer you can hold your breathe for.   Try to count to 100 in your head. This may be difficult at first, so just hold your breath for as long as you can, then gradually increase your time., Hold your breath for 5 seconds and then exhale slowly. This helps to increase your lungs' muscle strength.   This also increases your inhaling capacity by allowing the alveoli (respiratory sacs) to coil and recoil., The best way for you to breathe is in through your nose with your mouth closed. This is important, because this will warm and moisturize the air you are breathing in.   Cold, dry air can trigger a COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or asthma attack. Purse your lips as you breathe out.  

stand with your feet apart while you breathe deeply.  practice holding your breath.  inhale for five seconds.  practice controlled breathing while exercising. 

 Because you will be getting the bottles wet, paper labels will end up peeling and coming off in clumps anyway. They can also bunch up around your cutting blade and make it more difficult to cut an even line. Be sure to peel labels off completely before cutting your bottle.   Soaking the bottle in warm water can help loosen the label. Consider store bought products like Goo Gone that can dissolve the glue used to attach beer labels to the bottles.; , The best way to cut your beer bottle is with a store bought glass cutter. You can get these online or at most craft stores. There are also cutters made specifically for cutting glass bottles.These tend to have rollers and adjustable blades that make it very easy to secure the bottle and make an even cut.  You have two options here. You can cut the bottle closer to the top where the glass starts to curve into the spout. With this method, you will eventually glue the neck to the bottom of the bottle. You can also make the cut around the circumference of the bottle about an inch from the bottom. This way you can flip the bottle over and just glue the spout to the bottom piece which will act as the base. The second method will allow liquid to be poured into the neck which allows the goblet to hold more and also adds some character to it., Making a straight cut is difficult if the bottle is moving around. Most store bought cutters made specifically for cutting bottles will have rollers and guides to keep the bottle in place. Consider asking a friend to hold the bottle at both ends while you focus on cutting. Have your friend slowly spin the bottle as you cut so that you are working together to move around the entire bottle.   If you are cutting around the bottom of the bottle you can use a roll of duct tape as a holder. Insert the bottle into the center of the roll and grip it tight. With your free hand, position the glass cutter against the bottle. Keep the glass cutter still, using the roll of tape as a base, and start to turn the bottle until the line you are cutting meets itself on the other end.  Again, depending on what kind of goblets you choose to make, you will either be cutting the bottle closer to the top where the glass starts to curve into the spout or around the circumference of the bottle about an inch from the bottom. You can mark this area with a magic marker or by tying a piece of string around the bottle tightly to act as a guide. You should be using some pressure to make the cut around the glass. It’s normal to hear a scraping noise and the line on the bottle should be visible as you cut.You don’t need to cut all the way through. You are just scoring the bottle at this point. You may need to go around two or three times depending on how thick the bottle is and how deep your first cut went.  Scoring the bottle with the glass cutter will not make a deep enough cut to completely separate the bottle into two parts. It will only weaken that part of the bottle. Spin the place you made your cut under warm water from your tap for about a minute and then rub it down with an ice cube. The change in temperature will cause the glass to contract and expand, eventually splitting the bottle cleanly where you made your cut.You may need to repeat this process a few times. If the bottle still isn’t splitting, consider going back over your cut once more with the glass cutter, this time applying more pressure.  Clean the bottles with soap and water in the sink. Make sure to clear away any glass powder., Get some sandpaper and work your way around the edges to smooth them out. Start by working the sand paper flat on top of the cut. Be sure to make the edges as even as possible. Once it seems even, start working the edges at an angle to round them out. Work the outside edge first and then move on to the inside edge. This will make the rim of the glasses smooth so that you won't run the risk of cutting yourself when you are drinking.   A small rotary sander can make this part go much faster. You can find them at craft and hardware stores., Wash the bottle parts one more time, making sure to get rid of any fine dust left over that might get stuck in the glue when you attach your parts., What was once the very bottom of your bottle should be facing upward. Make sure this piece sits level and doesn’t rock back and forth. This is going to be the base of your goblet so you want to make sure that you have sanded it level.If you decide to cut your bottle at the base of the neck, you’ll set that top piece down and check if it is level.  Apply a thick layer of silicone adhesive around the lip of the bottle. Press it down onto the bottom piece, being sure there are no gaps. If you do encounter some gaps, fill them in with more of the adhesive., Hold the two parts together firmly for at least thirty seconds to give the glue time to secure the pieces together. Keep your hands as still as possible.   Some adhesives may require more time to start setting. Consult the package to be sure.  Most silicone adhesives will cure after a few hours, but you should at least let them dry over night to be sure. 

remove any paper labels from the bottle.  get a glass cutter.  determine where to make the cut.  secure the bottle.  make your cut.  alternate running the bottle under warm water and rubbing the cut with an ice cube.  clean the bottles.  sand down the edges around the cut.  rinse the pieces a second time.  set your bottom piece on the table cut side down.  glue the pieces together.  hold for thirty-seconds.  let them dry for twenty-four-hours. 

 While it's possible to access your Instagram account from any web browser, the online version of Instagram is actually surprisingly limited in its features. In fact, the only way to "find" people with the browser version of Instagram is to use workarounds that you wouldn't need to bother with on the mobile version. To get started, enter your Instagram login information at Instagram.com., One of the first things you'll notice about the browser version of Instagram is that there is no convenient search bar at the top of the page for finding new users. You have access to your personal feed, but not much else. You can, however, follow new users by finding comments or likes by them that appear in your feed, clicking on their username to view their profile, and finally clicking the "Follow" button under their profile picture.   For example, if you're scrolling through your feed and you see a post by a friend that has a comment from someone you aren't currently following, you can click this person's name to view his or her profile, then, if you'd like, you can follow them by clicking "Follow" on their profile page.  If you know another Instagram user's username, you can also visit their profile page directly by typing its address into the navigation bar at the top of your browser. The format for Instagram profiles is "instagram.com/" — simply replace with the person's actual username. Remember not to include any spaces.   For instance, to get to the profile page of the Instagram user "MikeyP98054," you'd type "instagram.com/mikeyp98054" into your address bar.  Because the browser version of Instagram is so skimpy in terms of features, a few third-party sites have sprung up to make it easier to find other Instagram users online. Usually, these sites allow you to type the user's name into a simple search bar like you would on the mobile version. The site then displays a list of relevant users — once you find the person you're looking for, you can then either follow this person using the third-party site's interface, navigate to his or her page directly with the directions in the step above, or find them on your mobile device.   One good third-party site to start with is Websta.me (formerly Webstagram.) This site allows you to easily search Instagram users with a simple, no-frills search bar. Best of all, you can follow and unfollow users in the app if you supply your Instagram login details. 

log in at instagram.com.  scroll through your feed looking for new names.  navigate directly to instagram.com/.  use a third-party site. 

 Using cold water, wet the bristles of a shoe brush (available in shoe stores or online) and add a few drops of dish washing liquid. Scrub your shoes all over, wetting the brush and reapplying soap when necessary. For hard to reach spots, use a toothbrush., Rinse the soap off your shoes in the sink under a gentle stream of cool water. Avoid using hot water, which can damage the material and glue on your shoes. Shake excess water off of the shoes, squeeze the material, and pat the shoes down with a dry paper towel to remove excess water., Place your wet Air Jordans in front of an electric fan to dry. The wind movement will help to dry the shoes and prevent water damage. Do not use a blow dryer on your shoes or place them near a heat source, as heat can damage the glue that holds the shoes together.  

scrub them with cold water and dish soap.  rinse off the soap with cold water.  dry your shoes in front of a fan. 

 But if you do wear makeup and want to do it differently for formal, try a slightly more dramatic make up look than you normally wear.   Apply a luminous foundation, and use concealer to hide any red spots or blemishes that you might have. Sweep some blush on your cheekbones, and wear clear lipgloss or a light nude lipstick.  Apply black eyeliner to your upper lash line, and use a shimmery neutral eye shadow across your eyelid. Apply several coats of mascara to lift your lashes and make your eyes look large.

keep your make up natural.if you don’t normally wear makeup, it’s perfectly fine to go without makeup to an 8th grade formal.  wear your hair down.whether you have short or long hair, wearing your hair down is a pretty style that will allow you to do your hair yourself.  wear your hair in an updo. 

 Dry brushing improves your circulation and helps your skin get rid of toxins, reducing the appearance of cellulite. Buy a body brush made with natural fibers and make dry brushing a part of your morning routine.   Make sure your skin and the brush are both dry before beginning. Starting at your feet, brush upward toward your heart. Concentrate on areas with a lot of cellulite, like your thighs and buttocks. Brush your arms from your hands to your shoulders. Brush your stomach in a clockwise circular motion and your arms in an upward motion. All brushing movements should be made towards your heart to encourage the return of blood and lymphatic flow. Take a shower after brushing to wash away the dead skin cells and toxins that have risen to the surface.  Taking measures to make your skin look tight and healthy doesn't actually get rid of cellulite, but it can go a long way toward temporarily reducing its appearance. Try the following techniques:   Bathe in lukewarm or cool water, rather than hot. Cool water tightens your skin and makes it look more toned. Moisturize your skin with a product that contains caffeine. Buy a cream or lotion that contains at least 5 percent caffeine, which is said to improve skin tone and decrease the appearance of cellulite. Use another topical product designed to reduce the appearance of cellulite. There are many creams and lotions on the market designed specifically for this purpose.  You can reduce the appearance of cellulite by making the color of your skin look more even. Choose a spray tan product just a shade or two darker than your skin. Make sure to apply it evenly over your legs, not just in the areas where you have cellulite.  

start dry brushing your skin.  improve your skin tone.  use a spray tan product. 

 It has to be unique, bold, and all your own! Think Taylor Swift's sweet, country girl style with those curly blond locks. Or Justin Bieber's famous hair flip.

When you meet someone, smile and try to act interested in what the other person has to say. Make friends with everyone, not just the popular people.  Don't post sloppy messages with tons of slang and horrible grammar. Not saying you have to be the grammar police, but make sure your posts and comments are readable, and look at least somewhat professional. Don't overload on the emoticons, and don't be one of those people who posts what their doing every five minutes. Two or three posts a week should do it, but make sure you actually have something to say, not just "I'm bored".  A celebrity is constantly in the spotlight!

 Use a pencil to mark down the edge of a piece of paper. You should have a mark every two millimeters. You will need to use a ruler to accurately measure out two millimeters.Make enough marks to be roughly the length of your index finger.; , Cut the side of the paper that you marked on into a long, thin strip. This will allow you to slide the paper into a piece of glass tubing. The tubing should be open on both ends.  Use a tube roughly the size of a drinking straw. If you are doing this at home and do not have a glass tube, you can substitute the glass tube with a clear straw. A colored straw would make it difficult to read the markings on your paper., Melt wax or glue to secure the paper on one side of the tube. Then, use the glue or wax to make an airtight seal on that side of the tube. Leave the other end open., The paper strip should be flush with the bottom of the tube. Use scissors to cut the strip. Be careful not to pull or tug on the strip or you might break it.  It does not matter how much water you add to the cylinder. Roughly 100 milliliters (3  fl oz) will do fine. Make sure the water is as pure and free of contaminants as possible.Any clear bottle, such as a pop bottle, will work as well.  Place four to five grams of metal in the tube. This will reduce the buoyancy of the tube enough for part of the tube to sink. This is necessary to use the instrument for measurements.One source of metal that is readily available is a small nail.  The sealed side should go into the water first. Avoid getting water in the tubing. This will change the buoyancy of the tube and get your paper wet.   You can change how much the tube sinks or floats by removing or adding weight (metal).  Use a permanent marker to make a line on the side of your glass tube at exactly the level of the water. This will serve as a point of reference for the instrument and be designated as 1.0. This mark shows how far the tube sinks in a liquid that has the exact density of water., Choose a liquid to test. Put roughly 100 milliliters (3  fl oz) into a beaker. Place the hydrometer into the beaker.  Just as you marked the surface of the water level, make a mark to show how high the liquid in question comes on the hydrometer. You can tell a little about the relative density just by this initial mark. For example, if this mark is above the 1.0 mark, the liquid is less dense than water and if it is below the 1.0 mark it is more dense than water.   Less dense liquids will allow the tube to sink farther and more dense liquids will allow the tube to sink less.  If you want a more specific relative density, you can derive it mathematically. Measure the distance from the bottom of the tube to the 1.0 mark and the distance to the new mark. Divide the distance of the 1.0 mark by the distance of the new mark. This will give you the relative density of the liquid to water.   For example, if your 1.0 mark is 5 millimeters from the bottom and your new mark is 4.5 millimeters from the bottom, you would divide 5 by 4.5. This gives you a relative density of roughly 1.1. Your liquid is 1.1 times as dense as water. In the other direction, if your 1.0 mark is 5 millimeters from the bottom and your new mark is 5.5 millimeters from the bottom, you would divide 5 by 5.5. This gives you a relative density of roughly 0.9. Your liquid is 0.9 times as dense as water.  

mark your intervals.  cut a strip from the paper.  insert the strip of paper into a glass tube.  seal one end of the tubing.  cut any excess paper.  add water to a graduated cylinder.  add weight.  insert the glass tube or straw into the water.  mark the water level.  submerge the hydrometer in liquid.  mark the level of the liquid.  derive the relative density. 

 Butter lettuce is a great choice for a breadless sandwich and requires little preparation. Choose a piece that doesn’t have too many holes, give it a rinse and then dry it in a salad spinner or with a clean towel. Throw your sandwich ingredients in the middle and then wrap it up., You can get green swiss chard or a rainbow swiss chard, which will add beautiful colors like yellow, orange and pink to your sandwich. Show off your healthy sandwich by choosing rainbow swiss chard. It also tastes great and, like lettuce, can be used raw. Throw your ingredients inside, wrap and enjoy., If you choose a sturdy green such as collards, kale or cabbage, it is best to blanch it first. Throw it in hot water for thirty seconds and then dunk it in cold water. You want to choose a leaf that looks fairly intact and doesn’t have too many holes., The next time you grill up a burger, try using portobello mushrooms instead of the bun. You will boost your fiber and eliminate the simple carbohydrates. Chop off the stems of the portobello mushrooms, wash and then throw them on the grill with your burgers. You will need two mushrooms per burger., If you are trying to cut carbohydrates from your sandwich, try using slices of jicama instead of bread. Jicama tastes like a potato but is slightly sweeter and has more water. Wash and then peel the jicama. Slice it into quarter inch slices and replace each piece of bread with one slice of jicama.If you are making tacos, you could use Jicama instead of the tacos. Instead of slicing the jicama, scoop out the middle and then throw the taco ingredients in the middle., Wash, peel and slice up a cucumber. You should cut the cucumber into quarter inch slices. Replace each piece of bread with one piece of cucumber. Since there is a fairly small surface area, you may need to make a couple cucumber sandwiches for each of the bread sandwiches you had planned to make., Decide which protein you want to use for your breadless sandwich and then prepare it. If you use cooked, shredded chicken breast, you can go right ahead and throw it on your breadless wrap. If you choose a can of tuna or salmon, you will need to drain it and then mix it with a teaspoon of mayonnaise, salt and pepper. Beans will need to be drained, and then can be added directly to the wrap., Remember that most substitutes for bread will absorb less moisture, so you may need to adjust your usual condiment choices. For instance, you may want to avoid condiments with a lot of water content, since they may make a bit of a mess. Choose thicker condiments like tahini, as opposed to watery condiments like greek dressing., You will want to be a bit conservative in terms of the amount of ingredients you throw inside, which should be proportional to the size of the leaf. Start by throwing in your protein. Next, choose a crunchy vegetable or seed such as shredded carrots, slivered almonds, sprouts, cucumber sticks or shredded carrots. Then, you will want something creamy such as yogurt or tahini. Finally, throw in something to boost the flavor a bit such as mustard or hot sauce. Finally, roll up the wrap like you would a burrito. Roll it horizontally, moving away from you. 

try wrapping your sandwich fillings in butter lettuce.  pick swiss chard for your breadless sandwich.  choose a leafy green for your breadless sandwich.  swap grilled portobello mushrooms for hamburger buns.  use jicama instead of bread.  slice up a cucumber.  choose your protein wisely.  pick your condiments.  assemble your breadless sandwich. 

 Before you go to get tattooed, make sure that you are well hydrated. Drink lots of water for the 24 hours before your tattoo and avoid dehydrating yourself.How much water you need to drink to be well hydrated will depend on your specific body.While some experts recommend eight glasses a day, your body may need more than that amount.Well hydrated skin will be in better condition for getting tattooed. This means that the surface of the skin will take the ink easier, making tattoo application easier than it would be on dehydrated skin.; , In order to limit your bleeding, you should avoid products that thin your blood for 24 hours before getting a tattoo. This means that you should avoid alcohol before getting a tattoo.Also, avoid taking aspirin for the 24 hours before a tattoo. Aspirin is a blood thinner, so being on aspirin will make your tattoo bleed more.  Depending on the size of the tattoo, you may be at the tattoo shop for several hours. You might as well be in a comfortable outfit while you are dealing with the discomfort of the tattoo process.In addition, comfortable, loose clothing may be required in order for your tattoo artist to access the area where you are getting tattooed. If you are getting a tattoo in an area of your body that is usually covered up by clothing, make sure that you wear something to your appointment that will give the tattoo artist easy access to the area. For example, if you are getting a tattoo on your leg, consider wearing shorts or a skirt, so that the tattooist can easily get to the area. Similarly, if you are getting a tattoo on your upper arm, wear a sleeveless shirt.  It is important that you have enough food before your appointment so that you don't get light headed while getting a tattoo. The pain of a tattoo is bad enough, you don't want to add to it with lightheadedness or passing out into the mix.Having low blood sugar can increase the physical reaction to a tattoo, making you more likely to pass out from the pain. Eating a solid meal before your appointment will give you the energy and stamina to withstand the pain of getting a tattoo. While it does not matter what you eat exactly, as long as it will give the the sustenance you need to get through the appointment, eating a meal high in protein instead of sugar will sustain you longer.If you are having an extremely long tattoo appointment, bring a quick snack, like a granola bar, with you. Your tattooist will be happy to take a quick break so that you can stay nourished.  You do not need to do a lot to your skin before a tattoo. Just moisturize with your normal moisturizer for a week beforehand if you have dry skin to make sure that it is in good shape. Also, avoid getting a sunburn on the area you are getting tattooed.This means wearing sunscreen whenever you leave the house.   While the area you are getting tattooed will need to be shaved, most tattoo artists do not want you to do it ahead of time. Instead, they will do it right before the tattoo to assure that any irritation does not interfere with the tattoo process.  

hydrate yourself.  avoid thinning your blood.  wear comfortable clothes.  eat before your appointment.  prepare your skin. 

 Choose the best time to break the news. Don’t have the talk when she has just gotten home from work or is preoccupied with something else. You want to have her whole attention, and you want her to be receptive. At the same time, find a balance between telling her promptly without springing it on her.You don’t want to go weeks or months without telling her you have your first boyfriend, but you shouldn’t just show up with him saying, “Hey mom, meet my new boyfriend!” Have a one-on-one conversation first. It’s wise to tell her when she’s not already bothered by something you did. If you’ve just done something irresponsible or immature, or just got in trouble for something, she might conclude that you’re not mature enough for a relationship.; , If you live with both of your parents, but you’ve decided you’re most comfortable talking only to mom at first, choose a time when your father is out of the house. Go with a time that he’s at work, or out for a few hours running errands. Alternatively, go out with your mom to grab a coffee or lunch outside of the house.   It’s usually a good idea to tell both your parents at once, but there are plenty of situations where telling your mom first is more comfortable.Sometimes, fathers can be more protective when it comes to first boyfriends, some can be more resistant if you’re coming out as gay, and some can be less tolerant if your boyfriend is of another race or religion.  Think about what you want to say, and how to say it in a mature way. Your goal should be to be clear, direct, and honest, and you don’t want to get flustered or whine. Consider writing down your main points, especially if you think you might lose track or get tongue-tied.While it’s great to plan and practice by writing down your thoughts, you should definitely break the news face-to-face. Try writing the main points, like: "Mom, I feel like we have a close relationship and I don't want to keep things from you. My friend Jerry asked me to be his girlfriend a couple weeks ago and I said yes. We're in the same grade and he's a really nice and smart guy." Jot down some points to bring up if her response isn't the one you want. Say, "I thought you might not think I'm ready, but I wanted to mention that I'm become a really mature person. I'm active at school, I keep my grades up, and I get all my chores done before you have to tell me. I don't think I'm going to marry him or anything, but I think I'm ready for my first boyfriend and definitely want to talk about your ground rules and ask your advice."  , When you have the conversation, don’t begin with all the negatives, especially if your family wants you to date a certain type of person or has any sort of strict expectations. Don’t start off by saying, “Well he’s really hot but he gets detention all the time and his grades are terrible!” Focus on both your positive attributes and those of your boyfriend.Do you have good grades? Are you a leader at school or in after-school activities? How else are you mature or responsible? These are traits that your parents will want to see in you before you get a boyfriend, so be sure to work hard in school, do your chores, and show your parents how responsible you are. Similarly, try to say as many positive things about him as possible. Show your mom that she can trust your judgment. Try telling her nice things he does for you, how he well he treats you, how sweet he is, what his talents are, and other good things about him. Considering his positive attributes can also help you decide if he’s worthy of your time. If you can’t honestly list lots of positive things about him to your mom, he’s probably not the best for you.  Unless she’s completely resistant to the idea of you having a boyfriend, she’ll probably want to know more about him. Be ready to share a picture of him so she knows what he looks like, or show her his social media profile so she can learn a little bit about him.   Remember, don’t just assume that she’ll freak out, especially if you’re well into your teenage years or on the verge of becoming a young adult. She might be overjoyed and want to gush about him with you!While it’s natural to be shy, and want to keep your personal life private, in most cases you do have to share information about your boyfriend with your parents., Remember that your mom was young once, and you shouldn’t just assume that she’ll react negatively. Your parents will always find out something that you’re hiding from them, so keeping it a secret is not the best idea. Be sure to answer any questions about him truthfully.If you want to show your mom that you’re mature enough for a boyfriend, you have to earn her trust. Keeping secrets will just harm the trust you have in one another.Don’t lie about when you first started dating. Try to be honest about as many details as possible. You don’t want to get caught in a lie, such as when your anniversary is, later on down the line!  

talk to your mom when she is in a good mood.  tell your mother when it's just you and her.  practice telling by writing down what you plan on saying.  stress the positives.  have a photo or social media profile handy.  avoid keeping it a secret.

 The act of breathing supplies oxygen to your entire body. Breathing deeply uses the entire capacity of your lungs to oxygenate blood. Though normal breathing levels aren’t unhealthy, deep breathing reaches the peak level of oxygen flowing through your body.Pay special attention to your diaphragm while slowly inhaling and exhaling full deep breaths. Feel your diaphragm lowering while you inhale and exhale fully until you feel your stomach muscles tighten and your diaphragm lift., Like deep breathing, laughing forces more air out of your lungs, which leads to a greater inhalation of fresh air and a higher supply of oxygenated blood.Laughing also works abdominal muscles and increases lung capacity.  Aerobic exercise doesn’t necessarily make your lungs stronger on its own. However, great cardio-respiratory fitness makes it easier for your lungs to supply your heart and muscles with oxygen.This puts less strain on your lungs, allowing them to function properly with less work.   The American Heart Association recommends at least thirty minutes of moderate-intensity cardio exercise five days a week or more in order to maintain good cardiovascular health., Studies have shown that diets rich in fresh fruit and fish are associated with benefits to lung health.This is especially the case with those who experience asthma, COPD, and other common lung diseases.A 2010 study also showed that a diet rich in cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, bok choy) can decrease the risk of lung cancer., The hairs in your nose act as a filter and only let extremely fine particles through. Your nose can filter particles as small as a single grain of pollen with 100 percent efficiency.This makes breathing through your nose a much better option than breathing through your mouth.  Sickness, allergies, and other conditions can all lead to common nasal congestion. A plugged nose means you’re pulling 100 percent of germs and pollution directly into your lungs by breathing through your mouth.This can exacerbate conditions such as asthma and other lung complications or even cause them in those who don’t already suffer from them.Treat common allergies with antihistamines or other decongestants to help keep your nose clear.Additionally, overly dry nasal passages that can accompany sickness make nose hairs less effective at filtering air. Consider using a humidifier or even an over-the-counter nasal mist to keep your nasal passage moist and properly filtering the air you breathe., In addition to its myriad other positive effects, drinking plenty of water is good for your lungs. You lungs have a mucosal lining, and staying hydrated keep the lining thin, which helps your lungs function more efficiently., If you have asthma or another respiratory condition, ensure you see your doctor for regular exams to help control the condition. Albuterol, a prescription bronchodilator, works well to help with asthma symptoms, for instance.  Yearly flu vaccines and pneumococcal vaccinations can help lower the risk of respiratory infections.This also means less risk of developing associated lung complications such as pneumonia.   Smokers between the ages of 19 and 65 should get a pneumococcus vaccination. Also, anyone with chronic heart disease, chronic lung disease, alcoholism, chronic liver disease, or who is over the age of 65 should get the pneumococcus vaccination.  

breathe deeply more often.  laugh more.  get regular cardio.  make dietary changes.  breathe through your nose.  keep your nose clear.  stay hydrated.  take medication if you have a lung condition.  stay current on your vaccinations. 

 Make sure that the salon is clean and follows all state safety regulations. Lack of hygiene or access to high-quality skin products may lead to more irritation of your skin, as well as the potential for infection.  You can conduct your own waxing at home, if you feel confident about your ability to apply and remove the product. There are a wide variety of waxes available, usually at your local pharmacy, that offer a range of methods and tools for self-waxing regimens. Be sure to read all labels before using, so that you’re aware of any potential side effects or irritating ingredients.  If you don’t have the time or the budget to visit the salon for a hair wax, then find a simple recipe using water, lemon juice, and sugar to make your own wax. A sugar wax is all-natural, containing no unnecessary chemical agents that might cause irritation.  If you’re waxing at home, first open your pores to allow for easier hair removal. Either press a warm wet cloth to the area to be waxed, or take a warm shower.  Bacteria and dirt on your skin can lead to redness if not removed before waxing, as the procedure can temporarily open pores wider and allow those irritants access.  Witch hazel has antiseptic properties, and so it will keep your skin clean after waxing. Additionally, witch hazel is an anti-inflammatory agent, and so it may sooth irritation and redness before it becomes a bigger problem.  

choose a qualified aesthetician to perform your waxing.  purchase a hair removal wax.  make your own waxing product.  use warm water to open your pores.  clean your skin with a gentle cleanser.  pat your skin with witch hazel after waxing. 

 It may not seem like fun, but exercise will make you happier after you finish, and you can treat yourself to something indulgent after you finish.Do whatever type of exercise you enjoy. Some options include: yoga, Pilates, jumping rope, push-ups, sit-ups, and lunges.Exercising will make your time go by more quickly and help to get you in shape all at the same time.  It's not the most fun task, but you’ll be able to better enjoy yourself later if you get some of your work done while you are alone and have the quiet to concentrate.Pick a designated area to do your work. Decide before you begin exactly what you hope to accomplish, or decide how long you want to work and set a timer. Turn off your phone while you are working.  This will make your time at home alone go by quickly, and you’ll end up feeling better in your space.Try moving around a few pieces of your bedroom furniture or lamps to give your room an easy makeover.  Being home alone can be a great time to work on doing a good deed for someone else. Think if you have any upcoming meet-ups with friends or parties to attend.  Make birthday cards for upcoming birthdays or for someone you know who is sick. Spend some time cooking something like cookies or a casserole to give to someone going through a difficult time. If you live with others, consider cleaning up for them while you are home alone so that they can come back to a sparkling clean house.  

take time to exercise.  do some of your homework.  clean or rearrange your room.  pay it forward. 

 A variety of different materials can be used to make art and each of these materials will create a different visual effect. For example, sculptors can use stone, marble, wire or wood to create their art. Similarly, painters can use watercolours, oil, chalk, and pencil. When you are looking at art, comment on the materials or medium used to create the image. If you can't identify them, look at the label., In order to sound knowledgeable while discussing art, learn to identify the style of art. For example, some common and recognizable styles include abstract, realist, expressionist, surrealist, or impressionist. A piece of art that uses realism can be easily identified because the artist attempts to create an image that looks real, almost like a photograph.Alternatively, an abstract piece of art does not attempt to mimic reality and instead, can include random splatters of paint or lines to create a thought provoking image. Familiarize yourself with the different styles by searching online for images of the different styles of art. For example, search for "impressionist images." Visit museums, which often group art by style. You may find yourself in a room of surrealist paintings, for instance.  The style of art can also be described by looking at the content of the image. For example, learn the differences between portraits (image of a person), landscapes (image of a place), or still life (image of an object) works of art., It is also a good idea to know some descriptive words that you can use while describing art. You can use them to describe the mood of the painting, as you perceive it:Dynamic Intimate Suggestive Challenging  , You may have heard of renaissance art, modern art, or cubism before. These are a few different time periods and movements within art history. To talk about a work of art, check its time period. Consider how the historic moment impacted the way that art was created.   Consider the movements that were happening at that time. For example, Cubism was a type of modern art that was developed in the early twentieth century. Artists, such as Picasso, departed from the romantic and realistic artwork of the late nineteenth century and began creating more abstract images.Think about any major world events, such as war, that may be reflected in the piece. Consider what was taboo at the time and place the art was made. Works that may not seem shocking now might have been, then, or vice versa.  

talk about the materials used.  identify the style of art.  consider the content.  familiarize yourself with common descriptive terms.  check the time period of the piece. 

 Research the species before you get one.   Fire-bellied toads are brightly colored, diurnal (active during the day), and quite hardy; a combination that’s hard to beat. Most are dull to bright green with a bright red, orange or yellow ventral (underbelly) side. Their entire body is covered in warty black spots and blotches, which are broader on their ventral region, and form a reticulated pattern. The dorsal side of some captive toads can be dark muddy green, dark black or brown instead of bright green. It is believed that this is caused by an improper diet, light levels, stress, improper temperature, humidity, or a combination of all the above. Just remember that just because their skin is warty it doesn't mean that give you warts. It's just how their skin has evolved. Fire-bellied toads reach 1.5 and 2.5 inches (3.8 and 6.3 cm). Males are usually smaller than females and can be distinguished by their more streamlined appearance and vocal ability. The ventral side of fire-bellied toads is bright to advertise their toxicity, and some will flip over to expose this when threatened. These amphibians are toxic, but only in the wild. In captivity, where their poison food source is not available they can cause only mild stomach irritation in say a dog who eats them or a hardy "blech" if tasted by a human.; ,, Use a secure screen cover to prevent escapes while providing proper ventilation. The standard enclosure size applies to these toads as does apply to all frogs and toads: 2.5 -10 gallons (9.46–37.85 liters) per toad. The enclosure should be all glass with the above mentioned screen top. You can use the metal screen tops that rest on the top of the aquarium or the pre-installed sliding screen tops; either one is fine.   Fire-bellied toads are semi-aquatic amphibians that should be provided with both a land and clean water area. The land area can compose roughly one half to two thirds of the floor area, and should contain hide spots such as cork bark, driftwood, rocks, coconut halves, and live or fake plants. The best substrates to use are:  Soil Java moss Sheet moss Coconut husk fiber Jungle soil (pre-packaged and shrink-wrapped) Large grain 1/2" (1.27cm) river rock/gravel   These are suitable substrates which will prevent the toads from swallowing earth, like small grade gravel, while eating. These toads rarely swim underwater, but prefer to float at the surface or near a shoreline. The water depth should gradually slope towards the gravel to allow for easy access and exit.  These can be placed on land or in deep water to allow the toads the chance to rest in water, if needed and/or hide to feel safe. Some suggestions for appropriate decorations are:   African Driftwood - which is a misnomer as this wood sinks like a stone Artificial branches and driftwood Coconut Shells (Sold as a half a shell with a little rounded outdoor/opening) Aquatic plants Large rocks  , The dish can be as simplistic as a plastic storage container, or large commercially available water dishes. These dishes can be submerged into a safe soil substrate, such as the ones listed above to provide easy access to the water. Because the volume of water is low in this type of container, it can become soiled quickly, and for this reason the water should be changed daily.   Another suitable semi-aquatic habitat is to create a small shoreline setup. 1/2” (1.27cm) river rock can be pushed to one side to form a thick layer of gravel that creates a land area, while the layer of gravel on the other side can remain thin. The aquarium can then be filled with enough water so that the water level remains just below the surface of the land area.  Fire-bellied toads are tolerant of a wide range of temperatures, which is one of the reasons they make good captives. Daytime temperatures should range from 72°F to 78°F (22°C to 26°C) and can drop at night to 65º-70º (18ºC to 21ºC). Cool temperatures are tolerated well, and occasional drops down to 60°F (16°C) don’t present a problem for short periods of time.    Avoid temperatures above 85°F (29°C). With this in mind, keep their enclosure away from windows. This is the case for all enclosed creatures. Temperature control can be easy for these little critters as if you're comfortable in your home with the temperature, so will they be.  Set this lighting on a timer to help prevent forgetfulness in turning the light on and/or off. Any standard UV bulb will do. Growth bulbs can be used if using live plants. You can purchase regular UV bulbs at any hardware supplier and the growth bulbs can be purchased at pet stores, online, and at hydroponics shops.  If tap water is used it should be treated with a tap water conditioner to remove all chlorine, chloramines and heavy metals. Bottled spring water can and should be used instead of tap water. Change this water daily. Make sure the water level is relatively low as these frogs are not adept at swimming and can drown easily. Keep in mind that the lower level of water you provide, the more often it must be cleaned.  In captivity they can be fed a diet that consists largely of crickets. Never use garden insects. They have most likely been exposed to herbicides and/or pesticides. Other invertebrates include:   Wax worms Small silkworms Soldier Fly maggots Dubia Roaches - These roaches are unable to climb glass. Moths Houseflies Red Wiggler Worms   Food can be offered in a small feeding dish to prevent them from burrowing into the substrate or wandering into and fouling the water areas. Inset the food dish within the substrate to allow for easy access. A feeding schedule of two to six food items per toad every 2 to 3 days is recommended. Juvenile animals should be fed daily in small quantities.         It’s important that any uneaten food or dead feeders are removed from the enclosure to prevent disease and/or injury to the toads. Do not provide food items larger then the frog can eat. Simple rule:  , This rule does not apply to worms. But be weary of worms that are too fat.  You should dust their food with reptile/amphibian vitamins and calcium once every other feeding. A good recommendation is to rotate between vitamin one feeding and calcium the next feeding. Juvenile’s should have their food dusted at every feeding.  

know what you're getting into.  in order to purchase these toads, you should contact your local exotic animal store and be sure to only purchase from sustainable captive bred facilities.  ,  get a standard ten+ gallon aquarium, which is usually large enough for a group of 2-4 adults.  add ornaments/decorations.  create a semi-aquatic setup in a small aquarium by using a large water dish for a water area.  control the temperature.  provide of a photoperiod of 12-14 hours with fluorescent lighting.  provide a source of clean water at all times.  fire-bellied eat soft-bodied invertebrates.  the food shouldn't be longer than the width of the toad's head.

 For best results, it's ideal to start at least two weeks before the concert you want to attend is scheduled, and the longer in advance you prepare, the better.; , Write down (or print out) where the concert is taking place, how much it costs to go, when it is happening, and who is performing.  The more they know about it, the more comfortable they will feel about you being there.  However, discuss the concert with your folks before you buy the ticket, because if they say no after you've bought one, then you might be stuck with an expensive ticket you can't even use!  , Get clear written directions if you have never been there before. The important thing is who will be driving you there and back. Your parents will feel better letting you go if the driver is a reliable, respectable person. As a rule of thumb, the older the driver is, the happier your parents will be.  (Make sure the driver knows this too!) It may seem dorky, but consider asking your parents to drive you. Riding a bus or other public transportation would work well too.  Try to make sure your friends don't look too scary when they first meet your parents, and get them to act polite.  You're safer together than you would be alone.  Your parents may want you to "earn" the trip to the concert. So if you don't get along well with your parents, make sure your behavior is very good for at least a week before you mention the concert. Be considerate. Do chores without being asked more than once, say "please" and "thank you," smile, and tell them a little about how your day at school was.  The concert is your time to have fun, but consider choosing an outfit that is reasonably modest and low-key. Your parents don't want you to attract "the wrong kind of attention." Remember, the music will be just as good no matter what you're wearing.  Mosh pits are actually somewhat dangerous, and your parents may not want you near one. Tell your parents you won't go in the mosh pit, and they will be more likely to say yes to the concert. (But don't say it unless you mean it.)  , Play one or two of their more positive songs, tell your parents about the band's great charity work in Africa, and so on. Be truthful, but show the band in the best possible light. Explain why seeing them live is so important to you.  Again, your parents like to know where you are and what you're up to, and knowing you'll be home at a certain time gives them assurance.  You won't be able to hear it ring during the show, but you will be able to keep in touch with your family if there is a problem. Call your parents after the concert, when you're leaving to come home.It would be better to text during the concert.  

plan in advance.  identify the concert and get as much information about it as you can.  if your parents are unfamiliar with the venue, try to find some pictures of the place to show them.  your chances of getting to go to the concert may be better if you buy the ticket yourself, rather than asking your parents to spend the money.  know how you're getting to the concert.  make it very, very clear to your parents that the person doing the driving will not touch alcohol or drugs on the night of the concert.  introduce your parents to the friends you'll be going with.  if you have a sibling that's older or close to your own age, offer to take them along if it wouldn't completely spoil your evening.  going to concerts is a privilege, not a right.  your parents may be concerned about the way you're dressed, especially if you're a girl.  consider avoiding the "mosh pit.",  pick out some things about the band or their music that your parents could appreciate.  consider agreeing on a curfew.  tell your parents that at the concert, you will carry a cell phone, keep it with you all the time, and check it every hour or so. 

 Write on the grey lines in the endorsement area on the back of the check. On the first line, write the name of your business.   For example, write "Jim's Hardware Store" on the first line of the check. Use this method when a check is made out to your business rather than just to you.  If you want to add any restrictions, then you can do this before signing the check. Just like personal checks, you can add a restrictive endorsement to your business check, indicating you only want it deposited at the business' bank in a specific account, or you can transfer the rights to the check from the business to another individual or business.   For example, writing "For Deposit Only" with your bank and account number ensures the check can only be deposited in one of your business' accounts. If you want to transfer the check, you can write "Pay to the Order of" and the name of another person or business. Once you have written the transfer endorsement, the transferee must endorse the check in order to cash or deposit it.  If you have not added a restriction, such as "For Deposit Only," this creates an unrestricted endorsement on your business check, meaning that anyone who has access to the check can cash or deposit the check.   For example, you can write "James Smith, Owner" beneath your business name. For your endorsement of a business check to be valid, you must be authorized by the business to do so. Your business account will include the names of the authorized agents, who can make payments and deposits on behalf of the business. Remember not to add the endorsement until you are ready to cash the check, to protect your check from theft. Once you have signed the check with your title and business name, anyone who has access to the check can cash it as the holder.  

endorse the check with your business information.  add any restrictive endorsements.  write your name and title. 

 Before the event, tell your teddy where you are going and what you are going to do.; , On the way there, remind them about table manners and being polite. Don't nag though.  When you arrive, take your teddy to meet everyone and politely introduce him. If your teddy is a boy, ask him to shake hands/paws with each guest. Don't forget to thank the host/hostess for the food, if you are not hosting the event.  Once the food has been prepared, let your teddy choose his own food. Watch him carefully and put back any food he is not allowed. Teddy bears can have allergies, have sensitivities to certain foods or just be on a diet.  Be careful not to get his fur dirty.  If your teddy burps, whisper in his ear to say 'pardon me'. Do the same if he passes wind.  If he does, tell him to put it in the bin instead of eating it.  If you let him go by himself he might get lost and have an accident.  Make sure your teddy is not hurt badly, and then return outside.  Always ask before you do so. 

tell teddy what's going on.  remind your teddy he needs to be on best behaviour.  introduce teddy.  allow teddy to choose his dinner.  pretend to feed him and give him a drink.  be polite.  make sure your teddy does not drop anything on the floor.  if your teddy needs to go to the toilet, excuse yourself and take him up.  if your teddy falls over cuddle him and ask to be excused so that you can go inside and comfort them.  if your teddy feels tired, lie him down in a bed inside.  when it's time to go home, wake up your teddy (if he's asleep) and either fasten on his seatbelt (if you're driving home) or carry him, ready for the walk home.  

   Some laptop brands make it easy for you to find out the type of RAM you have, but it can be a challenge for other brands. Check the documentation that came with your computer. Visit your laptop brand's support site and search for your model and build to determine the kind of RAM. The model, serial and build numbers are found on stickers on the bottom of your computer. If all else fails, visit www.crucial.com and download their free system scanner. Running this quick scan will produce a browser window with your computer's RAM details.; ,   Prices for the various types of RAM can vary. It's possible to find 4 GB sticks of DDR3 RAM for about $50, or a set of 2, 2 GB sticks for $64. Many computer technicians recommend that you install RAM as matched pairs, splitting the total RAM in a laptop into 2 equal sticks. Using multiple smaller sticks of RAM rather than one larger stick can increase the bandwidth of the memory and improve performance in some cases.    Power down your computer. Once it has completely shut down, unplug the power cable from the wall and then from the computer. Flip the laptop over onto a static-resistant surface. Touch a switch plate or otherwise ground any static electricity you may have built up. Remove the battery. Find the memory bay and remove the small screws holding the door. Lift the door out of place.    If you are replacing 1 or more sticks, remove them first, working from the top down for sticks that overlap. Gently pull back the clips securing the RAM stick and lift the outside edge slightly. Slide it back out of the bay when it is at a 45-degree angle. Insert the new sticks in the opposite fashion. Seat the pins into the bay while holding the stick at a 45-degree angle. Once the RAM is seated, press it down until the clips snap around it.    Replace the memory bay door and screws. Reattach the battery and plug in the power cable. Turn on your computer.    If it is not, follow the process again to make sure the RAM is seated firmly in place and installed correctly. If the RAM is still not recognized by your computer, double check the system specifications to be sure your system is capable of supporting the amount of memory you have installed.  

determine your current ram type, amount of ram installed and maximum availability.  shop for your upgrades.  access the memory compartment of your laptop.  install the new ram sticks.  return your laptop to operating condition.  check to be sure that your laptop is recognizing the total amount of ram you have installed. 

,, Leave it to cool. ,, You can adjust the amount, just keep in mind: more honey means you need more liquid and more oatmeal. It should form a paste texture but after few minutes the oatmeal will suck in all the liquid. Too much Vitamin C power can irritate your skin and is more difficult to dissolve into the water, so don't overdo it.  It's a bit messy so better do it at the sink.  It's recommended that you leave it at least an hour and up to three hours. It always take times to work. You can test by trying to soften your skin with honey; the longer you leave it on, the better it works.   Put a paper mask on top to avoid the oatmeal dripping all over when it starts to dry up. Note that this mask won't be dry even if you leave it until morning, because the water is very limited, and honey can't easily be dried up, and the oatmeal keeps the moisture in as well.  

boil the small amount of water in the microwave or on the stove.  ,  dip the green teabag into the water.  ,  squeeze out the liquid to the mask bowl.  using the same green teabag, boil enough water to steam your face.  ,  after 10 minutes steaming, scrub your face with your regular scrub.  ,  mix the vitamin c powder, honey and finely ground oatmeal.  apply the paste to your neck and face in bathroom.  leave the mask on as long as you want. 

 Buy a running belt (online or in sports stores) that is big enough to fit your phablet and strong enough to hold it securely. The belt should allow you a full range of motion, even when attached firmly. Look for a water-resistant model to ensure that your phablet will be protected from your sweat.Arm bands are available for phablets also, but may be more restricting given the size of the device.  Shoulder holsters are a hands-free option for securing your phone while running, bicycling, or engaging in other physical activity. Look online or in sports stores for these phone holders, and be sure to purchase a large model made to accommodate a phablet. Be sure to attach the holster securely when wearing it to avoid dropping or damaging your phone., If you want to carry your phablet and a few other items while you're on the move, opt for a hands-free shoulder bag that will secure them without slowing you down. Choose a slim, lightweight model that will not put too much bulk or weight on you. Look for a model with a front pocket for your phone that will make it easily accessible and secure., Unlike other bottoms, cargo pants or shorts generally have large enough pockets to accommodate your phablet. Bring your phablet with you while shopping to ensure that the cargo bottoms will hold the gadget comfortably. Be mindful when wearing them to avoid bumping into doorways or other hard surfaces that could damage your phablet., Look online or in sports stores to find a jacket with hidden pockets for large electronic devices like the phablet. Make sure that the product is designed with phablets in mind and check the dimensions of the pockets to ensure that your device will fit. Alternatively, look for a fishing jacket, which are designed to hold large items and likely to accommodate a phablet. 

put on a phablet-accommodating running belt.  buy a shoulder holster.  get a hands-free shoulder bag.  wear cargo pants or shorts.  buy a gadget-carrying jacket. 

 Coconut flour is much more absorbent than wheat flour. That means that you usually need much less of it in a baking recipe. How much less depends on the recipe, but you may be using as little as a third of what you'd normally use., Because coconut flour has less protein than wheat flour, it can sometimes come off as a bit dense. Wheat flour produces gluten, which helps provide stretch and bite to baked goods. It can help to add in a bit of whey powder to your recipe when using coconut flour to help replace the gluten., Not every coconut flour is the same. Some are denser than others, making your recipes turn out differently. Pay attention to what the dough looks like before you bake it. It should be similar in consistency to a dough made with wheat flour. If it's not, you may need to adjust the recipe., Unlike recipes calling for wheat flour, you need to add a significant amount of liquid to dough using coconut flour. Usually, you'll use one part liquid to one part coconut flour. You can use water, coconut milk, milk, or any other liquid you think would go well with the recipe.Another way to avoid dryness is to add pureed fruits to your baked goods, such as applesauce or pumpkin.  When baking with coconut flour, the texture of the finished product relies more heavily on the eggs than it does on the flour. That means you need to add extra eggs when baking with coconut flour. You may use as many as 6 eggs while only using 1/2 a cup (118 milliliters) of coconut flour., That is, you may decide you want to just substitute coconut flour in your favorite recipe. However, that's likely to end in disaster if you just substitute coconut flour for wheat flour one to one. It's better to use a recipe made for coconut flour that someone has already tested. Once you get the hang of baking with coconut flour, then you can start making changes to fit your needs. 

add less coconut flour than you would wheat flour.  consider adding extra protein.  pay attention to differences between flours.  add liquids in equal parts.  add extra eggs.  try an established recipe first. 

 The most common complication of diarrhea is dehydration, which can be dangerous. Be sure to drink water, broth, and juice consistently throughout the day. Even if you can only take small sips at a time, it’s important to replenish the fluids you lose through diarrhea. Drinking water is good, but be sure to also drink broth, juice, or some sports drink, too. Your body needs electrolytes like potassium and sodium.Some people find that apple juice makes symptoms worse.Suck on ice chips if you are too nauseated to drink anything.See a doctor right away if you can’t keep down any liquids for over 12 hours, or have diarrhea or vomiting that lasts longer than 24 hours. If you become severely dehydrated, you may need an IV at the hospital.If a child or baby has diarrhea, don’t give them fruit juice or anything carbonated. If you breastfeed, continue to breastfeed them as usual.; , Try loperamide (Imodium A-D) or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol). Use these only as directed. They should be easily available at your drug store or pharmacy.   Don’t give these to a child unless you check with your doctor first. Some diarrhea gets worse if you take these medicines, like if your stomach problems are caused by a bacterial infection.It’s okay to try an OTC anti-diarrheal, but if it worsens your diarrhea see your doctor right away for alternate treatment.  You can try taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (or NSAIDs, like ibuprofen and naproxen) to help reduce fever and ease the pain of stomach cramps. However, in large doses or with certain conditions these medications can cause irritation and damage to the stomach. Only take these medications as prescribed or indicated on the bottle, and avoid them if:Your doctor prescribed you a different medication, or you take another NSAID for a different condition. You have liver or kidney disease. You’ve ever had stomach ulcers or bleeding. You’re under 18. Consult your doctor first, or before giving aspirin to a child or teenager. Using aspirin to treat viruses (including the flu) in kids and teens has been linked to a potentially life-threatening illness called Reye's Syndrome., As with any illness or medical condition, one of the best things you can do for your body is to settle down. Get plenty of sleep, stay warm, and allow your body to rest. This will help you fight off any infection that might be causing the diarrhea, and recover from the physical stress of feeling ill.  If your have diarrhea or vomiting that lasts over 24 hours, or you can’t even drink water for more than 12 hours, see your doctor to prevent dehydration.Visit your healthcare specialist if you have severe abdominal or rectal pain, black stools or blood in your stool, fever over 102°F (39°C), a stiff neck or severe headache, or yellow tinge to your skin or the whites of your eyes.You might be dehydrated if you feel really thirsty, have dry mouth or dry skin, aren’t urinating much or have dark urine, or feel weak, dizzy, fatigued, or lightheaded., Children and infants get dehydrated more quickly than adults, and the consequences are more severe. Signs of dehydration in children include: sunken eyes, a sunken soft spot on the front of the head, fewer wet diapers than normal (or generally none in over 3 hours), tearless crying, dry mouth or tongue, a fever of 102°F (39°C) or higher, irritability, and drowsiness.Also take the child to a doctor if they have diarrhea lasting over 24 hours or have black or bloody stools. Take your child to emergency room if they’re lethargic, have severe abdominal pain, have a dry mouth, or you cannot reach your doctor.  Call emergency services immediately if you or someone else has trouble breathing, chest pain, confusion, extreme drowsiness or trouble waking up, fainting or loss of consciousness, a fast or irregular heartbeat, seizure, stiff neck or severe headache, or severe weakness, dizziness, or lightheadedness. 

avoid dehydration.  use over-the-counter antidiarrheal medicine.  use painkillers with caution.  get plenty of rest.  see your doctor when symptoms persist or worsen.  take your child to the doctor if they get dehydrated.  contact emergency services for severe changes in wellbeing. 

 Sit down and write out a timeline for your project or goal. This will help you to stay on track, and you can refer back to it when your motivation wanes. For example, if your goal is exercising, on your timeline state that you would like to be able to run a mile in one month. Then make a mini plan for how you will accomplish that goal between now and your one-month mark. Cutting up your goal into increments of time will help you stay focused and keep you from becoming overwhelmed.  Control your inner dialogue and practice positive self-talk. Replace negative self-talk such as, “I can’t do it,” “I’m not the best,” “I’m not smart enough,” with positive self-talk such as, “I can do it,” “I am the best,” and “I am smart; if they can do it, I can do it.”, Stick with your goal by realizing that every process has an ebb and flow. Motivation is not a constant thing. There will be times when you are doing a great job of sticking to your timeline and your goals. However, other times, your motivation will wane, but know that this feeling is not a permanent, lasting feeling. Stick it out and wait for that motivation to come back., When your motivation is low, read a book or a blog about your goal. For example, if your goal is to publish a book or a journal article, read a book about writing for journals and publishers. These books have great tips for staying focused.  You can also ask for support when having trouble sticking to your goal. Join an online forum, ask a friend, mentor, or a family member. Remember that talking it out will help you resolve the issue.  

make a timeline.  practice positive self-talk.  don’t give up.  read a book or a blog about your goal.  ask for support. 

 Ticks enjoy tall grass and low shrubs. Some ticks are very small— almost flea sized—while others are much larger. Ticks are generally black or brown and oval in shape. Like spiders and scorpions, they belong to the group of arthropods called arachnids, and they have eight legs.; , You will need a pair of fine-tipped tweezers and a jar filled with alcohol. You will also want to have some disinfectant around such as a chlorhexidine solution (Nolvasan) or povidine iodine solution (Betadine) to clean the wound after removing the tick from your pet.   If you live in an area where ticks are common, you may also want to get a device designed to remove ticks. These clever instruments looks like a spoon with a notch cut into the side and works great to remove ticks off people and pets. Though a common belief, you cannot actually kill ticks by flushing them down the toilet. The only way you can properly kill them is to put them in alcohol or spray them with flea and tick spray., Removing ticks isn’t fun for your dog either. Give him his favorite toy to chew on and a treat or two (along with your love and affection) before you get started.  You should check your canine friend for ticks whenever he has been somewhere that is known to have ticks (hiking trails, yards with tall grass, etc.) You should feel for small bumps with your hands and look for dark, circular bumps with your eyes. Begin your search on the top of your dog's back and move down each side towards his chest and belly. Be sure to search in and around his:Legs Between his toes and pads of his feet Under his legs (armpits), belly, chest, and tail On top of, inside, and under the ears Face and on the crown of the head Chin The front of the neck  , If you have a hard time going through your pet’s hair, you might want to enlist the help of a fine-toothed comb to search your dog for ticks. If that doesn’t seem to work, you can set a blowdryer on cool and use that to part your dog’s hair. Just be aware that some dogs are afraid of hairdryers.   You should use these instruments in addition to your hands since feeling the bumps is still the best method.  These products may not be safe for very young puppies, so read and follow the directions carefully. Again, the chemicals will kill the ticks and make them easier to remove. If your pet is too young to use a shampoo or dip safely, don’t use the product. Proceed instead with manual removal of the ticks.   Do NOT use on cats unless the product specifically states that it is safe for cats.  You want to keep the hair separated so that you don’t lose the tick. Though, if you accidentally lose the part you made, simply check the same area. Ticks don’t move while feeding since they bury their heads into your pet's skin.  Carefully follow the directions on the bottle and wait for the chemicals to kill the tick. Do not overdo it. You don’t want to poison your pet. The chemicals will cause the tick to release its bite and fall off or at least make it easier to remove manually.   As with shampoos, many sprays should be avoided on puppies. Read and follow the directions carefully.  Grab the tick by the head and mouth area, right where they have entered the skin. It is very important that you grab the tick by the head rather than the body. If you grab the tick by the body, the body will break off, leaving the head stuck in your dog’s skin. This can cause irritation and infection.Do not use your fingers to remove the tick. If you use your fingers, you could squeeze the tick’s body and facilitate disease transfer to your pet. Using the special tick removing device or carefully using tweezers is highly recommended. If the tick does break off, your veterinarian will need to check the tick body parts left in the skin. Your veterinarian will determine whether there is a need to remove the leftover parts or not.  If you’re too nervous about extracting the tick with tweezers or a tick-removing device, then you can try spreading a layer of petroleum jelly such as Vaseline over the tick, especially around the head. This prevents the tick from breathing, which will make it back its head out of the skin. You can then pick up the tick with the tweezers without risking breaking the head off the body.   This isn’t a guaranteed method, and even if it does work, you may have to wait several minutes after applying the petroleum jelly for the tick to reverse direction.  Make sure that the tick is submerged and can’t get out of the jar. The tick may take up to several hours to die.  Remember that depending on where your dog was playing, he may have quite a few ticks present, so be meticulous and detailed in your search to ensure that you remove each one.  To help prevent infection, rub a triple antibiotic ointment on the spot where you removed the tick.Vets recommend a chlorhexidine or povidine iodine solution diluted in water.Check the directions on the label for specific dilution instructions.  Once you have finished removing all the ticks, make sure that they are all thoroughly sealed in the jar of alcohol. Put the lid on the jar and leave them in there for a day or so. When you are sure they are all dead, you can throw them in an outdoor trash can., Ticks can carry many diseases, particularly Lyme Disease. After removing ticks, make an appointment with the vet to ensure that nothing has been transmitted to your pet.It can be helpful to your vet if you save a few of the dead ticks when you go to dispose of them. Place them in a plastic bag and bring them to the vet. By identifying the type of tick(s), your vet will have an easier time assessing the potential for disease transmission.  Anytime you take your dog for a hike or let him play in some tall grass where you know ticks are prevalent, you should check your pup for ticks.   Depending on the area, certain ticks are more likely during different seasons. This information can be found through your local cooperative extension office, online, or from your veterinarian.  Avoiding ticks is the most effective way to keep ticks off your dog. Apply an effective and safe tick and flea control product to your dog. There are spot-on products, oral products, and collars to help manage ticks on your dog. Consult with your vet before administering a new medication. Other ways to keep your dog and home tick free include:   Keeping your grass and weeds trimmed to below ankle height. Securing your trash cans with strong lids and take out any rock piles and brushy cover. This helps keep away rodents that may carry ticks. Staying on the trails when hiking with your pet and making sure that your pet remains with you. Avoid wooded areas and long grasses where ticks are common. If your dog runs off the trail (as they often do), make sure to check him for ticks when you get home.  

know how to identify a tick.  gather your tools before you look for ticks.  make sure your pet is in calm and happy state.  search your dog for ticks.  use a comb if your dog’s hair is very thick or curly.  bathe/dip your dog with flea and tick shampoo/dip.  keep the hair separated when you locate a tick.  spray the tick with flea and tick spray.  use your tweezers to remove the tick.  apply a thick layer of petroleum jelly over the tick.  place the tick in the jar of alcohol.  repeat the previous steps to remove every tick you find.  rub some disinfectant on the tick site.  discard the ticks.  take your pet to the vet to check for disease or infection.  check your pet regularly for more ticks.  make your pet and home unpleasant environments for ticks. 

 Some banks offer an introductory 0% overdraft. Shop around to find one and open an account.With an overdraft, you spend more money than you have in your account. The bank won’t charge you interest on the overdraft for a certain amount of time., Take out as much money as you need from the bank account. The bank will set limits, so check ahead of time to find out what you can take.This is a great option if you need cash., The bank will also limit how long your account can remain overdrawn before they charge interest. Generally, banks will give you only 12 months, so make sure you can pay back the loan before then. 

open a bank account.  withdraw money.  pay back the overdraft. 

 Whether you’re looking at a printed stereogram or one on your computer monitor, get as close to the image as you comfortably can. Don’t worry about focusing on it; in fact, try to look through the image, not at it.It's usually easier to view the stereogram in printed form rather than on a monitor, so if you're having trouble seeing it on your computer, print out a copy to work with instead. If you normally wear glasses or contact lenses to help with your vision, wear them when you look at the stereogram.; , As you move away from the stereogram, your natural instinct will be to try to focus on the image. Keep your eyes from doing so by continuing to look through the image as you step back. If your eyes start to focus on the image at any point, move closer to the stereogram again, and repeat the process.Don’t get discouraged if your eyes keep managing to focus on the image as you back up. It’s normal for it to take several tries before you get it right. It can help to pretend that the stereogram is a window and you're trying to look at something through it to avoid focusing on the image itself.  At the right distance, you’ll begin to see that the patterns overlap one another and blurry 3D images may begin to appear. Continue to look at the blurry 3D image at the same distance and in the same position. It will eventually sharpen and come into focus.Remember to have patience. It can take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes for your eyes to naturally bring the hidden stereogram image into focus. If you lose focus on the image at any point, repeat the process from the beginning to refocus your eyes.  

place your face directly in front of the stereogram.  slowly start to back up.  move your head back and forth.

 Using the middle of the free-throw stripe to position yourself can lead to an awkward 30 to 45 angle to the rim, and likely a bad free throw shot.Instead, hold the ball in your shooting hand. Then, stand in front of the basket and draw an invisible line from the ball in your hand to the rim of the basket. Your right toes will be just to the left of center and your right arm should line up with the basket. Positioning yourself this way will minimize your left-to-right or right-to-left movement and give you a more consistent free throw shot. If you are a left handed shooter, you may want to practice a two handed free throw. It’s difficult to be an accurate shooter with two hands, so you can use your left hand as your shooting hand if it feels comfortable.; , Some shooters keep their toes lined up behind the free throw line. Some shooters stagger their feet slightly. Try to find a stance where you feel balanced. You don’t want a lopsided stance as this will lead to a poor shot.If you are a right handed shooter, your left foot may be a bit further back from your right foot. If you’re a left handed shooter, your right foot may be a bit further back from your left foot., Don’t lean forward. Simply transfer your weight forward into your toes.   Keeping your back straight will keep you from stepping over the free throw line and getting a foul in a game.  Your legs are what will provide the upward power for your shot. So you want to place your weight in your toes and bend your legs to access this power, or the “up” motion.Some players find it more natural to stand with their knees straight and then initiate the shooting motion by dipping down and bending their knees. Then, they will straighten their knees as they go up for the shot, or a “down then up” motion. Do whatever technique feels comfortable and natural for you.  Do not hold the ball in the palm of your shooting hand, as you won’t generate enough power from your palm to throw the ball properly.   Hold the ball so the black lines on the basketball are going across the ball. This will help with your throw. There should be a little pocket of space between your palm and the ball. Press your thumb, pointer and middle fingers against the ball to get a sense of the right hand placement. When you release the ball, those three fingers should be the last to touch the ball. This will give you a nice backspin, giving you a better chance of a successful shot.  Hold the ball on the tops of the fingers of your shooting hand and place your other hand on the other side of the ball.   Your shooting hand should be under the ball and your free hand should be beside the ball. It will act as your guide hand and make sure the ball stays balanced as you take the free throw.  Don’t let your elbow flap out to one side. Scoop it down and up so it is close to your body and in line with the rim. It should make an “L” shape.  As you shoot, don’t take your eyes off the target! Lock your eyes on the rim, not the ball. The sudden jerk of your head from the rim to the ball will throw off your shot.  Your thumb, pointer and middle finger should be the last to touch the ball. This will give you a nice backspin or rotation on the ball.   Make sure you come up on your toes as you release the ball. Coming up on your toes will ensure you are releasing as much power as possible from your legs into the shot. Make sure your back is straight and you aren’t lunging forward with your upper body. If you miss the basket by a few feet, this means you may need more power. Adjust this by jumping a little on your release to give your shot more power. If you overshoot the basket, you may need less power in your throw. Adjust this by throwing with less force and further back from the free throw line.  Keep your shooting hand up in a “gooseneck” after you release the ball, until it goes into the net. You should be up on your toes and looking at the rim, not the ball in the air or as it lands in the rim.  A big part of a successful free throw shot in maintaining your focus and technique on every free throw. The only way to do this is to practice your free throw technique every day, at every practice until it becomes natural and almost like second nature. That way, when you are at the free throw line during a game, with one five seconds to go, surrounded by all the noise of the fans, you can simply focus on the rim and make the free throw, just like you practiced.Try to shoot 25 shots every day for 5 days of each week. Keep track of how many free throws you make and how many you miss. If you aren’t making more than you miss, there may be a flaw in your technique. So evaluate your level of success and adjust your stance or your arm placement accordingly.As you practice, think: BEEF. Balance the ball, keep your Eye on the rim, keep your Elbow straight, and Follow through., Because a free throw does not involve defense, you can create a small ritual or routine before you make your shot. For example, every time Michael Jordan took a free throw, he followed the same ritual: spin the ball, dribble three times, spin the ball again, and then shoot. Relying on a ritual that you have practiced many times will relax and focus you before you take the shot.Create your own small ritual during your free throw practice. Start every free throw with this ritual so it feels natural and comfortable.  This can help you with your distance control, which is the control you have over how far or how short the ball goes when you shoot it.Stand 9 inches in front of the free throw line. Maintaining your free throw technique, shoot the ball, aiming for the back of the rim. Do this several times, missing the shot, but aiming at the back of the rim. Move 9 inches behind the line and hit the front of rim on each shot. Do this several time, missing the shot but hitting the front of the rim. Finally, move back to the free throw line and get into your free throw position. Try to swish each shot, using the same distance control you used in the previous spots on the court.  This may sound impossible, especially when you are just starting to get comfortable with your free throw technique. But once you develop a good technique and your technique feels comfortable through practice, you should be able to close your eyes, shoot, and swish the ball. 

line up the ball, not your body, with the rim.  keep your legs hip width apart and your shoulders square to the basket.  place your weight forward into your toes, but keep your back straight.  bend your legs a little at the knees.  hold the ball on the tops of the fingers of your shooting hand, specifically your thumb, pointer, and middle fingers.  use your free hand to balance the ball.  make sure your elbow is straight and close to your body.  keep your eyes on the rim.  take a deep breath, bend your knees slightly, and shoot.  follow-through on your toes.  practice, practice, practice.  find your free throw ritual.  do a shooting drill.  work up to making a free throw with your eyes closed. 

   Remember that not every market can be bargained at.; , This is a reconnaissance tour, just to see which shop has better items.  Find how much the locals usually pay for the item.   Make sure the stuff is in a good condition and worth paying for.  This is about getting a "yes", then an even better "yes".   Begin with the price that the merchant has set for you. Then, slowly talk down to price to a point that is both acceptable for both you and the merchant. If you don't have any luck, you can ask for something else to be included in the price. For example, if the shoes are 200 Baht, then you can slowly try to convince the merchant for 190, 180, until 150 (if you can) or ask if you pay for the full price but can you also get the extra shoe laces.  This is about getting a "no", then getting a "yes".   Initially, ask for an impossible price. Then, come back with a more reasonable price. For example, say that a hat costs 100 Baht. Begin with the price that the merchant will not accept for sure such as "can it be from 100 to 20?". Then you try "can it be 60?"  , The moment you get the price you like, stop. Don't think if you can go for a little more; some profit has to be made for the business to stay viable. Go home and enjoy your bargained-for item.  

choose a place and a situation.  walk around the market.  know what is going on around the marketplace.  try the foot-in-the-door technique.  try the door-in-the-face technique.  know when to stop haggling. 

 Windows gives you a few options if you want to change your desktop image, but if you want a truly personalized wallpaper, then you’ll need to find or make one.

 Spearheads can be purchased from numerous blade-smiths online. It may also be possible to purchase a spearhead from a local knife shop if your city has one.   Purchased spearheads may not come pre-sharpened. You could sharpen the blade yourself if you like, or take it to a professional knife sharpener.  The “haft” of a spear is simply the pole to which the spearhead is attached. “Hafting,” is the act of attaching a spearhead to a handle.   If you spent money on a nice spearhead, chances are you’ll want to shell out the extra money for a decent ash pole. Depending on the thickness of the haft, you may have to taper one end in order to properly secure the spearhead. Make sure you only carve enough to fit the spearhead; carve too much and you will have a gap between the haft and the spearhead resulting in a loose fit., Put the spearhead on the haft making sure the fit is snug. Your spearhead may come with holes in the “socket,” the hollowed end that fits over the haft.Using a marker or pencil, mark on the haft where the holes fall. You will be drilling a small hole here to secure the spearhead.  You can secure the spearhead with a short nail or a pin. Alternatively, you may simply use glue or epoxy if you do not have access to a drill.   If there are multiple holes in the spearhead socket, make sure you drill straight through the haft, otherwise the pin or nail will be out of alignment with the socket holes.Drive a short nail through the holes securing the spearhead to the haft. Secure one end of the nail using either a pair of pliers or a vice. This is to stabilize the spear while you hammer the other end of the nail.Using a ball-peen hammer, tap around the head of the nail until it flattens out, causing a rivet and locking the nail in place. Repeat this process on the opposite side until both ends of the nail are securely fastened. 

purchase a spearhead.  find a suitable haft.  check the fit of the spearhead.  attach the spearhead. 

 When horses experience strain, sprain, or other traumatic injury in their legs, their legs can swell. The leg may become inflamed and warm to the touch. In these cases, vets may prescribe a “sweat” bandage to help reduce fluid build-up and inflammation in your horse’s leg.Do not apply a sweat bandage to recent or open wounds  , Your veterinarian may recommend a particular poultice. You can purchase commercial sweating preparations or make your own. Ask your vet for suggestions if you choose to make your own. Common ingredients include:Epsom salts DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide) Nitrofurazone ointment Mineral oil Petroleum jelly Glycerin or glycerol  , In addition to your sweating poultice, you will need to gather the following items:   Soap and water A towel Rubber gloves Lightweight plastic wrap (e.g., kitchen cling wrap, packing wrap) Sheet cotton, roll cotton, or leg quilts Bandages Stretch adhesive tape  , It is essential that you thoroughly clean and completely dry your horse’s leg before applying the sweating poultice.Poultices that use DMSO are particularly prone to carrying any substance on the surface of your horse’s body into the wound. Make sure all of your equipment is clean. DMSO can also irritate damp skin, so dry your horse’s leg thoroughly before you apply it., Even microscopic cuts or scratches can become irritated by sweating poultices.If your horse has very furry legs, clip the fur in the area where you plan to apply the sweating poultice. Do not shave the leg, as this could nick or scratch it.  Wearing gloves, apply the sweating poultice all over the appropriate area of the leg. Apply liberally, but keep the layer even. If you apply too much, it will seep out of the wrap.Apply the poultice from the area under your horse’s knee to its fetlock., Wrap a thin, even layer of plastic wrap around the poultice. Try to avoid too many wrinkles.The plastic will help seal in the heat, producing the “sweat.”  , Wrap layers of cotton or leg quilts around the plastic wrap. The padding should be at least an inch thick. Keep the layers smooth and even., Use a support bandage that is at least 2-3” wide.Start at the midpoint of the leg and wrap in a spiral pattern. Begin at the front and work to the back of the leg. Wrap the bandage counterclockwise for the left leg and clockwise for the right leg. Wrap the bandage so that each layer overlaps the previous layer about halfway.  Do not pull too tightly on the bandage. This could cause further swelling in the leg. Try to keep the padding smooth and even as you wrap.Do not wrap the bandage too loosely, either. The fabric of the bandage should stretch about halfway to its maximum extension as you wrap it. Check the tightness by placing your finger between the bandage and your horse’s leg. If you can’t slip your finger in between the bandage and the leg easily, you have wrapped the bandages too tightly.  A horse with a sweat poultice should be confined to its stall or a small run. This will keep your horse from overexercising its leg while it is wrapped.  It’s important to check the bandage several times a day to make sure it is still in place. Check for swelling, irritation or redness in the bandage area.If you see swelling around the bandage area, remove the bandage. If your horse becomes distressed or upset, irritable, or begins to gnaw or paw at the bandage, check the bandaged area. Consult with your vet.  Do not leave a sweat on your horse for longer than 12 hours.If you need to apply another sweat, allow the leg to “rest” for 12 hours first. Then reapply the sweat.  It’s important to wash away any remaining sweat poultice after you’ve unwrapped the sweat bandage. Usually, water will do, but you can also use a a small amount of a mild shampoo. 

consult with your veterinarian.  purchase or prepare a “sweating” poultice.  gather the other materials.  clean and dry the leg.  check your horse’s leg for injuries.  apply the sweating poultice.  wrap plastic wrap around the leg.  apply padding.  wrap the bandage around your horse’s leg.  use even, moderate tension.  confine your horse.  monitor your horse’s leg.  remove the sweat bandage after 12 hours.  wash your horse’s leg.

 It may take more than one night to determine the results of this test.The next opportunity that you have to “sleep in” for a few days is your chance to perform this test. You may need several nights in a row to get the best results. Step one of the test is to go to bed at a reasonable time. If you are looking for a time when you can sleep in, then that probably means it’s a week-end or a series of days that you have off from your work or school. For the test to work, you have to resist staying up later than normal since you can “sleep in” the next day. Get accurate results from the test by sticking with a routine bedtime each night. Next, do not set an alarm clock. Sleep until you wake up naturally. If you are like most people, you will probably sleep a long time that first night, maybe even 16 hours or more. This is because you are in a situation called sleep debt. If you have a serious sleep debt, then you may have to deal with that before you can get the best results from this test. If your sleep debt is not substantial, then proceed with the test. After the first night of longer than average sleep, continue with the same bedtime, and avoid setting an alarm. After a few days you will wake up at about the same time every day naturally. Now you know how many hours of sleep your body needs every night. If you have gotten enough sleep, you should be alert and capable of doing monotonous activities without becoming sleepy.; , Sleep debt occurs when you fail to get the amount of sleep your body needs, and it actually accumulates over time.You are borrowing minutes or hours every time you cut your night’s sleep a little short. This can occur in both the short term and over months. Staying up late for work, play, or study, then getting up with an alarm clock because you have to, is a set-up for adding to your sleep debt. Repay your short-term sleep debt by adding an hour or so to each night’s sleep, and take advantage of opportunities to sleep in or take a nap until you have paid back the amount of sleep you lost over a short-term. This means that you need to keep track of the hours of sleep you lost, therefore you need to know how much sleep you need.  Longer term sleep debt accumulations may take several weeks, or even longer to pay back and get back on track.Take a vacation with nothing on your schedule, then go to bed at the same time every night and sleep every morning until you wake up naturally. Don’t beat yourself up for sleeping a lot during this vacation. Just pay back your sleep debt and get back on a regular schedule. Once you have repaid your debt and you stick to a regular bedtime, you will reach a point where you no longer need that alarm clock in the mornings. This is provided that your bedtime is early enough to allow your body to get the exact amount of sleep it requires. If you go to bed “early” for you, but you still are tired and have trouble waking up in the mornings, then try an even earlier bedtime. Not everyone fits in the realm of the number of hours considered normal. You may need to naturally sleep a little more. If earlier bedtimes do not help, then talk to your doctor. If you have worked at paying back your sleep debt and you still feel overly fatigued and exhausted during the day, then you may have an underlying medical problem or medication that is contributing to the problem. Make an appointment with your doctor to evaluate your persistent tired and fatigued feeling.  Understanding more about the symptoms associated with sleep debt is a great way to realize what happens when you deny your body the sleep it needs.A research study done by the University of Chicago followed a group of volunteers for six days that were only allowed to sleep four hours each night. After only six days of accumulating a sleep debt, the people in the study experienced high blood pressure, increased levels of the stress hormone cortisol, made only half the normal amount of antibodies to a flu vaccine, and developed early signs of insulin resistance, which is the first step in developing type 2 diabetes. Other symptoms observed in people with short-term sleep loss include difficulty concentrating, slower decision making, worsened vision, difficult driving, irritability, fatigue, and problems with memory. Researchers have also evaluated the symptoms developed in people that go for longer periods of time without getting enough sleep. These symptoms include obesity, insulin resistance, stroke, memory loss, and heart disease.  Sometimes stress and physical changes can trigger the need for more sleep.Pregnancy is an example of a physical change that triggers an increased need for sleep, at least during the first trimester. Other situations that may cause your body to need additional sleep include illness, injury, intense physical exertion, difficult emotional situations, and intense mental tasks. Allow yourself a nap or a little extra sleep time at night to compensate for these stressors.  Many professional resources publish charts that provide guidelines for the general sleep requirements divided into age groups.As we get older, the number of hours of sleep we need each night lessen. The extreme ranges include newborns that sleep anywhere from 11 to 19 hours each 24 hours period, with 14 to 17 hours considered the average range, to adults over age 65 that sleep from five to nine hours each night, with the average being seven to eight hours. Several credible sites, including the National Sleep Foundation, provide recommended sleep guidelines divided into age groups. The charts include recommended number of hours, appropriate hours, and provide ranges outside of the number of hours indicated to fall in a category of “not recommended.” Realize that every person is unique and has additional factors that may cause him or her to fall outside the recommended ranges without labeling it as abnormal. For example, some people may be on medications or have underlying diseases that cause them to sleep more than the guidelines suggest.  Make the area where you sleep as comfortable and relaxing as possible.Start by controlling the temperature. Keep the bedroom at a comfortable and cooler temperature. Use your bed for sleep and sex only. Avoid using your bed for other activities, such as studying, reading, playing video games, using any device with a screen, and watching late-night television. Make sure your bedroom is quiet when it is time for sleeping, and as dark as possible. You may need to consider using window coverings to block out any light, and ear plugs or a fan to block out external noises. Be sure your mattress and pillows are comfortable and inviting. If you share the bed, be sure it is large enough to allow for both parties to be comfortable. Try to avoid allowing children and pets to sleep in the same bed. If you work a second or third shift, then follow the same guidelines. Try to keep as consistent a sleep and wake schedule as possible.  Eating a healthy diet helps your body to function more efficiently in all areas including a healthy sleep cycle, but there are some specific things you can do to help improve your sleep quality.Avoid heavy meals late at night and just before bedtime, and avoid going to bed hungry. Limit how much you drink in the evening to prevent frequent awakenings during the night to go to the bathroom. Limit your intake of caffeine throughout the day, and try to stop drinking caffeinated beverages by 2pm each day. Stop smoking or avoid smoking close to bedtime. Nicotine acts like a stimulant and can prevent you from falling asleep. Avoid consuming alcohol close to bedtime. The initial response to alcohol is to feel sleepy, but in a few hours it changes and acts like a stimulant which can cause you to have trouble sleeping.  This includes everything from exercise during the day to getting exposure to natural sunlight.Exercise according to the recommended guidelines, which include at least 150 minutes of aerobic activity each week. Keep your exercise routines during the daytime or early evening. Avoid exercising just prior to bedtime. The link between proper exercise and sleep is well-documented. Studies have shown that moderate aerobic exercise, such as walking, can significantly reduce the amount of time that individuals with insomnia take to fall asleep compared to no exercise at all.Take advantage of daytime natural light exposure. Sunlight provides the body with important vitamins and helps to regulate a healthy sleep-wake cycle. Limit your exposure to light closer to your bedtime. If you need a nap, do not nap too close to bedtime and try to limit the nap to 20 to 30 minutes in the mid-afternoon.  This would include activities that take your mind off the stressors of the day.Some people like to read, others do crafts like knitting or painting. Consider taking a warm bath or shower, or listening to soothing music or nature sounds. Whatever works for you is great. If possible try to lower the lights during your relaxation time. Develop healthy ways during the day to relieve stressors. Give yourself permission to take breaks throughout the day to relax, talk about something fun, and enjoy a laugh with friends. By managing your stress during the day you are helping to relieve that build-up of things to worry about just before bed.  Go to bed at the same time every night and get up at the same time every morning, including weekends and holidays.Even if you do not feel tired or sleepy, try maintaining your scheduled bedtime. If you have difficulty falling asleep quickly for several nights then you may need to adjust your bedtime. Some guidelines suggest that you not go to bed until you feel sleepy or tired, while others recommend sticking with that scheduled bedtime. By maintaining the bedtime routine and schedule, you may feel sleepy once you are in bed and you allow yourself to relax. If you do not fall asleep within 15 minutes of going to bed, then get up. By doing so, you avoid adding worry about not being able to sleep to your stressors. Get up and move around or do something relaxing for a few minutes, then go back to bed. Avoid watching the clock. Relax, think of positive things from your day or relaxing activities that you enjoy, and try not to think about going to sleep.  There may be an underlying medical reason or medication that is contributing to your difficulty sleeping.Medical conditions can sometimes contribute to difficult sleeping. Examples of problems that may need to be evaluated by a psychiatrist or psychologist include depression, insomnia, ADHD, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic sleep disorder, and problems with nightmares or other emotionally disturbing sleep problems. Examples of other medical conditions that are commonly related to sleep problems include sleep apnea, Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, chronic pain, restless leg syndrome, COPD and other breathing related disorders, allergies, epilepsy, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, GERD, and multiple sclerosis. Some sleep problems are caused by disorders directly related to sleep. Examples of these disorders include circadian rhythm sleep disorders, delayed phase sleep problems, narcolepsy, cataplexy, sleep walking, sleep talking, REM sleep disorders, and shift work sleep disorder.  Sleep disorders can occur from a wide range of both medical conditions, mental health concerns, and disorders of sleep.Symptoms of sleep disorders include excessive sleepiness during the day, lingering fatigue, irregular breathing or increased movement during sleep, difficulty sleeping when you are tired and it is time for sleep, and abnormal sleep behaviors, which can include things like sleep talking and walking in your sleep.The length of symptoms associated with every possible condition that may be contributing to your sleep difficulty exceeds the capacity of this article. Talk with your doctor sooner rather than later. It is not in the best interest of your overall health to delay addressing problems you may be having with your sleep. Your doctor will help you to get answers to all your questions as well as the proper treatment for the cause of your sleep problems.  Many medications can cause either excessive sleepiness and fatigue or problems with getting enough sleep.Do not adjust your medications on your own. If you think a medication is causing or contributing to your sleep problem, talk to your doctor. In many cases, the dose can be adjusted or another drug can be prescribed in place of the medication that is causing the problem. Hundreds of medications have excessive sleepiness as a listed side effect. That list is too lengthy to reproduce here. Everything from antihistamines, to blood pressure medication, to pain meds can cause problems with alertness and sleepiness. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you think one of your medications may be interfering with your sleep. Medications can also prevent you from sleeping well. While this list is also lengthy, it is probably shorter than the list of medications that cause drowsiness. Still, many drugs can possibly disrupt your ability to get a good night’s sleep. Talk to your doctor if you feel any medication you are taking is preventing you from sleeping.  If you continue to have difficulty establishing and/or maintaining sleep, there may be an underlying reason, such as depression, or you may just need to re-establish a healthy sleep pattern.Some agents are available over-the-counter that can help you to fall asleep easier. All sleep agents available without a prescription are intended for short-term use. If your sleeping problem persists, talk to your doctor about prescription medications that may prove helpful.  

perform a simple sleep test.  pay back your short-term sleep debt.  take a vacation for long-term debt.  prevent health problems by getting the amount of sleep you need.  recognize situations that change your sleep needs.  identify your sleep needs by age.  adjust your environment.  pay attention to your eating habits.  modify your activity throughout the day.  develop a relaxation routine before bedtime.  stick with your schedule.  talk to your doctor if you continue to have difficulty.  pay attention to changes in your sleep patterns.  review your medications.  take a sleep aid.

 If you want to stay home but avoid a trip to the doctor, you have to choose a sickness that’s not too severe. You'll have to feign an illness that can only be cured by staying at home and avoiding any hard work, (like going to school)! A stomach virus is a good choice because it leaves you unable to go to class but isn’t necessarily severe enough to call for medical attention. The most awful symptoms of a stomach virus include diarrhea, vomiting and cramps.A fever also works because it makes a good excuse to stay home but usually just requires a little rest and relaxation. Fever signs and symptoms might include sweating, shivering, headache, muscle aches, loss of appetite, dehydration and general weakness. ; , People don’t generally get sick all of a sudden, so you'll have to begin feeling bad the day before you want to stay home and let your guardians know about it.   Tell your guardians that you’re not feeling your best. You can do this by saying some key phrases like:  "My head hurts.” "I ate something funny at lunch today." "A lot of my classmates have been out sick lately, I hope I didn't catch anything!"    , If you want to stay home without going to the doctor, you have to convey that you’re sick but not sick enough to need medical care.   Avoid suddenly showing all of your symptoms at once. Pretending to vomit may make your guardians concerned enough to bring you to the doctor, so it’s best to stick to feigning the other two symptoms. Avoid showing only the symptoms that you know your guardians usually treat with medication, like a headache.  At this point in your performance, you’re just starting to feel sick and need to be subtle or else risk being figured out.   The “art” of your performance lies in subtlety revealing your ailments. To help you find the right balance, think about what happened the last time you started to get sick. Avoid using direct phrases such as:  “I don’t think I’ll be able to go to school tomorrow.” ”I’m not feeling well enough to make it to class.” ”I’m too sick for school.”    , Don’t engage in the normal activities you would do if you felt well to show that you’re not feeling your best.   Decline to participate in a favorite activity, such as watching a movie or playing a board game. Seem disinterested in engaging in the things your guardians know you usually enjoy doing. Contribute little to the conversation, so that you seem too tired to be involved. If your parents ask if you’ve been feeling sick for a while, tell them that you’ve been feeling slightly off all day.  If your stomach really hurt, eating a big meal is the last thing you want to do! If you had a fever, you could be experiencing a loss of appetite, which also would make you not want to eat much.   Excuse yourself to use the bathroom and don’t come out for ten minutes to give the impression that you are feeling bad but that you can still function enough to not raise too much concern. When you return to the table, let your guardians know that your stomach is hurting by saying things like:  ”Sorry I was gone for so long, my stomach feels really weird.” ”I’m not sure if I can finish dinner, my stomach really doesn’t feel well.” ”Can I be excused? My stomach is hurting and I think I want to lay down for a moment.”   If possible, sneak some snacks into your bedroom to eat later so that you don’t get really hungry at night!  , Generally, being sick is really taxing on your body! Your body works hard to fight off stomach viruses and other fever-causing ailments so you'll need to show your guardians that your body is hard at work because you're "really" sick.   Some well-known symptoms of a fever include body aches, fatigue and muscle weakness. You can show that your tired by moving slower than normal, laying down on the couch or resting your head on the table at dinner. When you’re tired, your body temperature may drop slightly causing you to feel colder than normal. Get a blanket that’s heavier than normal to put over yourself when you’re sitting on the couch. , If you know that your guardians will want to touch your face or use a thermometer to check for a fever, you first need to elevate your body temperature.   A fever is also known as a “high temperature.” You have a fever when your temperature rises above its normal range, which is about 98.6 F (37 C). Depending on what's causing your fever, additional fever signs and symptoms might include:  Sweating Shivering Headache Muscle aches Loss of appetite Dehydration General weakness Pretending you have an increased body temperature should be done by demonstrating that you have the symptoms of a fever and by showing that you have above-average body temperature.  You want your face looks red and to feel hot to the touch.   Put on a sweater or heavy clothing to begin making your body warm. Without anyone seeing, do jumping jacks, high-knees, or mountain-climbers for one minute. If you’re not hot after one minute, repeat your method until you start to feel hot and sweaty. Don’t overdo it! You don’t want to push yourself too hard and risk injury. Be careful and only perform until you feel hot. Take off your added layer of clothing and immediately go to your guardians and say you don’t feel well. They will see that you’re sweating and if they touch your cheek, they will feel that you’re hot.  If you show that you’re consistently warm, your guardians will be more likely to believe you’re sick.   Run a cloth under hot water and put it on your face and neck when no one is looking. Be sure that the water isn’t too hot, because you risk burning yourself. Pat off the excess water with a dry towel. You want to seem warm and have a little bit of water remaining. This will make it look like you’ve been sweating. If you don’t have access to a cloth, rub your face with your hands. This will create friction and warm your face quickly, as well as make it red. Ask your guardians to feel your head or cheek. Once you’ve warmed up, tell your guardians you don’t feel good again and let them touch your hot forehead.  If you know your guardians will want to measure your temperature, you’ll have to plan ahead to make the thermometer hot to show your temperature is elevated.   Rub the tip of the thermometer with your fingers. The faster you move your fingers, the faster the thermometer will heat up to the temperature you want. If you have a heat source nearby, like a light bulb, put the thermometer next to it for a few moments. If your thermometer is one with mercury inside, then you can also raise the temperature by soaking it in hot water. Make sure that the water isn't boiling hot, as this could cause the mercury thermometer to explode. The water temperature should only be a few degrees hotter than your body temperature, around 99.5F. , Like any actor, you'll need some props to show your guardians that your symptoms are persistent and aren’t going away.Hide a cup of water somewhere by your bed. This will be used at night to really convince your guardians that you are sweating. If you have an electric tea kettle that won’t be noticed if missing, that’s even better than a cup of water. This way, you will be able to show that you’re both hot and sweating. Get a face cloth to hide by your bed next to the water. The cloth will be used to apply the water and also to make your face red.  Wake yourself up In the middle of the night to show your guardians that you still have symptoms.   Around 2AM or 3AM is a good time to wake up. Use the cloth and water that you hid by your bed to rub your face until it looks red. Don’t dry your face completely, so that it is still slightly wet and will look like sweat. Walk into your guardian's room and ask them to feel your head because you think you might be sick.  If you complain about feeling extremely sick now your guardians might strongly consider taking you to the doctor.   If your guardians come to sit with you at night, wait a few minutes before pretending to fall asleep. Tell them you feel thirsty and ask for water. Pull the sheets tight over you to show that you’re cold. Avoid talking or complaining too much: let your performance speak for itself!  , If you stay in bed, your guardians will be more likely to think that you’re tired and simply need to sleep. If they believe you need rest, you’ll be able to avoid both school and the doctor.   If your guardians come to wake you up, try to rub your face with your hands before they come into your room to make your face red and hot. Tell your guardians that you couldn’t sleep much. Say you now you’re even more exhausted than you were yesterday.  Continue “showing” your symptoms during breakfast or else your guardians will know you don’t want to go to school.   Eat little at breakfast to show your still not feeling well. Wear a heavy sweater and ask for an extra blanket because you “feel” really cold. Lay your head on the table to show that you’re really tired and disinterested  , 

pick the right ailment.  complain about the ailment.  don’t overly stress your performance!,  plant the idea that you might need to stay home the following day without being overly dramatic.  alter your afternoon routine.  don’t eat much at the dinner table.  feign tiredness.  feign a temperature increase.  increase your body temperature.  make your face red and your neck hot whenever possible.  ”trick” the thermometer.  gather supplies.  set your alarm.  don’t perform too much!,  stay in bed late in the morning.  don’t fizzle out.  if you followed these steps closely and your parents seem to buy into your story, ask them if you can stay home for the day!  

 Strengthening of the muscles around the knee joint may help decrease the burden on the knee. Preventing atrophy of the muscles is an important part of maintaining functional use of the knee and reducing further damage to the joint., Prescription and nonprescription anti-inflammatory pain medications (such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs) are drugs that help treat the pain as well as the inflammation in the knee.Always consult your doctor before attempting to treat arthritis with over-the-counter medications, especially if you are taking other medications to treat arthritis. Never exceed the recommended dosage of any medication, including over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications. Overdose of NSAIDs can be life-threatening., Hyaluronic acid helps lubricate the joint and is naturally found in the fluid of your knee. If you suffer from arthritis, the natural hyaluronic acid in your knee becomes thinner and less effective.Your doctor may recommend a hyaluronic acid (also called artificial joint fluid or visco supplementation) injection into your knee joint. Although these injections are not helpful to everyone, they can relieve the symptoms for three to six months.  There are some prescription medications available to treat arthritis. Consult your doctor whether you are a candidate for some of these treatment options.Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (such as methotrexate or hydroxychloroquine) slow or stop your immune system from attacking your joints. Biologics (such as etanercept and infliximab) target various protein molecules involved in the immune response that leads to arthritis. Corticosteroids (such as prednisone and cortisone) reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. They can be administered orally or injected directly into the painful joint.  If conservative treatments are not limiting arthritis pain or are not enough to prevent further damage, you may need a surgery, such as joint fusion or joint replacement.During a joint fusion surgery, your doctor will remove the ends of the two bones in the joint and then locks those ends together until they heal into one rigid unit. During a joint replacement surgery, your doctor will remove the damaged joint and replaces it with an artificial one.  

go to physical therapy.  take anti-inflammatory medications.  get hyaluronic acid injections in your knee.  ask your doctor if you should take corticosteroids or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.  consult your doctor whether you need a surgery. 

 These drugs do not get rid of the physical pain in the sense Novocaine or similar drugs do. Rather they work by "getting you high" or to reduce the emotional distress of pain. It is easy for those inclined to take to this feeling of euphoria and want to continue in the state.; , After a period of regular use (varies but 30 days might be a good starting point) it becomes noticeable that more is needed to produce the same effect and eventually the effect is gone. By that time physical addiction has most likely taken hold. The human body gets used to regular usage of a drug and when the drug is withheld for a time; physical addiction symptoms start to become noticeable. This is the the "dope sick" stage.  The physical addiction of opiate drugs is very unpleasant and takes a long time (week at least) to recover from. Few willingly undergo the experience of cold-turkey detox. However, given that an addict has regular access to his drugs, he can be highly functional in the workplace or home. This is the philosophy behind maintenance or giving the drug by prescription to maintain that state of no withdrawal symptoms. Methadone and Buprenorphine in pill form are most widely used for maintenance and the Buprenorphine has been a fairly recent addition.  Recent developments in Buprenorphine make this option a far less unpleasant experience than ever before. This if used properly can produce a tolerable detox within a week. This works best in a trained detox facility where the Buprenex is given sublingually several times a day in ever decreasing doses and supplemented by some sleeping and anti-anxiety medication. Various OTC meds are given for stomach and other symptoms. The reason for making this choice can be put in light of the following situation: given you have a high tolerance to such drugs, a legitimate medical situation calling for their prescribing will likely be less than effective since you have a tolerance. When detoxified for a period of several months, this tolerance goes away and standard dental prescriptions will again have an effect on you. Doctors and Hospitals tend not to increase the dose just because one is an addict. Therefore the real choice seems to be whether you want those pain meds to work when there is real need or not.  Maintenance in the form of Methadone or Buprenorphine can be obtained at various health clinics public and private. Detox by Buprenex should only be performed in an inpatient setting as vital signs are monitored constantly.  What happens after the 5 day Buprenex detox? Well, you probably will have trouble sleeping for the next 4 weeks, and you won't have a great deal of energy. Forcing oneself to exercise along with joining a 12 step support program are very helpful in this period.  You went through all that and hopefully it was enough motive to stay clean. Furthermore A 12 step support program is the only proven method to help former addicts stay clean. This does not imply a "walk in the park" It requires a lot of hard work and self examination. Yet, the end result if done correctly could be the best life you have ever had. 

understand the real facts behind the drug, and your addiction.  understand how physical addiction and tolerance are involved.  think about your choices.  consider the option of complete detoxification from the addiction altogether.  compare the choices of maintenance or complete detox.  understand what the aftermath may hold before deciding.  consider staying clean.  reread the previous steps and think about it, gather more information, and when you are ready, contact a medical professional.  

 While your genes are responsible for 60 to 80 percent of your height, good nutrition is responsible for the other 40 to 20 percent of your height.Your diet should be comprised of protein, fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy products. Limit your intake of added sugar, saturated and trans fat. Good sources of protein include seafood, lean meat and poultry, eggs, beans, peas, legumes, nuts, seeds, and soy products. Eat fruits instead of drinking fruit juice. If you drink fruit juice, make sure that is 100% juice. If you eat canned fruit, it should say "light" or "packed in own juice." Eat a variety of vegetables with many different colors such as dark green, red, orange, and starchy vegetables. Fresh and frozen vegetables are better choices than canned vegetables. If you eat canned vegetables, look for vegetables that are low in sodium. Choose whole grains such as whole-wheat bread, brown rice, wild rice, and quinoa instead of white bread and refined grains. Dairy should be low-fat or fat-free. Good sources of dairy include milk, cheese, and yogurt.  Children need 60 minutes of exercise every single day.Exercise causes your body to produce growth hormone and increase the density of your bones.Children can get exercise in many different ways such as gym class at school, recess, playing tag, riding their bike, or at any type of sports practice.Make sure you do a variety of different activities and do activities that are fun for you. Toddlers should get at least 30 minutes of planned physical activity and 60 minutes of free play each day. Preschoolers should get at least 60 minutes of planned physical activity and 60 minutes of free play each day. School age children should get at least an hour of physical activity each day. Each bout of physical activity should last for a minimum of 15 minutes., While you are sleeping, your body releases growth hormone. While missing one night of sleep will not stunt your growth, not getting enough sleep over time can negatively impact your growth.The amount of sleep you need will depend on your age and activity level.   Newborn babies (0-3 months) need between 10.5 and 18 hours of sleep per day. Infants (4-11 months) need about 9 to 12 hours of sleep at night and a few naps throughout the day. Toddlers (1-2 years old) need about 11 to 14 hours of sleep a day.Preschoolers (3-5 years old) need 11 to 13 hours of sleep each night. School aged children (6 to 13 years old) need 9 to 11 hours of sleep each night. Teenagers usually need about 8.5 to 9 hours of sleep each night.  Smoking is a sure way to stunt your growth, especially during puberty. Smoking only 10 cigarettes a day for a few years can cause you to be one inch shorter than you would have been.Smoking marijuana can also stunt your growth by decreasing your body's ability to produce growth hormone.To reach your maximum height, it is best if you do not smoke any substance.   If you are a smoker but would like to stop, there are free apps, quit plans, and text message resources that you can use.You may also call 1-800-QUIT-NOW to get information about quitting smoking.

 Write in a journal to track patterns or changes in your daily routine. This can help your doctor determine if your pain is a result of an underlying heart problem, especially if you experience chest pain frequently. Angina can be a sign of coronary heart disease (CHD), even if initial tests don't point to the disease. However, not all chest pain or discomfort is a sign of CHD. Panic attacks and other lung or heart conditions can also cause chest pain. Your doctor may ask about your symptoms, risk factors for heart disease, and your family history regarding CHD and other heart conditions.Take note of the following things in your journal:   What the pain feels like, symptoms you experience when you have chest pain, such as high blood pressure, and any symptoms you experience afterwards, such as nausea or dizziness. How often you experience chest pain, where you feel pain or discomfort, the severity of the pain and how long the pain lasts. Dietary changes or foods you ate two to three days prior to experiencing chest pain or indigestion. Also note any beverages such as coffee, tea, and soda, and how frequently you drink them per day or per week. New exercise regimes or recreational activities that cause physical exertion. Any stressful environments, work or relationships that may be causing symptoms of chest pain. Any other conditions you may have or any illnesses you may have had, such as a fever or cold, prior to experiencing chest pain. Any drugs, medications, supplements, herbs or home remedies you are currently using or may have used in the past two weeks. If your chest pain is interfering with your daily activities.; , Any kind of chest pain should be checked by your doctor, since it may be a symptom of an underlying condition. Your doctor may suggest lifestyle changes, medicines or medical procedures depending on the type and severity of your angina pain. Different types of angina have different symptoms and require different treatments. , ,If you have angina, you may diagnosed with one of the following:   Stable angina: Stable angina is the most common type which follows a regular pattern, such as when it occurs and what factors may trigger it. It usually occurs after stress or physical activity and may last one to 15 minutes. Stable angina isn’t a heart attack, but suggests that a heart attack is more likely to occur in the future. If you have stable angina, you can learn its pattern and predict when the pain will occur. The pain usually goes away a few minutes after you rest or take your angina medicine (usually nitroglycerin, taken sublingually or under the tongue). Variant angina: Variant angina is rare. A spasm in a coronary artery causes this type of angina. Variant angina usually occurs while you're at rest, and the pain can be severe. It usually happens between midnight and early morning. Smoking is a major risk factor for this type of angina. Medicine can relieve this type of angina. Unstable angina: Unstable angina doesn’t follow a pattern and it may occur more often and be more severe than stable angina. It often occurs while the person is at rest. This type is very dangerous as it suggests that a heart attack may happen soon and requires emergency treatment. Unstable angina also can occur with or without physical exertion — it often happens without physical activity. Rest or medicine may not relieve the pain. Microvascular angina: Microvascular angina can be more severe and last longer than other types of angina. It is often noticed during routine activities and times of psychological stress. Symptoms include shortness of breath, sleep problems, fatigue and lack of energy. Medicine may not relieve this type of angina.  Your doctor may suggest getting an electrocardiogram (ECG) to determine if you may have heart disease. If you experience angina pain or palpitations, an electrocardiogram is usually the first test to determine if you have heart disease. An ECG is a test that records the electrical activity of the heart to measure any damage to the heart, heart rate, size and position of heart chambers. It also measures the effects of drugs or devices you may be using to manage chest pain. In addition, an ECG can be used to monitor stress levels. The procedure for ECG is painless, done by attaching patches called electrodes to your arms, legs or chest to monitor heart activity. , Ask your doctor about an ECG if you experience angina pain and have had heart problems in the past or have a strong history of heart disease in your family. Make sure your healthcare provider knows about all the medications you are taking, as some can interfere with test results. Exercising or drinking cold water immediately before an ECG may cause false results.  Blood tests check the levels of certain fats, cholesterol, sugar, and proteins in your blood. Abnormal levels may show that you have risk factors for coronary heart disease. Your doctor may recommend a blood test to check the level of a protein called C-reactive protein (CRP) in your blood. High levels of CRP in the blood may increase the risk for coronary heart disease and heart attack. Your doctor also may recommend a blood test to check for low levels of hemoglobin in your blood. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells. It helps the blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to all parts of your body. If your hemoglobin level is low, you may have a condition called anemia.  

keep a journal.  visit your doctor for diagnosis.  consider an electrocardiogram.  get a blood test. 

 The domain is defined as the set of input values for which the function produces an output value. In other words, the domain is the full set of x-values that can be plugged into a function to produce a y-value.; , The type of function will determine the best method for finding a domain. Here are the basics that you need to know about each type of function, which will be explained in the next section:    A polynomial function without radicals or variables in the denominator. For this type of function, the domain is all real numbers.  A function with a fraction with a variable in the denominator. To find the domain of this type of function, set the bottom equal to zero and exclude the x value you find when you solve the equation.  A function with a variable inside a radical sign. To find the domain of this type of function, just set the terms inside the radical sign to >0 and solve to find the values that would work for x.  A function using the natural log (ln). Just set the terms in the parentheses to >0 and solve.  A graph. Check out the graph to see which values work for x.  A relation. This will be a list of x and y coordinates. Your domain will simply be a list of x coordinates.  The proper notation for the domain is easy to learn, but it is important that you write it correctly to express the correct answer and get full points on assignments and tests. Here are a few things you need to know about writing the domain of a function:   The format for expressing the domain is an open bracket/parenthesis, followed by the 2 endpoints of the domain separated by a comma, followed by a closed bracket/parenthesis.  For example, [-1,5). This means that the domain goes from -1 to 5.    Use brackets such as to indicate that a number is included in the domain.  So in the example, [-1,5), the domain includes -1.    Use parentheses such as ( and ) to indicate that a number is not included in the domain.  So in the example, [-1,5), 5 is not included in the domain. The domain stops arbitrarily short of 5, i.e. 4.999…    Use “U” (meaning "union") to connect parts of the domain that are separated by a gap.'  For example, . This means that the domain goes from -1 to 10, inclusive, but that there is a gap in the domain at 5. This could be the result of, for example, a function with “x - 5” in the denominator. You can use as many "U" symbols as necessary if the domain has multiple gaps in it.    Use infinity and negative infinity signs to express that the domain goes on infinitely in either direction.  Always use ( ), not , with infinity symbols.    

learn the definition of the domain.  learn how to find the domain of a variety of functions.  correctly state the domain. 

 If you get a Ragamuffin cat from a breeder, be sure to use a reputable one who is well-known in the community or who is connected to various Ragamuffin support groups or breeding societies.Members of such societies typically have to adhere to a certain code of ethics, which means you can trust that your cat is a true Ragamuffin., Most certified breeders will be able to provide you with documentation proving that the cat is a purebred Ragamuffin. This document should be accepted by any Ragamuffin breeding society as authentic and allow you to show your cat, if you so wish.   This document should include the breeder’s information, as well as info about the ancestry of the cat – including its parents.  Take the cat to your local veterinarian’s office and ask them about whether or not they believe this to be a Ragamuffin cat. The vet can inspect the cat’s physical features and personality traits in order to help you determine the breed.A vet may even be able to do a DNA test to confirm the cat’s ancestry and breed.  

get the cat from a reputable breeder.  ask for documentation.  consult your veterinarian.

 To set, you'll need to lean forward a bit, but only a little. Bend your knees slightly. Be ready to push up, and straighten your legs and your power source.  Bend your elbows at an angle. Put your index and thumb fingers so they are almost touching their opposites. There should be a spade-type space between. Place hands so thumbs are close to the forehead's hairline.  Your knees and limbs are bent at the above angles or amounts. When the ball comes, flick it up and forwards. Be sure to push off from your legs and ankles. This move is very difficult for some to master-so don't worry if you can't do this!   If you're a/the setter, you play an important role and need to practice setting more than others.

 Websites are a perfect place to showcase your listings to all potential clients. Sometimes your identified clients are not local or easily marketed to with traditional methods. Nearly every real estate business today needs a good website to help in marketing efforts. Some clients have even come to expect all legitimate businesses to have an online presence.   Make sure to optimize your website for search engines. Improving your SEO strategy can bring a lot of attention to your business. Take time to make sure the language on your website matches what your users will search for online. Consider a pay per click campaign. If your website is your business, or at least strongly relates to building your business, consider a pay per click campaign to help attract targeted clients to your website. Develop targets for both the keywords you want to use and the types of customers who would make the best leads. You’ll use this information later, when setting up campaigns. Include social follow buttons on your website. This makes it easier for people to boost your social media presence. Make sure these buttons are in a prominent location, on every page.Provide free tools or services on your website. When you provide useful resources to the clients, you establish your credibility with them. You can add tools for searching properties according to entered criteria, calculating EMI, estimating the value of a home, and selecting an appropriate locality on your site. You can also provide free chat-based consultation to help prospects with any real estate related questions they might have.  With the prevalence of social networks and social media today, it can be crucial to Use Social Media to Market Your Business. There are many ways to use social media to market small business.Focus your social media presence and communications on benefits to the client, instead of features of property. In other words, people buy, sell, or lease property that meets their needs, not property that has certain amenities. Use the social media tools that your clients use. This may include social networking sites, blogs, or microblogging sites, such as:  Facebook Twitter Instagram Pinterest   Utilize different types of content, from text and pictures to audio and video. Clients are more likely to pay attention to your online presence if there is a variety of ways for them to engage. You can even give video tours of your properties.Be active regularly on social media. Having an account is not enough. You have to be present online for your clients to notice you. Schedule regular times, at least once a week, to post new content. Invite friends, family, colleagues, and past clients to like or follow your social media pages, so they can see and share your message. Make sure to keep in mind that people should want to share and “like” your content, as you design it.  Email blasts, where a company's message is sent to a large number of subscribers all at once, is very common. Make sure to get your clients' and potential clients' email addresses. Be careful not to email too much, lest you get marked as spam.   Though research suggests that e-marketing in this way has a small impact, it shows that it does increase real estate business performance.Encourage clients to share your content by adding share buttons to your email. Set up email sign-up forms on your website. Use a subscriber's name and other details from your interactions to give emails that personal touch. This is more difficult to pull off in large email blasts.  Web syndication apps allow you to link your online presence together, and then post your content across multiple online platforms at once or on a schedule. This can be a key way to manage an unwieldy volume of online material.   Share other people's realty-related content. This can help you build professional connections rapidly. People are more likely to give you a social media boost if you give one to them. Put your content in as many places as possible. This provides your potential clients with an array of ways to access your business. Someone visiting your blog might not go to your Facebook page, and so syndication can increase the chances clients see what you create.  

build a website.  utilize social networks/media.  start an email campaign.  syndicate. 

 You might even want to travel interstate or overseas, depending on your budget.   How much time do you have for traveling? If you don't have much, choosing a mountain range that is close by makes more sense (if there are any nearby).; , If you're after specific activities, this will narrow down the options for which mountains you choose. Some mountain areas are quite developed, offering hiking trails, chalets, interesting towns, etc., while other mountain regions are wild and have little development. What do you want from your visit? Some options include:   Simply soaking up the scenery. In which, case, look for a hotel known for its scenic mountain views. Often it will be of a resort style, offering activities on the site, such as spas, fine dining and sports such as golfing or tennis. Hiking trails, rock- or mountain-climbing, parachuting, hunting, wildlife spotting, etc. Some places will have better infrastructure for this than others but you can easily check this by looking online. Visiting a national park or heritage/conservation area in a mountain region. This can include wildlife watching, sleeping in camps or huts, stargazing, seeing natural features and landmarks, etc. A field trip. Maybe you're keen to study the wildlife, find specimens of alpine plant growth, check for signs of climate change by observing the glaciers, etc. Take along a notebook and start observing! Water sports. Many mountain regions have fantastic lakes with a lot of water sport opportunities, along with cabins or similar self-contained stay arrangements.  Early and later summer are likely to be less crowded than the mid-summer time. If you're heading somewhere that is really popular, you'll need to find out whether bookings are essential, so that you don't miss out. Even campgrounds fill fast when it's a good season and some have booking requirements.  Bear in mind that even though it is summer, mountain weather can change without warning and can become very cold, very quickly. This means being prepared at all times for cold weather, even when you're out for a "short" walk. Carry a rain jacket and windproof top in your backpack, just in case. Other things you'll probably need include:   Clothing for the place you're staying at. If it's a tent, just comfortable things are fine but if it's a resort, you'll need formal dinner clothing as well as your outdoor stuff for the daytime. Hiking boots, sandals, shoes, etc. Camping gear if camping. All of your sports equipment unless you plan to hire any. Find out before you leave home whether it's possible to hire the things you'd rather leave behind. Insurance for your car, for you and your family, and for the accommodation arrangements you've already paid for. The usual gadgets you like to have with you. Maps are also useful, both in digital and paper form; you can't be guaranteed of getting good reception in the mountains. Compass, if you're heading into the back country. GPS can also be helpful, along with emergency locators if you get lost.  Some mountain ranges will contain wildlife, depending on which country and which mountain range you're in. If you're not sure, ask the locals before venturing out. Stay alert and take what you need to protect yourself, such as bear spray in bear country and knowledge of how to respond to any threat tailored to the animals you're likely to meet.  Mountain regions are wild, rugged and hazardous. It is part of their charm and attraction. Here are some of the things it pays to be aware of:   Although it's summer, an avalanche may be possible in some mountain regions. If there is snow, there is a possibility, so always know how to take care, how to avoid avalanche areas and what to do if one does happen. Windy roads and narrow roads, rock falls over roads. Each of these presents its own set of hazards. It is important to heed road signs and road closures. Do not go through closed roads for any reason; they have been closed for your safety. If you see a rockfall, report it to the authorities. And on windy roads or narrow roads, drive slowly and carefully; give other drivers plenty of space and the benefit of the doubt. Rivers and lakes. As beautiful as these water bodies are, they can also be very dangerous. A raging, swollen river can carry you away instantly if you cross it at the wrong time or fall in, while cold and deep lakes can claim an unsuspecting swimmer or boater. Treat water with care––cross rivers responsibly, always wear a life jacket when undertaking water sports and water activities and do not camp in dry creek or river beds. Getting lost. Losing your way is possible when you go into the back country. Get sufficient information before setting out, let people know where you're headed and for how long, and when to expect you back. Take appropriate precautions to ensure your safety if you do get lost, such as having emergency beacon locators with you. Remember––your cell phone, no matter how smart, is next to useless when you're in the back country.  That way, you will grow to enjoy the majestic skyline and some of the mountains will be seared in your memory, friends for life.  Talk to people who live and work in the mountain area and learn what their lives are like. You might even make new friends out there, making it worth returning the following summer!   If you're in a national park or similar, find out what talks and gatherings the rangers have organized. You can meet a lot of wonderful people who share your passion at such events.  Mountain air is good for you and while it's great to exercise in it, it's also lovely to just chill out and kick back. Take along some good books, your art kit or some nice music and allow yourself time to commune with mother nature in the mountains.  With a digital camera, everyone can take great mountain images. If you're a really serious photographer, you can take panoramic shots and maybe even climb and get some more unique shots where most people can't be bothered going. Also check out the possibilities for taking photos of the wildlife, the plant life and sunrise and sunset over the mountains.  

consider whether you want to vacation in the mountains near you or in mountains in another place.  consider what the mountains offer.  choose your time of the summer season.  pack the gear you'll need.  be wildlife aware.  be mountain aware.  stay in one place for a few days if possible.  meet the locals.  relax a lot.  take photos. 

 Unless directed by the referee to do otherwise, simply remain silent and accompany the referee during any pre-match procedures.; , The referee team should review basic mechanics and pertinent deviations from the Laws of the Game authorized by the rules of competition that apply to the game being played (e.g. age group modifications or league-specific rules). The center referee should also advise assistant referees as to any preferences he or she has for the amount of assistance ARs should offer or for the methods of communication between the referee team.  After the coin toss, the members of the referee team should walk together to the center circle, with the assistant referees to the sides of the referee holding their flags furled in the outside hand. If there is a fourth official, he or she should be to the left of the referee. The team should do a quick handshake and wish each other luck at the center mark.  After making sure the team is on the same page, both assistant referees should sprint to the goals in their respective halves and do a quick last-minute ceremonial check of the nets. Once satisfied, they should then run to their respective touchline and position themselves facing the field, even with the second-to-last defender. After counting the players in their halves, they should make eye contact with the referee and unfurl their flags.  During active play, assistant referees should strive to maintain a position even with either the second-to-last defender or the ball—whichever is closer to the goal line.   The assistant referee should stay about one or two feet outside of the touchline in order to maintain a wide-angle view of play close to the touchline and to avoid causing the ball to remain in play if it were to strike the assistant referee.  In practice—and especially when there is the potential for an imminent offside or goal/no goal decision—assistant referees should move in a side-to-side shuffle facing the field. In the event that the second-to-last defender or the ball is moving too fast to maintain position while shuffling, assistant referees should instead turn and run normally. Being in the right position at the right time is of paramount importance.  While the ball is in play, assistant referees should always keep their flags in the hand closest to the referee. Ninety five percent of the time that will be the left hand, unless the assistant is following play upfield. When moving—and especially when running—assistant referees should keep the arm that the flag is in still and not pump it while running. This may sound trivial, but when at full sprint, pumping the flag arm can look sloppy, and the motion of the flag can distract the referee and cause him or her to stop play, thinking you signalled for something.  When a penalty kick is awarded, the assistant referee should position himself or herself at the intersection of the goal line and the penalty area line to allow him or her to more accurately watch for the ball crossing the goal line or for violations by the goalkeeper.  These are as follows:   Always make eye contact with the referee before signaling. Come to a complete stop and face the field before signaling. In all signals, the flag is an extension of your arm. You should be able to trace a line from your shoulder down your arm to the tip of the flag. Signal with your arm held completely straight. If the signal is composed of multiple parts, start the first signal in the arm that will be used to make the next signal. If you must change hands, do it below your waist. Do not signal in an overly hasty manner, but do signal crisply, quickly, and authoritatively. It is sometimes helpful to signal in a manner in which the fabric makes a loud snap as you signal. Hold your signal until the referee acknowledges it, either by stopping play or by waving it off. Then drop your flag and move to the proper position.  When the ball completely crosses the touch line for a throw in, signal by raising your flag at a 45° angle in the direction in which the team entitled to the throw-in is attacking.  When the ball completely crosses the goal line for a goal kick, signal by pointing your flag straight across the field toward the goal area. Use your right hand to avoid impeding your view of the players and the referee.  When the ball completely crosses the goal line for a corner kick, signal by pointing the flag at a 45° angle downwards toward the corner flag on your side of the field—even if the corner will be taken across the field. If you are standing directly on the goal line, take a few steps upfield so that your flag is not crossing the plane of the corner flag and pointing to a spot off the field.  When you detect an offside violation by the attacking team, raise your flag straight in the air. If the referee acknowledges the signal by stopping play, drop the flag to a position indicating where the offense occurred: 45° upward for an offense occurring on the far side of the field, straight across the field for an offense in the middle of the field, and 45° downward for an offense on the near side of the field.  If you detect a foul and are certain that the referee did not see it and would not have applied advantage had he or she seen it, raise your flag straight up in the air. Make eye contact with the referee, and give the flag a slight wave. If the referee stops play, signal with the flag 45° upwards in the direction in which the free kick should be awarded.  In the event that the foul you detect in the above scenario is committed by a player in his or her own penalty area, raise your flag and give it a slight wave, but instead of signaling a direction, hold your flag horizontally across your waist to indicate that the offense warrants a penalty kick. If the referee awards the PK, move to penalty kick positioning.  When the ball crosses the goal line between the goal posts, you will do one of three things:   If there is no occurrence that would bring the validity of the goal into question, make eye contact with the referee and sprint a short distance up the touchline towards the center line. Then record the goal. If there was an offside violation by the team that scored the goal, signal the offside violation. If there was a foul by the team that scored the goal that you believe the referee did not see or any other problem that might invalidate the goal, stand at attention and do not move until the referee consults you about the situation.  If, during a valid substitution opportunity, one of the teams wishes to make a substitution and the substitute(s) is/are ready and standing at the center line, raise your flag horizontally over your head (your hands should resemble the American football "touchdown" signal with the flag held between them). Then conduct the substitution as directed by the rules of competition.  (This is another USA-specific procedure.) In the event that, based on your view of a situation, you believe a caution or send-off is warranted by the laws of the game, you may discreetly advise the referee by placing your hand over your badge to suggest a caution and yellow card, or patting your back pocket to suggest a send-off and red card. (Note: your referee may ask you to follow an alternate procedure in his or her pre-game conference; since the "back pocket" is nowadays quite synonymous with a send-off and somewhat well known by players and coaches, such an overt gesture may tie the referee's hands, so to speak, and fuel any disagreement in the event that he or she does not issue the send-off.)  , After the final whistle for the half or for the match has been blown, assistant referees should furl their flags and rush to meet the referee at the center circle. The referee team should then leave the field together.

 The first thing that will be done when you get CIT is to have your face cleansed and sterilized. After your face is cleaned, the practitioner will apply a topical numbing cream onto the affected area. This will be left on for 20 to 30 minutes.Since the procedure requires the use of needles, a numbing agent is used to ease pain or discomfort. However, you still may feel some discomfort or minimal pain.  Your treatment will either be done via a needle roller or a needle pen. The practitioner will move the roller or pen over your skin, puncturing the skin in evenly space wounds.This procedure takes anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour and a half, depending on the extent of the area being treated. Most people find the treatment uncomfortable, but not extremely painful.  After the treatment, your skin will be red or pink for 12 to 24 hours.Most people can return to work the day afterwards.If you have sensitive skin, your skin may be redder longer. If extremely long needles were used, it might take longer for the redness to subside, too.Some people might experience slight swelling or bruising. Your skin might be warm, itchy, or tight after the procedure. Others might peel. This is normal.  You should follow all post-treatment care your practitioner provides. This helps keep your skin from scarring or becoming damaged.Stay out of the sun for two days after the treatment. Wear hats, scarves, or other garments to cover your skin if you have to go outside for 24 hours after the procedure. Stay out of tanning beds after the procedure. Only use lukewarm water to clean your face for two days after the treatment. Gently pat the area dry. Don’t rub the area. Don’t touch the area with dirty hands. This helps reduce risk of infection. Refrain from putting on most makeup for 12 hours after the treatment. Your practitioner can give you mineral makeup that can be applied a few hours after treatment. Follow any skincare regimes and use any skincare products given to you by your practitioner. Avoid cosmetic products with alpha or beta hydroxy acids, vitamin A, benzoyl peroxide, or alcohol for two days after the procedure., CIT requires multiple treatments to be effective. In most cases, two to three treatments will be needed. These treatments are generally four to six weeks apart.In cases of bad scars or stretch marks, you made need five or more treatments. You should start seeing results in two to eight weeks. Some people don’t see results for up to three months.For maximum results, complete all follow-up visits suggested by your practitioner.  Though CIT is best done by a medical professional, there are at-home products you can use for minor cosmetic purposes. Home rollers or pens have shorter needles that can be used a few times a week. At-home needling devices are used to reduce the size of large pores, help with oil production, help with fine lines, and help the effectiveness of topical agents.You can use at-home CIT with vitamin C serums. It generally takes one to two hours for the wounds to heal after an at-home needling. If you use an at-home roller, make sure to buy a quality one, such as the Derma Roller home roller. It’s pivotal to get quality needles. Products sold on the internet may not be top quality and can cause damage to your skin.  

cleanse and numb the face.  undergo the treatment.  expect redness for about a day.  follow post-treatment care.  return for follow-up treatments.  consider at-home cit for minor cosmetic use. 

 It may also be accompanied by dryness or a scratchy feeling, and a hoarse or muffled voice. Some people experience sore, swollen glands in the neck or jaw. If you still have your tonsils, they may appear swollen or red, or have white patches or pus on them.; , You should also look for the symptoms of infection that may accompany your sore throat. These can include:   Fever Chills Coughing Runny nose Sneezing Body aches Headache Nausea or vomiting  , If the pain is excessive or lingers, though, you should consider seeing a physician for a physical exam. The doctor will look at your throat, listen to your breathing, and take a throat swab. While the swab is painless, it can be slightly uncomfortable if it causes a gag reflex.The sample taken from your throat swab will be sent to a lab to figure out the cause of the infection. Once the virus or bacteria causing your throat pain is determined, the doctor can advise you on treatment.   The doctor may also order a CBC (complete blood count) or test you for allergies.  Drinking water prevents dehydration and keeps your throat moist to reduce discomfort.Most people prefer room-temperature water when they have a sore throat. If cold or hot water makes you feel better, though, drink that instead.   Drink at least eight to ten 8 oz. glasses of water each day — more if you have a fever. Try adding a teaspoon of honey to the water. Honey has antibacterial properties and can help soothe and coat the throat., To help keep your throat moisturized and soothed, try to raise the moisture levels in the air. This is especially important if you live in a dry environment.   Consider buying a humidifier for your home or office. If a humidifier's not an option, leave out bowls of water in rooms where you spend a lot of time. If your throat feels particularly scratchy, try taking a hot shower and spending time in the steamy bathroom.  Studies show that chicken soup can slow the movement of specific types of immune cells. The slower movement of these cells make them more effective. Chicken soup also increases the movement of tiny hairs in the nose that can help reduce infections. You should also stick to soft, mild, non-sticky foods for a while.   Examples of soft foods include applesauce, rice, scrambled eggs, well-cooked pasta, oatmeal, smoothies, and well-cooked beans and legumes. Avoid spicy foods like chicken wings, pepperoni pizza, or anything with hot peppery, curry, or garlic. Avoid hard or sticky foods that might be hard to swallow. Examples include peanut butter, dry bread, toast or crackers, raw vegetables or fruits, and dry cereals.  Make sure to chew it enough to break it down before swallowing. Chewing and letting saliva moisten the food will make it easier for you to swallow.   You might also use a food processor to puree foods for easier swallowing., You can carry a small bottle of this throughout the day and use it to relieve pain as needed. Begin by measuring ¼ cup of filtered water for every 2 oz. of spray you want to make. To this, add two drops each of menthol essential oil (pain reliever), eucalyptus essential oil, and sage essential oil (antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory).Mix it all together well and pour it into a one or two oz. glass spray bottle. Refrigerate any unused portion to use later.  Add about 1 teaspoon of either table salt or sea salt to 8 oz. of warm water and stir to dissolve the salt. Gargle with the solution for about 30 seconds and spit it out. Repeat once every hour.The salt reduces the swelling by drawing out the water in the swollen tissues.  Unfortunately, the taste can be too much for some people to deal with, so be prepared to wash out your mouth afterward!   Add one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to one cup of warm water. If you want, you can also mix in one tablespoon of honey to help with the taste. Gargle with this solution 2-3 times a day. Don’t give honey to any child under the age of two. Young children may be susceptible to infant botulism which can contaminate honey., It also changes the pH of the throat, which helps fight bacteria. Baking soda can be a good alternative for those who can't handle the taste of gargling with apple cider vinegar.   Add ½ teaspoon of baking soda to one cup of very warm water. Add ½ teaspoon of table or sea salt. Gargle with this mixture every 2 hours.  Although you should be avoiding spicy food, cayenne pepper tea can actually soothe a sore throat. Cayenne acts as a counter-irritant: it's a second irritant that counteract the original one.It also depletes "Substance P" in the body. Substance P is a neurotransmitter associated with inflammation and pain.Stir ⅛- ¼ teaspoon of ground cayenne pepper into one cup of steaming water. Mix in about 1-2 teaspoons of honey (to taste) and sip continuously. Stir the drink occasionally to redistribute the pepper.  Licorice root tea is made from the licorice plant, Glycyrrhiza glabra. Licorice root has anti-viral, anti-bacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties.It’s good for treating any type of sore throat, whether caused by viral or bacterial infection. Most stores now carry herbal teas, and licorice root is pretty common. Use one teabag per cup of boiled water and add honey to taste.    For clove tea, add a teaspoon of whole cloves or ½ teaspoon of ground cloves to one cup of boiled water. For ginger tea, you can add ½ teaspoon of ground ginger to hot water. If using fresh ginger (the best way to go!), use ½ teaspoon of peeled, chopped ginger. Add honey to taste.  Cinnamon is high in antioxidants and has antiviral and antibacterial properties.(16) You can either let a stick of cinnamon steep in boiled water to create a cinnamon tea, or just use it as a stirring stick with any other tea. Not only will it help fight off your infection, it will add depth of delicious flavor to your drinks!  , You should be aware that cold temperatures can aggravate some sore throats. If the child does not respond well to this treatment, stop using it. Gather your materials: two cups of Greek yogurt, two to three tablespoons of honey, and one teaspoon of ground cinnamon. Yogurt contains healthy bacteria that can help boost the immune system. The Greek style is tangier and thicker, so it won’t be as drippy as it melts. You can use either a plain yogurt or a fruit one — whichever the child will prefer.   Mix the ingredients in a food processor or mixer until smooth. Pour the mixture into popsicle forms, stopping about ½ inch from the top. Insert the popsicle stick and store it in the freezer for 6-8 hours.  If you just try to yank the popsicle out of its mold, fresh from the freezer, you’ll find yourself holding a popsicle stick with no popsicle. Before pulling on the stick, dip the molds in hot water for five seconds. This loosens up the popsicle a little bit, and makes it easier to remove it from the mold.  You can freeze any of the teas described in this article, as well. Simply pour your cayenne, licorice root, clove, or ginger tea into the mold and freeze for four to six hours. For children, especially, you may want to sweeten the popsicles with honey and/or cinnamon.  When used with very young children, lozenges can pose a choking hazard. In older children and adults, though, they increase the flow of saliva, moisturizing your throat. These lozenges also add ingredients that soothe and heal sore throats. They should last for about six months if stored in a cool, dry, dark place. To make them, gather your ingredients: ½ teaspoon marshmallow root powder; ½ cup slippery elm bark powder; ¼ cup filtered hot water; two tablespoons of medicinal honey.   Dissolve the marshmallow root powder in the hot water. Put the two tablespoons of honey into a glass measuring cup and add enough of the hot marshmallow liquid to have a total of ½ cup. Pour this into a mixing bowl and discard the rest. Add the ½ cup of Slippery Elm Bark powder to a mixing bowl, and create a well in the middle of the powder. Pour the honey/marshmallow solution into the well and mix the ingredients together. They should form small oblong shapes about the size of a grape. Roll the lozenge in some of the extra slippery elm bark powder to reduce their “stickiness,” and place them on a plate to let them dry for at least 24 hours. When dry, wrap each lozenge in waxed paper or parchment paper. To use, just unwrap the lozenge and allow it to slowly dissolve in your mouth.  If it lingers beyond one week, though, it may suggest the infection causing it is serious enough to need medical attention. Furthermore, children, should always be checked out by a doctor if a sore throat doesn't go away with a drink of water in the morning. Call your doctor immediately if your child has trouble breathing or swallowing. Unusual drooling accompanied by a sore throat should also be examined as soon as possible. Adults are better at gauging whether they need medical attention. You can wait it out at home for a few days, but see a doctor if you experience:A sore throat that lasts longer than a week or seems severe Any difficulty swallowing Any difficulty breathing Any difficulty in opening your mouth or pain in the jaw joint Joint pain, especially new pains Earache Any rash A fever higher than 101 F (38.3 C) Any blood in your saliva or phlegm Frequently recurring sore throats A lump or mass in your neck Hoarseness that lasts more than two weeks  , They should resolve on their own within five to seven days. Bacterial infections, however, can be easily treated with antibiotics prescribed by your doctor.   The medical lab’s analysis of your throat swab will determine whether your infection is viral or bacterial.  If you don't take the medication for as long as your doctor prescribes, your symptoms may come back. This is because some antibiotic-resistant bacteria may survive a partial course of antibiotics. If they do, they can increase the population of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in your body. This puts you at risk of complications or a recurrence of the infection.   If antibiotic-resistant bacteria survive in your body, you are more likely to get infected again. This time, you'll need a stronger antibiotic to kill them off.  Antibiotics attack the bacteria causing your infection, but also the healthy bacteria in your gut.Your body needs normal gut bacteria for healthy digestion and a strong immune system. This healthy bacteria is also important for the production of certain vitamins. Yogurts that have "active cultures" contain probiotics — healthy gut bacteria. Eating these products while on antibiotics will you healthy while the antibiotics do their work.   Always look for the term "active cultures" on the yogurt packaging. Pasteurized or otherwise processed yogurts will not help restore gut bacteria.

 Broad beans are available in many different varieties, some more appropriate for your available space. Whether you want to grow broad beans in a small kitchen garden, or a big hoop house, there’s one that's right for the space.Some excellent and hardy varieties:   The Sutton grows only about 12" (30cm) high, making it an excellent choice for smaller gardens, hoop houses, and anywhere space is at a premium.       The Imperial Green Longpod produces huge 15" (40cm) pods, each containing several big beans and are noted for their flavor.       Stero are compact plants that produce heavily if picked regularly. The Stero beans are so sweet they can be eaten without cooking.       Red Epicure produce vibrant red beans that can offer a distinctive and exotic alternative to regular favas or broad beans.       Aquadulce Claudia has been around since the 1850s, winning awards for its flavor and hardiness. This variety is noted for being particularly good to overwinter. Plant Aquadulce Claudia in the winter or late autumn.      ; , Depending on where you live, you may want to plant your broad beans in the late autumn, after you've cleaned up your garden from the summer, which means you'll be harvesting them sometime in the spring when you're ready to start planting other plants. In regions with very cold winters, however, waiting until spring is essential.   Temperate zones: In most regions, you'll want to start broad beans in the early spring to ensure a late summer harvest. Broad beans like to be planted between 60℉ and 65℉ (15-18℃), and struggle in temperatures higher than 80℉ (27℃). Warm Mediterranean climates: Let plants winter-over in areas with mild winters. Fava beans can stay healthy down to temperatures of about 15 °F (−9 °C), making them a good candidate for overwintering in some climates. Because of the long maturation period, planting broad beans in late autumn can ensure that you’re harvesting in early spring. Cold or very hot zones: Start beans indoors in regions with sudden shifts in temperature. If you live in the American Midwest or the Southeast, the transition from winter to summer is often sudden enough that it puts a strain on broad bean varieties, making it a better choice to start your plants indoors, several weeks before putting them in the ground.  Whenever you're planting your beans, plant them in well-tilled soil that's been properly fertilized with the fertilizer of your choice. Since broad beans are nitrogen-producers, you don't necessarily need to fertilize. If you do, use a low-nitrogen fertilizer.   Pick a spot with good sun, away from any plants in the onion family, tilling the ground in the area you're planting several inches deep and working in compost.  Broad beans can grow in any kind of soil, as legumes are self-fertilizers. To help them convert nitrogen, however, it’s a good idea to use Rhizobia bacteria to promote growth and help the roots fix nitrogen. This black powder is available at any gardening store.Wet the seeds lightly and put them in a coffee can or a cup with the inoculant, then shake them gently to coat the seeds evenly before planting. Do this just a few minutes before you're ready to put the seeds in the ground.  Moisten your soil with water gently before planting. You don't want standing water, - just a bit of dampness to get started.   Use your finger to poke a hole about 2" (5 cm) deep in the ground. Place them 8" (20 cm) apart in double rows, with the same distance between the two rows. If you're planting a variety known for growing quite large, you might plant them with a bit more space between. Find the dark spot–the "eye" of the seed–and plant it downward. Some gardeners recommend planting twice as many seeds as you want plants, to allow for non-germinating seeds., If you need to start your beans indoors, a great way to start them is using empty toilet paper tubes, one tube for each plant you hope to grow. Use a seeding tray, available at any gardening store, to line up your tubes and start your broad beans.   Stand the tubes in the tray, fitting snugly. Fill the tubes ⅔ to ¾ full with potting soil. You'll probably spill some in between, but don't worry about the mess. Place one bean on top of the soil in each tube. If you have already germinated the seeds by soaking, place the seed root-down. Water the tubes gently from the top to compact the soil a bit, then fill each tube with a little more soil, covering the beans. Keep the tray at room temperature until the beans sprout, then move the tray to a sunny place. Cool temperatures are fine, just as long as the temperature doesn't dip too much below freezing for long.  The small bushes that the beans will grow on will quickly become laden with heavy pods, and will sag over without the proper support. For this reason, it's important to plant stakes along your broad bean row to use to support them when they start to gain height.   Use small dowels spaced every foot or two along the row, with twine tied between, to give the plants something to lean on. You can use twine, or old strips of bed-sheet to gently tie the plants and keep them upright and keep the pods off the ground. Don't wait until you've got a huge plant and it's flopping over to stake them. It's very easy to damage the roots and promote mildew if the plant spends too much time flopped over on the ground before getting staked up.  Broad beans can withstand dry spells, but keep the plants well-watered, especially if you live in an especially warm climate. Water the soil deeply in the coolest part of the day–first thing in the morning, or in the evening after dinner–and avoid over watering. You shouldn't see a bunch of standing water around your broad beans.   Avoid overhead watering, which is watering the tops of the plants and letting it drip down into the soil. This will promote mildew and other problems. Water the soil.  Broad bean roots are relatively shallow, making it very easy to accidentally uproot them if you're careless with a hoe. Weed around your broad beans by hand, keeping the area competition-free. Once the plant is established, you can lighten up on the weeding some.  The plant will keep growing and will overproduce unless you stunt the growth by pinching off the new sprouts at the top of the plant as soon as you seen pods producing. At this point, you can harvest some of the leaves to eat, which are a surprisingly tender salad green.   Pinch out the growing tips when you see young beans appearing at the base. Remove the tips with two leaves attached from the tops of the plants. If you don't want to eat them, compost them.  If you've got problems with rodents, groundhogs, rabbits, or other pests messing with your garden, broad beans would be a good candidate for row cover, if necessary. Row covers are plastic or cloth sheets that you can stake gently, draped over the plants. This leaves enough room for growth and air circulation, and also warmth.   Row covers can also be a great idea if you're planting in the autumn, because it will help trap the heat near the ground and protect the plants from frost. If you use a row cover, leave the rows uncovered for a while in the middle of the day, maybe while you're weeding to let the air circulate more readily. Watch for fungal disease and wet rot at the base of the plants. If you see any whitish or yellowish patches, water them less and expose the plants to more air.  Aphids love bean plants and will congregate usually at the top of the plants, near new shoots and buds. Some gardeners like to use insecticidal spray to keep aphids off the plants, but an easier method involves cutting the tops off the plants where the aphids congregate as you see them. If you're a diligent gardener, you should be able to pinch them off before they do much damage.  Like other bush beans, broad beans can be tender and edible in the first couple days of their formation, eaten like sugar snap peas, or steamed whole as a side dish. Broad beans are notable for the waxy outer shell on each bean, but harvested young those outer shells will be soft and edible.   Look for a narrow pod that’s bright green. The pods should be thin and narrow, showing none of the bulges that are the sign of mature beans on the inside. If beans are showing, let them mature fully. Don't over-pick your young beans, since the full-grown variety is where the flavor's at. It's ok to pick a few from each plant if you can't wait, but save the majority for full maturation.  Broad beans are ready to be harvested when the pods and plump and the beans are fat and distinct in each pod. The pods will appear to plump some and begin to droop with the weight of the seeds when they're ready to harvest.   Depending on what variety you're growing, pods can be anywhere from 6 to 15 inches long, with several large, fat beans on the inside, with several pods per plant. If you pick them regularly throughout the season, you should open up space for more production as well, if you're had a good growing season, weather-wise.  To get at the broad beans, you've got to shuck them out of their pods. Holding each pod with the pointy tip up, pull the string along the side of each bean to open the pod.   Again, depending on the variety, each bean should have 5-10 large beans in each pod, which have a thick waxy shell that needs removed before eating. It takes some work, but getting organized can help to make the process go fast.The easiest way to do this is to blanch them, dropping the beans in boiling water for a count of five, then removing them immediately with a slotted spoon and putting them right into ice water. This will loosen the shells on each bean.  The best way to eat broad beans is the most simple: steam them and serve them simply dressed with salt and pepper. They're big, meaty, and delicious, ideally paired with red meat. They're also a great base for bean soups, or as an addition to hearty salads.  Because broad bean plants are great nitrogen-providers, it's a good idea to return them back to the soil and let their nutrients enrich the soil. Cut each plant down to the base and dig the roots into the soil. Cover them in soil and rotate your garden so something in need of nitrogen-enrichment is planted there next season.  

select a variety of broad bean to try.  pick a date to sow your beans based on the climate.  prepare the ground with fertilizer.  consider inoculating the seeds to promote growth.  direct sow your seeds or starts in well-tilled, moist soil.  start plants indoors in colder climates.  stake the plants as they start to gain height.  water sparingly and deeply.  weed aggressively, especially if you’re wintering the plants.  when the plant starts producing pods, pinch off new sprouts.  consider using a row cover.  watch out for aphids.  harvest some early to eat them whole.  harvest mature beans when the pods are bright and not over-bulging.  shuck the beans.  enjoy the beans in soups, salads, and other dishes.  return the whole plant to the soil when the beans finish. 

 Depending on the manufacturer, the stripping process can take a few minutes or a few hours, which is generally no sweat since you will be building that 426 Hemi while waiting for the valve covers to de-chrome; ,, Easy-Off oven cleaner can work, but it does have a weird smell, so many prefer chlorine bleach, found in the laundry aisle of your local retailer. Get the cheap stuff, it has no added fragrances and seems to work better for this purpose. Castrol Super-Clean works as well, and it is preferred by most modelers.  Usually about an inch or so will do the trick.  Here's where the airtight part comes in. Since most plastic parts float in bleach, shake the container a little to insure the parts are covered.  If the chrome is hanging tough, replace the lid and wait another hour. If the parts are still shiny after that, leave them in the bleach overnight.  Place them in a container of fresh water to soak. After 30 min. replace the water and allow them to soak another 30 min. 

know that not all plating is created equally.  get an airtight container, such as a prescription bottle.  ,  get the chemical for stripping the chrome.  pour enough bleach into the container to cover the parts.  drop the parts into the bleach and place the lid on securely.  take a look after about an hour.  once the parts are de-chromed, recover them using tweezers.  be sure and dump your container.  

 If you wake up, unless you have to use the bathroom, don't look at the clock or even open your eyes. Sleeping is an ideal way to pass time.   Pretend that you have to wake up when your parents wake up, so you want to fall asleep and sleep in. If you are up hours, or even just an hour before you are allowed to wake up your parents/open presents it will feel like a lot longer as you are waiting in suspense, so keep yourself (quietly) occupied. If you wake up and can't get back to sleep then do a quiet activity that doesn't involve electronics (ie reading, writing, tidying your room).  Open it very slowly. Now, you have more new entertainment.   If you have to wait until everybody's up to do stockings then follow the suggestions in the previous step to keep yourself occupied. By now other excited siblings (if you have siblings) are probably starting to wake up as well. Tell them that you can't wake your parents up yet and suggest things to do such as: make the family breakfast (if you are allowed to use the toaster, jug etc), play a board game, play video games together (quietly!)  , Not just microwave pancakes, go big. French toast, eggs, homemade pancakes/waffles, etc. Then, savor each bite like it's your last.  Siblings are a great way to entertain if you can't leave. You can tell each other stories and play games and do endless things. You could also use electronics. Watch TV, browse the web, etc. You could also read or do homework. Find entertainment in the things you've got. Cleaning might be your best bet because you need room for your gifts.  The steps above are also available. Watch something in the living room. Look around at the gifts. Observe the tree.   If parents/guests/pets/siblings are sleeping refrain from things such as TV, talking on the phone and anything noisy as you may wake sleeping people.  

sleep for as long as possible.  if you can open your stocking, do so.  if you decided to make breakfast and you know your parents would let you, make an elaborate breakfast.  if you have to stay in your room, read this.  if you can leave your room, read this.

 Women may want to draw attention to their shoulders and legs to give an illusion of a narrower waist. You can wear A line dresses, strapless tops with boot cut pants, or slim fitting pants with a larger, loose top that is gathered at the waist.Men will want to give a balance of upper body bulk by wearing open neck shirts, but also by wearing slim-fitting pants.   Pants with wide waist bands or skirts with detail will give a curvier look for your lower body. Men should always look for 'slim fit' suits. Go with suits that have structure and will give the illusion of a slightly broader chest and shoulders.  In women, this body type tends to be athletic. If that’s the case, wearing heels with shorts and skirts will highlight your legs and flatter your figure. If you’re not comfortable wearing heels, try to practice wearing them a few times a week. Make sure you’re walking with your back straight. When you take a step, “roll” your hips to shift your weight from one leg to another.  Tight shirts that highlight your waist are uncomplimentary on a rectangle body type and can make you appear bulky. Similarly, floor-length dresses and skirts that hang loosely to the floor can be unflattering. Instead, wear A-line dresses or mini-skirts to highlight your legs and add curves to your silhouette. 

accentuate your favorite features.  show off your legs with heels!,  avoid wearing unflattering clothing.

 Music has a huge affect on mood and mental state; in addition to the ability to change your emotional state, music can also increase your energy levels. One major study done showed that people who listen to music, regardless of the volume or tempo, were more energized than people who did not. So, grab your iPod or turn on your favorite radio station and crank up some tunes!, Our breathing patterns are altered by our emotional and mental state, even when we aren't aware of it. If you’re stressed and tired, it is likely you are taking “chest” breaths that don’t supply enough oxygen to the brain.   Try breathing in slowly, imagining that you’re filling your stomach with air like a balloon, and then breathing out slowly. Doing this for a minute or longer will help wake up your brain and de-fog your thoughts.  These often talked about nutrients are beneficial for wakefulness, among other things. If you’re pondering your lunch or dinner menu, throw some salmon on your plate and consume all those awesome omega-3 fatty acids. If you’d rather not eat fish that often, substitute with fish oil pills on a daily basis.  Throwing a bucket of cold water on a sleeping friend isn’t just a great prank, it actually helps to wake them up. If you can’t seem to do anything to stay away, splash your face with cold water or hop in a cold shower. The cool temperature and feeling of the water will improve circulation and have you concentrating a bit better than before.  Fiber, unlike many of the foods we eat, takes a very long time to digest fully. Therefore, eat some fiber-filled foods and allow them to slowly release energy into your body over the course of the day. Try out an apple with the skin, some black beans, or a bran cereal and let go of your weary ways., Long naps during the day can disrupt your sleep later in the night, but taking short, timed naps in the afternoon can be just what your body needs to refresh itself. A veritable reboot can be performed by taking a nap that is 20 minutes long. This is just enough time for your body to fall asleep and kick out fatigue-causing stressors that have built up in your mind.  Your sleepiness could indeed be due to a basic lack in vitamins and minerals. If you aren’t getting enough magnesium in your diet, try taking a magnesium supplement. These are available at most health food stores and can be taken on a daily basis.  If you have a messy desk, ongoing argument with a friend, or an overwhelming amount of work to do, it could be stressing you out and making you more tired than you normally would be. Deal with the stressors you are aware of, whenever you are able. Managing anxiety-provoking things as they pop up will improve your overall mental health, as well as keep you focused throughout the day.  Studying or working in bed or on a comfy couch is a great way to make yourself tired. Rather than imposing fatigue on yourself by staying in a location that is much too comfortable, move to a place you are less likely to fall asleep in. Working in a coffee shop or at a hard desk will make it much more difficult to want to sleep than piles of cozy blankets and pillows will. 

listen to some music.  try a breathing exercise.  eat omega-3s.  try water therapy.  consume some fiber.  take a catnap.  take a magnesium supplement.  deal with stress.  change your environment. 

 There are a number of great resources to help you better understand depression. These resources can often help with a self-diagnosis, but seeing a doctor is better because even the most intelligent people can easily misdiagnose themselves and a medical professional would look for other possible causes first. You can use a variety of tools you can use to understand more about this disorder.   Online surveys can help identify if you are depressed. They ask questions about your lifestyle, and often include multiple-choice questions to determine how you are feeling. Some surveys include a scale survey that allows you to place yourself on a scale of feelings. Brochures or pamphlets can provide statistics, references, and resources. Many public places like libraries, clinics, and universities have brochures and pamphlets on common illnesses. They often include short informational material like brochures that can give you a quick look at the disease. Non-profits or other recognized organization sometimes specialize in health disorders. Their websites will often provide helpful frequently asked questions. Organization like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) provide information on their websites about depression and other mental disorders. These websites can provide research and scholarly information.  If you think you may be depressed, you may want to visit your doctor. Even specialty doctors such as OBGYNs, Endocrinologists, and Pediatricians have the resources and know-how to diagnose mental disorders like depression.  In the end, you can be your own best research advocate. Take the time to research depression on your own using reliable materials. You can visit a library or an online research database to help you in your search.   You can review the Diagnostic Statistic Manual (DSM), which is the leading book on mental health. It is the standard on classifying mental disorders and can be accessed by the public. JSTOR.org is an open database that allows you to review journals, newspapers, and books. This is a great scholarly resource that you can use to research depression symptoms and treatments.  

reflect and diagnose yourself.  see your doctor.  research the signs and symptoms. 

 When starting a new diet or eating pattern, it can be helpful to journal your current eating and lifestyle habits so you're aware of what changes you need to make. Note what foods and beverages you consume, plus the timing of your meals.   Purchase a journal or download a journaling app on your smartphone. Track as many days as you can. Ideally, track weekdays as well as weekend days. Many people eat slightly different on weekends compared to a more structured work day.Go beyond just jotting down the foods you eat. Make notes about how often you eat out and any patterns you see arising. For example, on a day you work late, are you more likely to stop at a fast food restaurant instead of making dinner at home? Also note where you think you can improve or make better choices. For example, are you choosing the healthiest options possible for your meals or snacks? Do you eat a lot of frozen, processed foods or are you eating mostly home cooked meals?; , Overeating and indulging in larger portion sizes (even of healthy foods) can lead to excess calorie intake and weight gain.Track the portion sizes of your meals and snacks to get an idea if you should decrease or maintain your serving sizes.   Decreasing portion sizes can be a simple way to cut a few calories from your day and aid in moderate weight loss.Compare your portion sizes throughout the day to the recommended standards. For example, one serving of fruit is 1/2 cup or one small whole fruit, one serving of vegetables is one cup, one serving of grains is 1 oz or 1/2 of a cup, one serving of lean protein is 3 oz and one serving of low-fat dairy is one cup (milk and yogurt) or 2 oz of cheese.A lot of grocery stores have pre-portioned tupperware to help you control your portions with less effort. Consider investing in measuring cups or a food scale to help you accurately record your portion sizes. Portion sizes might be an another item that you can add to your food journal.  Monitoring your total calories each day can also give you another perspective of your diet. Knowing how many calories you generally eat on an average day can give you clues to what you can cut out of your diet to help induce weight loss.   Safe weight loss, or losing one to two pounds per week, requires you to cut out about 500 calories daily.Cutting out more than 500 calories daily or eating less than 1200 calories daily is not safe or healthy and may not result in weight loss long-term.While cutting and burning additional calories may seem like a good idea to lose weight faster, it can have very negative long-term health effects and can actually lead to long-term weight gain. Although weight loss and healthy eating go beyond calories, it's important to be calorie aware — knowing whether or not you're eating enough calories for your body and lifestyle. Burning additional calories through exercise is helpful but make sure that if you are exercising, you don't eat too little. Recognize the limitations of calorie counting. Not all calories are created equal, and calorie estimates on the label can be off.Carefully counting calories also increases the stress hormone cortisol, which may lead to cravings and weight gain., About 75% of the time people overeat, it's in response to emotions.It's important to be aware of what emotions trigger you to eat and how they specifically affect your eating or lifestyle behaviors.   Take notes about your food/mood connection. For example, you may notice on days you feel more stressed, you're more likely to reach for a salty, high fat snack. Try rating your mood on a scale from 1-10 each time you start a journal entry. Also consider the times of day or night when you have the hardest time avoiding junk food or mindless snacking. Is it late at night while you sit and watch TV? Do you crave the need for something when you are driving? Knowing what your weak points are will help you plan for ways to alter your eating habits.  There are some commercial diets that are appropriate for safe and healthy weight loss. These might be beneficial as many programs offer a very detailed plan, recipes and support.   Choose a diet plan that does not focus on eliminating large groups of foods or entire food groups. Look for programs that focus on monitoring portion sizes, eating a balanced diet and incorporating regular physical activity. Examples of programs that offer safe weight loss include: a diet based on a Mediterranean style of eating; the DASH diet (great for high blood pressure); a higher protein, moderate carbohydrate diet; or a diet that focuses on balanced meals and portion sizes.  Speaking to a doctor or registered dietitian prior to starting any new diet regimen is a smart idea. They may be able to provide you with additional guidance or recommend alternatives that might be more appropriate for your health.   Speak with your primary care doctor. She may refer you to a local dietitian for additional help. A registered dietitian is a nutrition expert that may give you a more effective diet for weight loss. They may be able to come up with a meal plan tailored to your lifestyle that will help induce weight loss. It's also nice to visit your dietitian regularly to have some accountability through the weight loss process. Visit the EatRight website and click on the orange "Find an Expert" button on the top right to search for a dietitian in your area.  

track your meals in a food journal.  measure your portion sizes.  consider calories.  journal about cravings or emotions that trigger you to eat.  choose a well-balanced diet plan.  meet with your doctor or registered dietitian. 

 Once you have obtained the required amount of practical training, you will need to pass three tests administered by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).A Designated Mechanic Examiner will test your practical skills. The Examiner will also administer an oral exam – you'll answer his questions in person, while he takes notes. There are 43 different technical topics that you'll need to be familiar with in order to pass these tests. For a single certificate exam (airframe or power plant), expect the test to last about 8 hours.  You will need to go to your local Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) office and submit proof that you have all the required experience for certification. If the FAA inspector determines that you are eligible to take the written exam, you can schedule your exam at one of the approved computer testing centers. There are testing centers in most large towns and cities in the US.Study very carefully for your written exam. If you fail any part of the test, you'll need to wait at least 30 days before taking it again. The 30-day wait requirement may be waived if you can show proof that you've gotten additional training in the area you failed. Every section of the written exam must be passed within 24 months of your first attempt.  You can get a license in a power plant rating, an airframe rating, or both. you are a US citizen and want to work as an aircraft mechanic in the United States, you must meet certain basic standards. You will need a mechanic's certificate to work as an aircraft mechanic. You must be 18 years of age, or older. You must be able to speak, write, read, and comprehend English. You must have 18 months of practical experience with airframes or power plants, or 30 months of practical experience working on both power plants and airframes at the same time. You must pass the required practical, oral, and written exams.  If you aren't a US citizen, you can still qualify for a mechanic's certificate if you meet all of the US citizen standards, along with some additional requirements.You'll need to prove that you need a mechanic's certificate to work on US-registered civil aircraft. You will need to show your non-US passport to the examiner. Your employer will need to write a letter explaining exactly what aircraft mechanical work you performed for him, and for how long. You will need a letter from the foreign equivalent of the FAA listing your qualifying work experience, or a letter to this effect from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). All papers must be dated and signed, and must be the original document – no copies are allowed. You'll need to pay a fee to have your documents reviewed by FAA officials. English-language requirements are occasionally waived if you will not be working within the US. In this situation, your license would limit you to work outside the US.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also issues repairman certificates, which restrict the bearer to specific tasks (such as repairing a specific type of engine or engine component, for a specific type of aircraft). The work is performed for commercial operators, FAA-approved repair stations, or air carriers that have been approved to do this kind of work. The requirements for a repairman certificate are:Your employer will need to recommend you for a repairman certificate before you can apply. You'll need to be 18 or older. You must be able to write, read, understand, and speak the English language. You will need work experience that qualifies you to perform maintenance on aircraft or parts. You must already be employed on a specific job that requires qualifications by an FAA-certified Repair Station, air carrier, or commercial operator. You will need 18 months of on-the-job experience in the specific job that you will be doing with your repairman certificate, or you will need to complete a school training course at an FAA-approved facility.  

pass the oral and practical examinations.  pass the written exam.  get a mechanic's license from the federal aviation administration (faa).  get a mechanic's license from the federal aviation administration (faa) requirement if you are not a us citizen.  get a repairman certificate, if you are already on the job. 

 Cast a wide net and look for a variety of different summer camps before making your final decision. Search for summer camps around where you live and look at their individual websites. Find a couple of camps that fit what your child wants to do, and then write them down so that you can give them options.   You can find camps on the American Camp Association's website, Summercamps.com, and Kidscamps.com.Most camp websites will have photos of previous summers as well as lists of programs that they provide. Read online reviews using websites like Campratingz and Glassdoor., Ask the camp director or look on the camp's website to see if transportation, meals, insurance, special trips, entrance fees, health services, or use of equipment is included in the tuition.Make sure to allocate money for additional costs. If the camp you are researching can't meet all of your child's health needs then you'll have set up special arrangements with the camp staff or find a camp that has the experience to deal with your child's needs.   If your child has special dietary or health needs, check to see if the camp you have in mind has the capability to care for them properly., When considering summer camps make sure to choose one that is within your budget. Once you find camps that fit your child's needs, take a look at how much they cost weekly. Many camps also have financial aid for low-income families.Day camp can cost anywhere from $100 to $500 a week. Specialized summer camps that teach children new skills like sports, science, or the performing arts can cost anywhere from $500 to $1,000 per week. The average cost of sleepaway camp is $690 per week., A good way to get reviews on camps is to talk to other parents that have sent their children to camp in previous summers. Sometimes, they will be able to share experiences and give you insight into how the camp normally operates. They can also tell you if the experience was enriching or educational for their child.   If another parent gives a camp a horrible review or has had a bad experience, it may be a good idea to consider a different camp.  Make sure that the camp program doesn't interfere with any family vacations or commitments your child has for the summer. It's best to start early when searching for camps. Often, registration deadlines will be earlier in the year. Make sure that you're still able to register, and talk to your child about camp before the registration deadline hits.If you can't find any information on registration deadlines, give the camp a call and inquire there. If you do have a schedule conflict, ask the camp director if your child can leave camp early or take a hiatus for what they need to do.  

research camps online.  determine what is included in tuition.  choose a camp within your budget.  speak to other parents about their experiences with different camps.  pick a camp that fits your schedule. 

 You can evict a tenant if the proper grounds for eviction exist. The most common ground for eviction is typically the nonpayment of rent due. Other grounds for eviction relate to any violation of the lease agreement, as well as violations of local, state or federal laws by the tenant while on the premises of the leased property.   Some of the most common lease agreement violations include:Having additional occupants who are not named in the rental agreement living at the leased premises. Having pets when there is a no-pets policy. Selling drugs on the lease premises, as well as any other tenant action that creates an uninhabitable living environment for others.   If you live in a private home with no written lease agreement stating grounds for eviction, you can be evicted for any reason at all so long as it is not discrimination based on sex, race, creed, color, national origin, age, handicap, marital status, HIV status, or children.If you live in public housing, for example Section 8 housing, the grounds for eviction are extremely narrow.; , Once your eviction case is before the court, the tenant will have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony. Your eviction case could fail if the tenant proves that you as the landlord have also violated the lease agreement, and/or the tenant’s acts underlying the eviction were conducted in order to mitigate your lease violations. Make sure that the court has no reason to reject your eviction case, and ensure that you:   Review the lease agreement in order to determine and understand what is required of you under the lease. Conduct all feasible and necessary repairs in order to maintain a habitable living space. Comply with all relevant building, safety, health and housing codes. Maintain common areas in a safe and sanitary manner. Follow the applicable Florida state and local eviction procedures.  Before officially starting the eviction process, you should first attempt to handle the issue without the use of the court system. There is no reason to waste the time and energy associated with filing an eviction complaint if the issue underlying the eviction is just a misunderstanding that could be solved with an open and honest conversation. Write the tenant a letter reminding him or her of the lease conditions, and that you have the right to file an eviction complaint if the relevant lease violations are not remedied.Send the letter certified mail in order to have documentation that you attempted to handle the eviction issue. This documentation can later be submitted as evidence in support of your eviction complaint.  

determine whether eviction grounds exist.  make sure that you have not violated any of the lease terms.  send the tenant a warning letter. 

 If you can’t bring yourself to get rid of your cat, try making him an outside cat. This will limit your exposure to him. You can keep your cat in a cattery or cat house, located in the garden. This allows him freedom to roam outdoors during the day.  A reduction in the cat dander in the areas of the house where you spend most of your time will aid your allergies. Don't allow the cat to enter your bedroom at any time. Since you sleep here, you will breath in cat dander all night if he/she is hanging around in there. Keep the doors shut to any rooms you don't want cats to enter.   You have to keep this up at all times. Any cat dander can aggravate your allergies. Plus, the more everyone does it, the more it'll become an ingrained habit., To test if your cat is really causing your allergies, send him away to stay with someone else for a month or two. Clean your house very well when he leaves to get rid of all the dander and clean it at least once a week in case any dander remains. Track your allergy symptoms over this time period, noting how they change.   If he is really the problem, you should see a change in your allergies pretty quickly., Although your cat will likely not enjoy it, you should have him bathed once a week. This can be done by a household member who isn't allergic. If you live by yourself, look into paying for a cat groomer to do it. try to wash you cat a maximum of twice a week as washing them creates tangles in their fur and dries out their skin.   Also consider using allergen reducing shampoos. These help cut down on how much dander your cat will shed on a daily basis., To cut down on shedding, brush or comb your cat's fur thoroughly each day for 10 to 15 minutes. Make sure you discard the fur after each grooming. To avoid spreading allergens inside your home, do this outside. If possible, have a non-allergic member of your household do this for you.   Grooming will improve the texture of the cat's coat, which will help remove all sources of allergens from the cat’s spittle, any outdoor pollen and dirt, and anything else the cat has brushed up against. Although this doesn’t reduce the allergens, it may reduce the spread of them by reducing the amount your cat sheds. 

keep the cat out of the house.  designate cat-free zones.  try a separation period.  have the cat bathed weekly.  groom the cat daily. 

 You'll have a hard time hitting a target that you're blind to.   An example of a good purpose is, "Experience this character's feelings during the course of this book" or "Figure out exactly what I don't know about this subject." Setting a purpose "activates" your brain. When you have a clear purpose, your brain searches for all the references and ideas it can that will help you achieve your purpose.; , Peaceful and quiet places will help you focus on the book. If you're in a crowded place, you will be distracted or disturbed by the things that are going around you. Also, make sure your place has a lot of light so you'll be able to see the words clearly.  Make sure it's comfortable and has good lighting. A small table nearby is handy. You can even add a small box full of book favorites by the couch.  If you want to be a successful reader, it's recommended you turn off electronics while you are reading, unless you're using device such as a Kindle. This will distract you a lot and you will not be able to focus. Not only electronics, but anything else that might distract you and make you unable to read.  Make sure you have a book that's just right for you. If you like comedy, get a funny book. If you like fantasy, get a book about fairy tales or fantasy. If you get a book that's not right for you, you may lose interest in the book and won't want to read it.   Reading a small section of a book is helpful for deciding its value to you. If you're thinking of buying a book, why not head to your local library and check it out? Different genres appeal to different readers, so browse around. You might prefer an audiobook.  There is a difference between giving the book a chance and being halfway through the book and still hating the story or information it depicts. If you think you are not enjoying a book that you have picked stop reading it, because if you keep on at it, it will put you off reading. Try a different book that you might enjoy more.   If you found it boring because it was too hard, try an easier one. Or vice versa, if you wish to challenge yourself more.  Imagine what the characters are feeling and what their next moves might be before you find out what the author actually has them do.  If Junie B. Jones was making mischief, would you make the situation brighter or dimmer?  , Your version doesn't have to match what the author describes exactly, and it's okay if they have the face of somebody you know.  Pick some delicious food such as parfaits, salad, fruit smoothie, or even chopped up fruit. This trick can raise your mood. A special drink is nice, too - hot chocolate, lemonade, tea, etc.  If it is a rainy day, cuddle up with a blanket and a favorite stuffed animal. It will make you feel appreciated.  Example: In that situation, I would... If you remember a similar situation think about what you did in it, and compare to a character's decision.  Reading makes you a lot smarter. If you read every once in a while, you may forget about it and not continue reading.  

establish your purpose.  have a nice place to read.  find a small place where you can set up your reading center.  keep distractions to a minimum.  choose a good book.  don't force yourself to read something you're not enjoying at all.  imagine in your mind the setting of what you're reading.  imagine what would happen in the situation if you were there.  visualize the characters.  enjoy a snack with your book.  get comfortable.  put yourself in the main character's shoes.  read every day. 

 It by no means has to be perfect -- it only has to outline what you want to say. Cover all the main points with supporting evidence, but don't worry about transitions now. Have a general idea of your purpose in mind.   Having a paper to work off of makes it much easier to see the overall arc of your work. Without it, all the information is just floating around in your head, unorganized. Keep in mind which points are strongest and which are weakest. If any just don't seem to fit right, throw them out now.  Before your paper, you had "pollution is bad." An idea to start off with, but definitely not anything revelatory. Now, hopefully, you can narrow it down -- "Consumption by the world's largest economies needs to be cut in half by 2020" is much better.   How do all your points agree? What does their agreement say that you didn't necessarily set out to write? Does their agreement expose anything to strengthen your argument?  , Now that you've found out what it is exactly you're writing about, go. Come out with it right out of the gate. Your introduction will be direct and to the point; you can deal with the details later.   Consider the following example: "The illusion of power drives men to do many things. It causes them to go mad, to destroy, and to distrust.

, It is on the third floor of the castle, in the same type of door that the first two bowser battles were in, and on the same floor as Tick Tock Clock, Rainbow ride, and the secret level Wing Mario Over the Rainbow., You have to get behind him, grab his tail, spin him around using the control stick on your controller, and throw him into a bomb located on the side of the arena., He'll most likely spin around to keep track of you so that he can attack in your direction, but don't be alarmed., His most commonly used attack is his fire breath. When he does this attack, he faces one direction and keeps facing that direction as he breathes the fire. This is the perfect opportunity for you to maneuver around him and grab his tail with B., Remember that the more speed you gain, the farther he'll fly. However, it'll be harder to aim if you move too fast. This is perfected with practice., If he falls off, he'll come back up, and break a piece off of the side of the arena. Watch for the shockwaves that will also be on the ground, and try avoiding them by jumping over them. This is easier if you are farther away from where Bowser lands.,,, Don't worry, it's still possible to defeat him at this point.,, Mario will then be wearing a wing cap. Now, enjoy the ending sequence and celebrate beating the final boss of Super Mario 64! 

collect 70 stars from the various levels in the castle.  ,  know where the final battle with bowser is located.  know that the same method is used in fighting bowser as the first two times.  know most commonly used method to grab bowser's tail is running around bowser in circles.  recognize his most commonly used attack.  spin bowser around using the control stick.  avoid worrying if you miss the bomb.let go of his tail using the b button, and throw him into a bomb on the edge of the stage.repeat this process once again when he comes back up.  know that after the second time you succeed in throwing him into a bomb, parts of the stage will collapse and form a star shape.repeat this process a third time.  collect the giant star that bowser turns into. 

 Business is a game of carefully calculated risk-taking. If you can't handle the pressure of making crucial decisions that could potentially sink your business on a daily basis, you're not ready for the business world. Approach each decision by assessing what the worst-case outcome of that decision would be. In other words, what's the worst that could happen? Use that knowledge to make decisions by weighing risk and potential reward. Keep in mind that you can learn from your mistakes and use what you learn from them to succeed later on.Another key aspect of getting into the right mindset is recognizing that there is a lot that you don't know. You should always be open to learning new ideas and incorporating them into your business practices.; , Your business won't make any money if you're constantly taking out your earnings and spending them. Actually, your business may not make any money at all for a considerable period of time. That is why you have to stay focused and keep working to implement your business plan. Keep on making and achieving those short term goals until it clicks and your momentum drives your business to success.Once you have started making money, continue to live as if you still aren't making it. Any money that you can reinvest into the business will only help it to grow and increase your potential future income streams., Read magazine and newspaper articles that relate to your business interests or business. Follow famous leaders or innovators related to your industry on social media and stay up to date on their thoughts and actions. Attend seminars, join trade associations, and subscribe to publications. Read every relevant book that you can find. Only by learning and staying up to date can you learn where the market is going next and how to innovate past it., Divide your list into short term and long term goals. The short term goals should be a path to achieving the long term goals. For example, for the long term goal of the starting the business you write down short term goals like gain financing and write a business plan. You could then break these short term goals down even further into actionable steps.   Writing down goals and actions to complete will also help you keep your business organized later on. You don't want to forget some crucial action that must be taken simply because you weren't organized enough to remember it., The idea for a business can come from a variety of sources. Perhaps you've noticed a problem in your life or the life of someone close to you that lacks a solution. Or maybe the industry that you've worked in for years is in need of a shakeup. Alternately, maybe you're just looking for a business idea that you can sell to customers and make profitable. Brainstorm ideas for days or weeks and come up with a list of reasonable ideas. When you have a list, consider, for each business idea:   Who are your potential customers? How would you set up the business model? Where are you going to get your supplies/materials from? Do you know enough about this industry to make it work?, No business, especially a small one, can appeal to all customers. In fact, a business is usually defined by the customers or markets they choose not to serve. To become successful, you'll have to identify the niche in the market where your audience is. Start by thinking of what type of customers you want to serve. Are they individuals or businesses? Then, look at the problem your business is solving from their perspective. What type of solutions do they want and how should it be done? Then, you can work within this niche to sell to your customers. Just make sure that your niche is substantial enough to sustain your growth., The first step to actually starting a business is to write a business plan for it. This will give you a basic structure that you can use to plan your goals and decisions. Keep in mind that this plan can be edited over time as you learn new strategies and adapt to your market.   At minimum, a business plan should include a summary of the plan, a business description, market strategies, an analysis of competition, a growth plan, operation and management plans, and how financing will be acquired.See how to write a business plan for more information.  A break-even analysis tells you, quite simply, how long your business will have to be running to turn a profit. This is a helpful tool for understanding how much money you will need to invest before the business even has potential to see a return. This can help you plan for financing and create a timeline for repaying any debt that you may take on when starting the business.If your business plan doesn't break even soon enough, consider reducing expenses by working from home, using less expensive materials, or reducing your number of employees. Alternately, you can increase your product's price., Successful entrepreneurs surround themselves with other successful people. They tend to feed off of their associates' energy and success to enhance their own. Make everyone you spend time with other successful, positive people. Make sure to avoid negative people or those who are chronically unsuccessful., Be on the lookout for industry events in your area or major ones that you can plan to travel to. This may include annual conventions or meet ups organized on social media. By attending these events, you will be able to increase awareness of your business, make new connections, initiate new deals, meet potential new hires, and learn about current events in your field., Constantly explain your business to people you meet and ask them about theirs. Then, ask them how you can send customers over to their business. This creates a more powerful connection with the other business owner that you can hopefully one day convert into additional growth for your own business. That said, you should not expect anything in return from these people., Some of your connections may not immediately, or ever, turn into business expansion opportunities. However, it is important to maintain all relationships. Opportunities can come from unexpected places, so you need to be ready when they do. Keep in touch will all contacts on a regular basis, either through emails, phone calls, or social media. Even if a connection doesn't seem valuable now, who knows where they'll be in a couple of years., You have to have an online presence to succeed in today's market. Having a website is the most important thing to do first. Then, you can also start a blog and make social media accounts. This helps you interact with customers and reach new ones outside of your initial area.You may also be able to earn money from advertising on your blog or create a fully online store for your products.  Your business can grow by word of mouth, but it will grow much faster if you advertise. Make compelling advertisements for your products or services that grab the attention of your audience. Make sure that the platforms that you use for marketing match the platforms that your niche will actually be using. Otherwise, your advertising expenditures will be wasted.See how to advertise and how to advertise your business for free for more information.  Excellent customer service is crucial to having a successful business. Make sure that you and all of your employees treat your customers with respect and try to make each customer happy. Your customers will be also best able to tell you what you're doing right or wrong, so listen to their feedback. This can be either through their actions or through a survey.   Listen to your customers when you are developing new products or services that you could offer or when you are making improvements to existing products. In addition, you should definitely eliminate any unpopular products or services from your lineup. In particular, write down any instances in which customers ask if you offer a certain product or service. Add the most commonly asked-for items to your offerings., What do your close competitors do? How are their products priced compared to yours? What diversification or growth paths have they taken? Any of this information can help you adapt your own practices to either distinguish yourself or become more or line with your successful competition. To get this information, you can visit the other businesses' websites or talk to customers that may have had experience with your competitors.   In addition, be sure to keep an ear out for new competitors or those from other markets, like online business., Your research of competitors, other successful entrepreneurs, and the market should tell you that the keys to growth are diversification and market expansion. That is, you should strive to offer your customers more options and also seek out new sources of customers. These new customers can either be in a different niche than where you started or a different geographical location. New products can be complementary (go naturally with your current products) or a completely new offering, depending on what your customers want. Listen to your customers, watch the competition, and read industry journals to get ideas for expansion or diversification opportunities. 

get the right attitude.  stay focused and keep spending under control.  stay updated with your industry.  develop a habit of writing your goals down as a list and making daily actions to achieve them.  brainstorm business ideas.  pick a niche market and conquer it.  write a business plan.  do a break-even analysis.  keep good company.  attend conventions or industry meet ups.  send business to new connections.  maintain existing relationships.  create an online presence for your business.  promote your services or products through marketing.  provide excellent customer service and listen to your customers.  study your competition.  be on the lookout for business opportunities to expand, grow, or diversify your business. 

 You need a clean environment to prevent dust and dirt from mixing with the tinting. Doing everything indoor is not a bad idea. But if you want to work outside, you should choose a clean and dry place.       ; , Remove any stickers inside of your car screen and clean off all the adhesives or any sticky things that can create problems with the film sticking on the windows. Remove all the obstructions inside the car that can restrict your process and get in your way. Finally, vacuum the interior to get rid of dust.  Lower the window slightly so that you can get the top as well. Mix a few drops of dish soap with warm water and spray or wipe it on the window, then use the blade to scrape away all the dirt and grime. Make sure you clean both sides of the window well, removing everything.          Never use Windex, or cleaner with ammonia in it. It will tint your windows purple when you're done. Make sure you get all the edges and seals, and role the window up to get the bottom. You're going to need almost a gallon of soapy water throughout this process. Prepare the water ahead of time to make working easier. A spray bottle is highly recommended.  Wipe away the soapy water on both sides and dry off the edges as well. If you're using a spray bottle, refill it with more soapy water. A squeegee will help you get the window completely dry.          You will need a plenty of soapy water to ensure that the tint doesn't stick or rip. Make sure you get underneath the seals in the interior of the car. Use your finger to get under the seal and remove dirt and dust.  You'll need to move the window up and down as you work. For now, leave it up.  Like a sticker, the tint has a layer that can be peeled off right before adhering it to the window. Make sure, as you work with the tint, that this side is facing you.  The water will help the tinting temporarily adhere, but still make it slippery enough to slide around and put into place.  Unroll your tinting so that it covers the entire window, with at least 2-3" of extra tinting over the edges. The liner (the part that will later adhere to the window), should be facing you.          Make sure you do not remove the liner -- you're just sizing and pressing the tinting right now, now adhering it.  You should have a few inches of extra tint in every direction, but you don't want to be maneuvering the entire roll of film while working. Use a precision knife or blade to cut a usable square of tinting film from the larger role.  Once the tint is cut into a square, it should stick to the water on the outside of the window. You should then spray the tint itself so that the entire thing is covered in a thin layer of soapy water.  Simply use the edges of the window to trace your knife across the tinting film. You want a perfectly shaped line to ensure the tint fits. When done, two of the edges should fit perfectly, and the rest should still be square.          As you cut, use the squeegee or your free hand to make sure the film is flush with the window. When done, cut the excess film away and discard.  You want to shift the film towards the edge you just cut. This ensures that you have enough tint to cover every edge of the window, including the part covered by the seal.  Once you slice the right edge off, pull the tint partially back to the center, so that there is roughly 1/2" of extra tinting film on either side of the window.  This is the tint that will eventually go into the door, allowing you a better light seal. Slide it down and then use the squeegee to flatten it again. You'll be doing the same thing you just did with the right and left side on the top and bottom edges.  Once the window is lowered, you can use this top edge of the window as your guide. Use the precision knife to cut right to the top of the window. When done, pull the tint back towards the center. You should have roughly 1/2" of extra film on every side of the window.  When cutting away, the corners may have bits and pieces of extra film in the corners. Use your knife to clean it all up.  You may need to reapply water to make it stick. If so, remove the cut tint, spray some more soapy water, and reapply the film to the window.  Get out all the air and water by working from the top downward. Smooth the entire film out on the outside of the window. As you push to the bottom, you'll see zig-zagging from the "fingers" of air still stuck in the film. This is a good sign. Keep pushing downward, then run the heat gun along the bottom of the window to make sure it is all dried out.          You can leave the tint stuck to the outside of the window now. You'll have to prep the inside window a bit more, so this is a good place to ensure that the tint stays dust free.  You're going to go through a lot of soapy water in this process. You can use a hard edge to get in between the seal and the window for a better clean. When done, spray the whole window with soapy water.  Window tint works just like a sticker. There is a removable layer that adheres to the tint and keeps the adhesive solid. You should, however, only peel off only the top half for now-- it makes it easier to work with.          Just gently work the tint between two fingers like you were snapping to get the adhesive layer off.  You are now ready to adhere the tint to the window.  The water makes the tint easy to slide around, so you can get the edge of the window perfectly lined up with the top edge of the tint. Your window should still be slightly down.  Once the top edge is on the window, sneak the two sides into the seals to the right and left, using your fingers to get them roughly flush. With one hand, pull back the seal around the window, then use the other hand to push the film under the seal and onto the window.          Remember to keep everything doused in soapy water to make it easier to move around.  Using your squeegee or hard-edge, slowly work the water out by pushing the water to the sides. Push the water out the top and sides, but don't push towards the bottom, where you have the rest of you liner waiting to be adhered.          You should keep a hand on the tint at all times to keep it from moving as you squeegee the water out.  Don't skimp on the soapy water -- it is essential to prevent the tint from sticking.  Make sure both the window and the tint are wet.  Spray off the tint with soapy water again. This is tricky, but should be easy with a hard edge. Pull back the seal with your fingers, then use the hard edge to push the film down and onto the window.  Work downward and outward whenever possible, spraying the tint with more soapy water to make sure you don't rip the liner. Keep squeegeeing the water out of the tinting so that it is smooth, as if it was just a part of the window.        

find a clean, dry work space.  remove any stickers or adhesives from the windows.  clean up the windows using soapy water and a 1" razor blade.  take a clean rag and dry the window.  roll the window back up before beginning, but leave your car on.  determine which side of the tint is adhesive.  spray the outside of the window with soapy water.  place the tinting over the outside of the window so that it covers the entire window.  cut away a manageable slab of tinting.  spray the front of the film with water.  take your knife and cut along the bottom and left edges of the window.  pull the film 1" towards the left edge.  cut the right edge, then slide the tint halfway back towards the center.  pull the film down roughly one inch, so the bottom edge is lower than the window.  lower the window a half inch, then use the top of the window to cut the film to shape.  clean up any of the corners that have excess film.  realign your film so that it fits the window perfectly, with some excess on every edge.  working from the top down, use a heat gun and a hard card to push the bubbles to the bottom.  prep the inside of the window with soapy water and a squeegee.  peel off the top half of the release liner from the tinting film.  spray off the now-exposed section with fresh water.  line up and adhere the top of the tint to the window.  slightly fold the tint to work it underneath the seal.  spray down the window again, then use your hard edge to push the water out the edges.  roll the window up, then spray the bottom half of the window with soapy water.  pull of the remaining release layer, then spray the exposed tint with water.  use your fingers and hard edge to tuck the bottom of the tint into the bottom seal.  smooth out the window with your hard edge, pushing all the water and air bubbles towards the edges. 

 Authentic Turkish carpets are hand-knotted, and can take months or even years to complete.   Understand the 2 types of knots used in Turkish rug weaving. The double knot, also called a Gordes knot or Turkish knot, provides the most durable carpet. In a double knot, a strand of yarn encircles 2 threads. The single knot, also called a Sennah knot or Persian knot, encircles 1 thread. Examine the underside of the rug for imperfections. The underside of a hand-knotted rug will show some imperfections in the knots. If the back of the rug is perfect, it probably was made by a machine, not a person.  The higher the KPSI, the higher the quality. Approximately 150 KPSI is considered average, while fine Turkish rugs may have KPSI counts of 500 or more.   Examine the design on the underside of the rug. The greater the number of knots, the more distinctive the design will be on the back of the rug.  Turkish rugs and flatweaves are made from 5 materials: sheep wool, goat hair, silk, floss silk and cotton. Select rugs made from natural materials, which are more durable than synthetic materials.   Consider Turkish carpets made from wool. Wool carpets are the most traditional type of Turkish rug, and are woven by hand in countryside villages. Wool quality varies by region and climate, with the higher quality wool coming from sheep found in cooler and higher elevations. The wool typically is hand-spun using a drop spindle, called a kirmen, and spinning wheels. Evaluate silk Turkish carpets. The silk used in Turkish rugs comes from silk cocoons. When unrolled, the single thread from a silk cocoon can stretch up to 25,000 meters (82,021 feet). The silk fibers are strong and can be twisted easily. Because of the fine fiber, silk rugs can feature about 625 KPSI. Large silk Turkish carpets can take up to 6 years to complete. Consider floss silk Turkish rugs. Often referred to as art silk, floss silk is mercerized cotton that has a sheen similar to silk. It is used primarily in rugs woven in Kayseri. Evaluate goat hair carpets. While historians believe that Turkish carpets were originally woven with goat hair, very few rugs today are made with goat hair. Occasionally, goat hair will be used in the bindings of Turkish carpets. Consider cotton Turkish carpets. Cotton is usually considered more resistant and less elastic than wool, so tighter knots can be achieved. Cotton is used primarily for creating flatweave Kilim rugs, although it can be used to create hand-knotted Turkish carpets as well.    Evaluate natural dyes. Authentic Turkish carpets are made from natural dyes extracted from vegetables, roots, flowers and insects. Natural dyes provide greater authenticity and will increase the rug's value. However, natural dyes will mellow over time. Evaluate synthetic dyes. Synthetic dyes are available in a wider range of colors than natural dyes. However, unlike naturally dyed fibers, synthetic fibers don't hold dye throughout the entire fiber. A closer examination of a Turkish carpet created with synthetic dyes will reveal that deeper fibers don't have the same color as fibers closest to the surface. Synthetic dyes usually hold their color better over time than natural dyes.  

determine if the turkish carpet is hand-knotted.  evaluate the knots per square inch (kpsi).  ask what material was used to make the turkish rug.  determine whether natural or synthetic dyes were used on the turkish carpet's fibers. 

 Do not rely on articles or videos online to teach you how to administer insulin, whether it's via a syringe, inhaler, or another device. Your doctor can answer any questions and show you the correct way to use your device (for instance, with shots she will need to show you at which angle you should insert the needle). Your doctor will also give you your exact dosage and all the necessary prescriptions.  Seek medical attention immediately if you experience an allergic reaction.   Some insulins are derived from animal sources, most commonly pork, and may cause allergic reactions in people that have severe allergies.Common allergic reactions to insulin include local and systemic reactions. Local reactions occur as redness, minor swelling, and itching at the injection site. This type of skin reaction resolves in a few days to weeks.Systemic allergic reactions can present as a rash or hives that covers large portions of the body, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, wheezing, decreased blood pressure, increased heart rate, and sweating.This is a medical emergency and you should call 911 or have someone take you to the emergency room if it is close by.  Hypoglycemia occurs when your blood sugar level is too low.Insulin will make hypoglycemia worse; instead, you will need to consumer quick-acting carbohydrates or simple sugars.   Low blood sugar interferes with your brain’s ability to function properly. Symptoms of hypoglycemia can include dizziness, trembling, headache, blurred vision, having trouble concentrating, confusion, and sometimes trouble with speaking. Other symptoms can include tremor, heavy sweating, increased heart rate, feeling anxious, and hunger.</ref> Using fast-acting insulin in the midst of a hypoglycemic event will quickly drop your blood sugar even further and result in severe confusion, inability to communicate, and loss of consciousness.If you mistakenly administer insulin when you are having a hypoglycemic event, quickly alert friends or family to seek medical attention, or call 911 if you are alone. Severe hypoglycemia events are serious and life-threatening situations.You can begin to reverse the reaction by drinking orange juice, taking prepared glucose tablets or gel, or quickly begin to consume some form of sugar., Lipodystrophy is a reaction that sometimes occurs on the skin where frequent insulin injections are given.Symptoms of lipodystrophy include changes in the fatty tissues just under the surface of the skin. Unwanted changes that indicate lipodystrophy include both thickening and thinning of the fatty tissue in the injection site areas.Check your skin regularly for lipodystrophy as well as inflammation, swelling, or any signs of infection., Never put syringes or needles in the regular trash.Sharps, including used needles, lancets, and syringes, are considered to be biohazardous waste since they came in direct contact with someone's skin or blood.Always dispose of needles that are used or damaged in a sharps container. Sharps containers are designed to be a safe way to dispose of syringes and needles.Sharps containers are available for purchase at your local pharmacy, or online.Review your state’s biohazardous waste guidelines. Many states have specific recommendations and programs that can help you develop a regular system for disposing of biohazardous waste.Work with a mail back kit. Some companies offer to supply you with the appropriate sizes of sharps containers, and agree to set up an arrangement for you to safely mail those containers back to them when they are full. The company will dispose of the biohazard materials appropriately, according to EPA, FDA, and state requirements., Once the injection has been given, discard the needle and syringe in a sharps container. When an insulin pen is empty, discard the device in the sharps container.   A needle that has pierced your skin, or the skin of someone else, is not only dulled, but contaminated with possibly serious and contagious diseases.  Some insulin products are very similar but not exact. Talk to your doctor before you make any changes in your insulin regimen, including switching brands.Even though some brands are similar, your doctor has chosen the brand that best suits your needs, and your dose has been adjusted to the way that product reacts in your body.Use the same brand of syringes and needles. It is easy to become confused and administer the wrong amount if the syringes and needles look different.  Check the expiration date on your insulin product often. Avoid using insulin that has passed its expiration date.While the potency may be close to the potency when purchased, there is a risk that you will not get enough from using products that have expired, contaminants may be present, or particles may have formed inside the vial., Once the first dose has been used from an insulin product, it is considered open.This includes insulin that has been properly stored in the refrigerator or at room temperature. Since the top of the insulin vial has been punctured, there is an increased risk of contaminants inside the vial, even if you have stored it properly., Be familiar with the brand of insulin you use, your dose, and the brand of additional supplies you use.Be sure you consistently use the same size insulin syringes and needles that were prescribed for you.Using a U-100 syringe in place of a U-500 syringe can be extremely dangerous, and vice versa. Talk to your doctor or diabetic healthcare provider if you notice any changes in your products or have any questions. 

ask your doctor for a demonstration.  avoid using any insulin product if you are allergic.  do not administer insulin if you are having a hypoglycemic event.  monitor your skin for lipodystrophy.  discard used needles properly.  never re-use or share a needle.  do not change insulin brands.  never use insulin that has expired.  discard insulin that has been open for 28 days.  know your products and your dose. 

 These are the people who will ensure that the group has proper leadership and momentum.; ,  For example, an agrarian community will likely demand a longer tenured facility than an urban trading community.  Also be prepared to address their reservations and answer their questions. Try to establish if people in the community have had any kind of relationship with a financial institution. Find out if they had borrowed before. If so, how did they repay? Did they consider it useful? Would they want to access loans of any kind - short term or long term? Knowing how they feel about loans and repayments is vital to your success.  It is important to establish the usefulness of your offering, and help them to see clearly what it is that they will get from the group's formation. , Also encourage the group members to pick a secretary who will record their meeting proceedings, and a treasurer who will keep their finances and financial records.   Encourage the group to pick a befitting name that will reflect what they do or what they want to achieve by coming together as a group The group should also pick a symbol to reflect their coming together as a group.  Encourage the group to have a few phrases to recite each meeting. For example: "We join hands to kick out poverty".   The group should agree on a particular day and time to meet regularly. The members should agree on how much to contribute at each meeting.  It is a good idea to have a financial professional and a lawyer deal with this aspect.  Explain the benefits for the members of saving an amount of money regularly. Plan to train the members on the benefits of savings and accessing credit. , 

visit the particular community and identify the community leader(s).  try to understand the basic needs of the community.  pay a courtesy visit to the community leader and explain your mission.  explain your mission to the community.  identify the women leader(s), if any.  ,  be prepared to ask the group members to pick a leader, if they have not already done so.  help set up the group's meetings.  find a micro-finance institution where the accounts of the group, as well as individual members' accounts, will be opened.  find out what it will cost to register the group.  teach the members how to keep their savings safe.  ,  explain to the group the reason why loans granted must be repaid and with interest.  

 Create three sections of hair – one in the front from ear to ear, one over your crown, and one with the rest of your hair – and tie each with a clear elastic band to form a row on top of your head. Hairspray and tease the bottom two ponytails. Wrap the middle one around the back of the bottom one, and secure it with a bobby pin. Next wrap the bottom one around the front of the now-forming bun and pin. Take out the front ponytail band, tease the hair, smooth the top layer, pull it back to the bun, pin it, and wrap the rest around the bun, securing it with a bobby pin or two tucked underneath.   Before pulling the front section back, you can use a small amount of pomade to smooth the bun, and use pins to tuck in stray pieces. Give it a good, all-over misting with a medium-hold hairspray to complete the look., Create a deep side part and use either a 1-2” barrel or triple-barrel curling iron to create waves, section-by-section, throughout your hair before letting your hair cool. Gently pull back the hair from just above your crown down to your ears and secure it with a clear elastic band into a loose ponytail just above the nape of your neck. Pull the band down so there’s space between it and your scalp and tuck the tail and the band underneath your hair, holding it in place with bobby pins.   Use a light or medium-hold hairspray and lightly spray all of your hair so curls don’t become weighed down.You can loosen the curls in the front by carefully running one or two fingers through them. For more volume in the front, finger tease the curls at the root and then set with hairspray.  Wind 1-2” sections of hair around a 2” barrel curling iron held vertically to create large curls for texture all over your head. Let them cool and then tease the hair at your crown. Take a 1-2” section of hair at both temples and pin them at the lower part of your head with bobby pins. Continue pinning back sections randomly – you’re going for loose, not stiff and tight. Curl any strands that fall out at the bottom and any long pieces in front to frame your face.   Finish with a light-hold hairspray.Make sure you apply a thermal heat protectant to your hair before brandishing the curling iron.  Tease the top of your hair, smooth it, twist it in the direction you want the twist to go, push up on it for volume, and secure it with a bobby pin. Take all the hair on the other side, pull it to middle of your head, and secure with a vertical row of crisscrossed bobby pins. Take 1-2” sections of hair from the other side, starting at the top, and smooth each over in a curved fashion to cover the bobby pins before securing each with a bobby pin hidden underneath the twist. Create a small bun from the remaining tail hair, tuck in the ends and pin it against your head.Spray hairspray on your hands or rub a dab of smoothing serum or argan oil between your palms and run them other the front and sides of your hair to smooth. Add a hair clip to the seam of the twist to glam it up or to hide areas that are a bit short and aren’t cooperating.  Curl the ends of your hair using a 1-1¼” barrel curling iron to keep them from popping out of the tuck. Then apply a very small amount of a light-hold styling cream to the ends for extra hold. Position an elastic headband 1-2” behind your hairline and pin it in place. Starting on on one side in the front and moving down, take 1-2” pieces of hair, twist them back and up, tuck them into the headband, and secure each with a bobby pin if needed. Do this all the way around your head.   Spray well with a medium-hold hairspray. You can also lightly tease and then smooth hair before twisting and tucking if yours is particularly fine.

 If you timed the planting right, the seedlings should have a set of mature leaves and be ready to transplant in time for the growing season, which starts after the last frost of the year. This falls in a different month depending on where you live. If you're unsure when the last frost might take place, ask for advice at your local nursery.  A few days before you're ready to plant the seedlings, move them to an outdoor shed or garage. Start by giving them an hour outside a day, and increase the amount of time over a week or two. This helps them get used to the outdoor climate before you place them directly in the ground. Without this extra time to acclimate, the shock of the transplant may cause them to suffer.   If you don't have a covered outdoor area, you can place the seedlings outside and construct a makeshift shelter. Leave them in the sun during the day, and cover them with a cardboard box to protect them from the wind at night. You could also match the temperature in the room where the seedlings are kept to the temperature outside.  The planting bed should be located in an area that gets the proper amount of sunlight and shade your plant needs. The soil should have the correct pH balance and composition of nutrients. Be sure that it drains well, too.   You can change the pH of the soil by adding amendments like compost or manure. If you are doing this, you should prepare the bed a week or two before planting.  Dig holes in the ground that are roughly the size of your seedling containers. Make sure the holes are spaced far enough apart so that the plants have plenty of room to grow. Carefully lift the seedlings from their containers, gently separate the root balls a bit, and plant them in the holes.  As they grow, continue providing the correct conditions for the plants to grow healthy.  

plan to transplant after the last frost.  move the seedling container to a covered outdoor area.  prepare the planting bed according to the plant's needs.  plant the seedlings in the ground.  water and fertilize the seedlings. 

 Figure out what being interesting means to you. What’s interesting won’t be the same to everybody and for everybody. Knowing what you are interested in is essential to becoming more adept at interacting with others in a way that might be seen as more interesting. Hone your skills by learning about what you are good at. This is a much easier approach instead of trying to force yourself to learn more about something that you don’t have any interest in.Think about qualities and activities that are fascinating to you. What do you think is interesting, either about yourself or about other people? It is also much easier to converse about topics that you already have some interest in, as opposed to simply acting interested in others’ lives simply to make them happy.; , Determining what is “interesting” – and how you can attain this quality – will probably depend on your own unique skill set as well as the group of people you enjoy being around the most. If you consider yourself a pretty good musician, for example, and enjoy hanging around musically inclined people, then being interesting will likely involve a working knowledge of music and how to play an instrument. On the other hand, such elements might not be so important to being an interesting person if you are someone who’s primarily interested in sports or cars.   This doesn’t mean that you should completely tailor your conversations for other people. If you’re not interested in what you’re saying, then you’re not going to be as interesting. Strive to be genuine while being interesting.  Recognize that you are already an interesting person. You may become a more interesting person for other people when you highlight some of your unique qualities.   This might sound paradoxical at first, but it really just means that striving to be yourself is the best way to appear most comfortable. This in turn will make others more comfortable around you.  Experiment with new activities that might interest you. When you stretch your comfort zone, you get yourself out of a rut. You inject more excitement in your life. You meet new people. Be open to trying new activities so that you learn to be a little more fearless.Try volunteering at a nonprofit organization, or learning a new sport or hobby. Pick something that you have very little experience with and go for it!  , Your goal to become more interesting might involve becoming more courageous or being friendlier. But it's difficult to achieve these traits unless you have a specific plan in place. Try out concrete activities or skills, instead of focusing on building one of your personality traits.   For example, instead of convincing yourself you need to be more courageous, you might try simply participating in an activity that produces some degree of fear when you think about it. Or, you could try rock climbing if you are afraid of heights, or visit a petting zoo if you are afraid of animals. By pushing yourself out of your comfort zone, you might eventually become more comfortable with participating in activities you or others might find interesting.  When you expand your network of acquaintances, you can become exposed to more interesting situations and activities. Ask people questions about themselves.   Once you get someone talking, you may discover, for example, that this person has expert knowledge of beekeeping, an activity you've always wanted to try.  Seeing more of the world can make you more attuned to subtle differences between people from different backgrounds or different ethnicities. Being sensitive to how these differences affect others and yourself can sometimes make people feel more comfortable around you.   This will also give you a greater sense for what interesting can look like in different parts of the world. Make your next holiday an unusual one. Go to an exotic place and do things you would not normally do. This might include an activity such as backpacking, surfing, climbing a mountain or going on a jungle safari.  Read books about fun topics such as how to make unique cocktails, exotic places to travel or how to become a great lover. These topics will give you lots of material for riveting conversations.  It’s important to learn how to engage with others even when you’re not interested in the topic that’s being discussed. Conversation is like a back and forth negotiation with another person. The conversation can go in any direction. Remaining open to this process is important for becoming a more interesting person. Ask questions to show that you are interested. This also opens up the conversation to give you more material, which helps you figure out more questions to ask.   For example, if you find out that a person is an expert beekeeper, you could ask, "I've always wanted to get into beekeeping. How does a person get started doing that?" You're allowing the other person to share his expertise with others, something most people are thrilled to do. If you're talking with someone about her job, you might ask, "Did you always want to be a journalist?" Or you might ask, "Which journalist do you admire most?", Find people who have skills and interests that you admire. Prioritize the time you spend with them. Remember that who you spend time with greatly affects how your personality and interests develop.Spheres of social influence, from your local community to your country, can affect you in overt and subtle ways. Watching others who are interesting can be a great way to get you started in the right direction.  Research has found that even if you aren’t necessarily happy to begin with, the mere act of smiling can release chemicals in your brain that make you more comfortable in your surroundings. As a result, your smile conveys this feeling to others. Smiling and laughter has even been shown to relieve symptoms of minor depression and anxiety.If you want to be a more interesting person, therefore, but can’t seem to get started on the right path, simply smiling more often and putting yourself in situations that make you laugh can be a great place to start.  Everyone has their own interests and manners of acting in the world. It will be impossible to make yourself seem interesting to everyone. Be happy with who you truly are. Accept that not everyone will find you interesting, or even necessarily like you. This can in turn make you more interesting to the people who actually respect your unique sense of self.   Give this person the benefit of the doubt. Say to yourself, "This person is probably having a bad day." Then say something nice to the person. This might jar him enough to recognize that he's being rude. You could try exaggerating the insult, which also functions to make a mockery of the insult. If someone says, "I've seen lots of people learn to ski more quickly than you," you might say, "I've only just learned how to walk upright, so I guess I'm going at a good pace.", While being interesting can mean talking about yourself, it also means that you show interest in other people. Ask about the person’s children, or ask for details about his recent vacation. Make the other person comfortable in your presence by making yourself easy to talk to., Don’t let a conversation die out by failing to show adequate interest. Keep a conversation going by continuing to ask questions. This shows that you are listening and are invested in what the other person has to say.Ask open-ended questions in the conversation. These types of questions encourage the other person to talk at length, rather than give a yes-or-no answer to your question.  A person is interesting often because he is interesting to listen to. No matter the subject, he can tell a good story. He relates funny details, engages the audience, and stays focused on the topic at hand.   A great story that you're telling to someone else has certain elements just like books or movies. A great story has compelling characters, relevant details, a conflict, a turning point, and even a surprising ending.Even if the story is short, think about how you can structure the story to be fascinating to the listener.  Oftentimes, you can be an interesting person simply by allowing those around you to say what’s on their mind without interrupting or imposing any sort of moral judgment. While this might sound easy, it can actually be a particularly difficult thing. This is especially true if you’re used to saying exactly what’s on your mind without pause for concern. Active listening means that you are following along actively with what another person is saying without forcing your own ideas and thought into the conversation.Active listening also means that you remain attentive to what’s being conveyed without necessarily trying to think forward towards what you want to say next. Next time somebody is trying to tell you a story, try simply letting them speak for as long as they feel compelled to do so, all the while allowing yourself to be affected by what they are saying. Watch for changes in facial expression or tone of voice. Good listening requires paying attention to non-verbal features just as much as what’s said.People typically like being around others who give them a chance to speak what’s on their mind.  Hold your body in a confident manner. Straighten your shoulders and hold your head high. You might even try being more expressive with your hands, instead of jamming them in your pockets.   When you are talking with someone, convey your full attention with confident body language. This means that your body faces him or her, and you make eye contact.If you are in a room with a lot of distractions, try your best to focus on this other person.  

write down a list of your skills and interests.  think about what “interesting” might mean to other people.  embrace your uniqueness.  try out new activities to stretch your comfort zone.  build your personality traits by trying out concrete activities.  meet new people.  travel as much as possible.  read more.  learn to engage with others about their interests.  hang out with people who you find interesting.  smile and laugh as often as you can.  learn to shake off insults or disrespect from other people.  get a sense of what people want to hear about.  ask questions.  learn how to be a good storyteller.  become an active listener.  use confident body language. 

 Helping your friend with bipolar disorder will require that the two of you communicate honestly and openly. Dealing with emotional disorders can be just as trying for friendships as it is for each individual.Let your friend know when you’re worried about them by telling them so. Speak to your friend in private and say something like, “I’ve noticed that you have been acting differently lately, is there anything going on?” You may also want to identify behaviors your find troubling like, “when you don’t take my calls for a few days I start to worry, is everything okay?” It’s okay to get on each other’s nerves, but make it clear to your friend that you care about him or her. Express your feelings and concerns in a caring way.; , Bipolar disorder can be difficult to manage, and sometimes the emotional difficulties of the condition may drive your friend to seek some time alone. Respect your friend’s need to be alone sometimes so they can decompress.Everyone needs some time to themselves occasionally. Your friend may be tired of trying to manage their feelings around people and simply need to relax. If you are worried that your friend may hurt themselves, don’t leave them alone.  Sometimes your friend may just need a sympathetic ear. Listen to what your friend has to say without judging them or the situation. Don’t simply offer up solutions to every issue that arises either.Sometimes your friend may just need someone they can vent to without having to workshop possible solutions to what’s bothering them. Simply listening can help validate your friend’s feelings and help them feel more in control and understood.  If your friend’s bipolar disorder is going untreated, you may want to keep an eye out for warning signs that your friend’s condition may make them a danger to themselves or others. Even if your friend is undergoing treatment, you should still be aware of signs that your friend’s condition is worsening.If your friend starts experiencing issues with sleep, increased activity and irritability, they may be beginning to relapse, or their condition may be worsening. If your friend begins sleeping much more or is lethargic, they may be experiencing depression instead of a manic episode, and still may need to seek help.  Having bipolar disorder is often a burden people carry for their entire lives. During that time, they are often exposed to clichéd suggestions or pieces of advice. Avoid falling into that same trap.Giving common and generalized recommendations like, “just look for the silver lining” or “cheer up” is ineffective and may do the opposite of helping your friend feel better. Using “canned” responses to your friend’s real problems can make him or her feel increasingly isolated and alone because they don’t have someone that understands what they’re going through. Instead of using canned responses, try saying something like, “I know this is hard on you, but you’re doing really well,” or, “I’ve never experienced something like that, can you tell me how it makes you feel?”  , Remember that when someone with bipolar disorder experiences a manic episode, they may believe things that aren’t true, say things that they don’t mean or become increasingly aggressive.You may want to help your friend negotiate a treatment contract while he or she is doing well. A treatment contract gives you the power to take steps to protect your friend if they need it like contacting their doctor or helping them check in for treatment. Create a plan ahead of time for what you will do if your friend is going through a manic episode that requires your intervention.  Bipolar disorder does not only require management when experiencing emotional lows. The onset of manic episodes can often include being extremely outgoing, cheerful and enthusiastic. Keep an eye out for destructive behavior that seems driven by positivity.It is not uncommon for someone experiencing a manic episode to spend significant sums of money, including money they do not have. Drinking and drugs can worsen the situation for people suffering bipolar disorder, even if they seem like they’re just trying to “have a good time.”  , Suicide can be a significant risk for those suffering from bipolar disorder, so always take warning signs that your friend may be considering suicide seriously. Your actions could save your friend’s life.Learn to identify the warning signs that your friend may be considering suicide. Some common warning signs are increasing alcohol or drug use, acting withdrawn, or talking about a sense of hopelessness. If your friend seems to lose interest in things that used to interest them, that may also indicate that they are considering suicide. If you think your friend may be considering suicide, find them help and don’t leave your friend alone.  If your friend has children or is responsible for someone’s care, you should make a plan to keep them safe and cared for in the event of your friend experiencing a manic episode.Plan for children to stay with someone else while your friend works through the most difficult stages of a manic episode. Make sure children understand the nature of the situation and that your friend loves them. Clarify that the situation is not the children’s fault to ensure they don’t feel as though they caused an adverse situation to arise.  Suffering from bipolar disorder can be extremely frustrating, and the nature of the illness can make managing those feelings difficult at times. The first step to helping a friend with bipolar disorder is to be patient with them.If your friend is undergoing treatment, it may take time for it to make a difference. Being patient can help your friend maintain their own patience for the process to work. If your friend is not seeking treatment, be patient with them as you encourage them to do so. Losing your patience will only make the situation worse, instead of better.  Bipolar disorder is a real medical condition that requires treatment in order to be managed effectively. If your friend does not want to seek medical treatment for their disorder, encourage them to reconsider.Acknowledging that bipolar disorder is not anyone’s fault and is indeed an illness is a good step toward seeking medical treatment. Bipolar disorder can get worse if left untreated. If you aren’t sure how to bring it up in conversation, take your friend aside and in private and say something like, “I know you’ve been having a hard time. Have you thought about seeing if a doctor could help?”  , Having bipolar disorder creates limitations your friend must live with, and in order to effectively help them it’s important that you understand and respect them as well. A person suffering from bipolar disorder cannot simply “snap out of it” when experiencing a low stage or a manic episode.A person with bipolar disorder cannot always control their emotions or the way those emotions make them act. Suggesting that a person stop feeling a certain way or that they should “look on the bright side” will not help someone with bipolar disorder.  You must treat yourself with the same level of respect and understanding that you provide your friend. That means understanding and respecting your own limitations as well as those of your friend.It’s okay to get frustrated at times, but try not to take those frustrations out on your friend. Instead, take a time out and separate yourself from the situation. Don’t expect too much from yourself. You are there to help your friend, but ultimately your friend will need to make the hard decisions for his or herself.  It may help if you develop a better understanding of bipolar disorder and what it entails. This may help you to deal with situations as they arise as well as providing you a means by which to empathize with your friend.Do research online to learn more about bipolar disorder at websites like BBRFoundation.org. If your friend has not been diagnosed, learn how to identify the symptoms of bipolar disorder. Remember that each person suffers from bipolar disorder in a different way, so if your friend does not exhibit symptoms exactly as you’ve researched, that may just be a part of their situation.  

speak openly to each other.  respect your friend’s need for time alone.  listen without passing judgement or trying to solve problems.  identify when your friend needs help.  avoid clichéd platitudes.  make a plan for the bad times.  be aware of potential problems in the good times.  learn the warning signs of suicidal ideations.  make a plan for children or loved ones.  be patient.  encourage your friend to seek treatment.  accept your friend’s limits.  acknowledge your own limits.  educate yourself about bipolar disorder. 

 Why are you opening a bank? Are there local community banks in your area? Any business will only succeed if there is a market. People in the area need the product you are trying to sell them.; , Typically, this is five to thirteen people. The board of directors oversees the strategic plan of the bank, and makes sure employees at all levels comply with company policies and federal regulations.Board members should not be directly involved with the bank, and a few should have previous banking experience. Appoint a few members over the regulation level in case someone drops out for any reason.  This amount can run anywhere from 12 to 20 million dollars.This money can come from various places. If your board of directors are community business owners, they might be willing to invest the money. Other sources of capital include private equity funds, founders groups, a bank holding company, supporting financial institutions, and special funding available for community banks.Starting capital ensures all the banks operations and gives the bank a certain amount of collateral. Capital guidelines are found through the primary regulator, either Federal Reserve, FDIC, or OCC., A financial projection is required during the charter application process. This may require a three to five year business plan and projection.   You need to demonstrate that a new bank would profit. Showing the plans for growth shows investors what they can expect as a return on their investment (ROI). Before you can open a bank, you have to prove you've done research into your competitor's businesses and that you can either come up with a comparable product or somehow provide a beneficial service no one else has thought up yet.  Opening a bank can be a very arduous and confusing process with many legal regulations that must be followed and applications that must be filed. Hiring someone familiar with this process can expedite your preparations and help you cover all your bases.  This must be done before the bank is opened. A risk management structure "identifies, measures, monitors, and controls the risks involved in an institution's various products and lines. These risks include, but are not limited to, credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal, and reputational risk."Hire the best people who know how to assess for risk and keep policy and procedures in place that keep your employees aware of the next scheme, fraud, or bad decision.  A community reinvestment specialist responds when your bank is called to show how the bank is contributing to the community. They must be knowledgeable of the rules and regulations in place and be able to respond appropriately to concerns for the bank. They must also report in their meetings with you the ways in which the bank would be appropriately steered toward investment efforts.  These include both federal and state legal charters. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency grants federal documents. You can find a list and instructions on the OCC website. The state can issue the state charter.   A bank must also be approved for deposit insurance by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation., Now that you have completed all the initial steps and gotten your bank approved, you need to find a suitable place. It's of vital important for you to familiarize yourself with all potential customers and competitors around you.  Find a place with smooth traffic. Choose a position with a great deal of markets and residential buildings. Seek out a location with other competitive bank as little as possible.  Since you have found a appropriate place, you need a place to establish your bank. Make sure there is enough room for:   At least three personal banker offices A seating area An inside teller area A drive-thru teller A vault. This can be accessible to both the tellers and deposit box customers, or the bank can house separate vaults. The vault needs to be far into the bank, not near the door. An internal and an external ATM A security guard station        , An elevator speech is a less than 30-seconds pitch that just rolls off your tongue. When someone asks you what you do, you should be able to recite this from memory, with feeling and gusto, and convince them they need this product too. You are going to have to spread the word about your bank.  Work with money transportation specialty companies, such as armored car services, as well as any governing bodies, such as regulators.  Doing an analysis of your community and its demographics can help you determine what services the bank should offer. If you are striving for a community bank approach, offer:   Checking Savings Mortgage Loans Small Business Loans Investment and Planning CDs and other short/long-term savings methods       If you are striving for a larger industrial bank, to the above options you will add: Private wealth and investment management Commercial loans - small (less than $1 Million), mid (between $1 Million and $5 Million) and large Targets (above $5 Million in revenue) Commercial DDAs International Banking        , Always have between 10-20% of your overall money held in reserve, as a protection for the worst events.  Growing the money means spending the money. Your bank customers depend upon you to know when to apply the money to a construction loan for a new hospital and when to put the money into a growing investment. Risk is always a factor, but knowing what is an acceptable risk is part of the game.  Many people do their banking online, so an online banking system is necessary for running a successful bank.  For many banks starting out, reputation and word of mouth is pivotal in their survival. Having competent bankers with strong financial and banking backgrounds gives the customers confidence when placing their money. Placing friendly tellers with excellent customer service skills leaves a lasting impression on the customers, making them want to return.  

determine a need.  appoint a board of directors.  make sure you have the starting capital.  create a business summary plan.  hire a legal team.  establish a risk management infrastructure.  hire a public face.  apply for all charters.  find a place.  purchase the space.  come up with an elevator speech.  establish the appropriate relationships.  establish the what the bank will offer.  monitor your cashflow.  invest in your community.  establish an online banking option.  hire excellent employees. 

 It's much easier to juice a zested lemon than it is to zest a juiced lemon. Here are some ways to do this:   The first way is to use a lemon zester. This is a handy tool, built with the express purpose of peeling the skin off lemons and limes. Another way to do this is with a fine-toothed grater. The advantage to this is that rather than having long strips of skin to then chop fine, the grater does all that in the process of grating. A third method is paring. With a paring knife or vegetable peeler, peel away strips of lemon skin. If you use a peeler, make sure you trim off any of the white pith before proceeding—it's very bitter. Mince the lemon zest, until you have 1 tablespoon of lemon zest—about 1 lemon.; , A regular hand juicer should get you about 2 tablespoons of juice from one lemon. If you find you're not getting enough juice, try rolling the lemon firmly on a hard surface to break up the tissue and release more juice, or microwave it for 10 seconds to warm it up.  Combine the Whisk eggs, sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest in a small saucepan, and whisk together until well-blended.  Stir in the butter with a spoon, and mix until smooth.  Do not bring to a boil. Over low heat, gently bring the mixture barely to a simmer (small bubbles occasionally rising to the surface). Cook, stirring constantly, for about 15 minutes or until the mixture thickens.  Pour into small glass jars, custard cups, or small bowls, and store in the refrigerator.  

zest the lemons.  juice the lemons.  beat the eggs.  add butter.  bring the mixture to a simmer.  let cool slightly. 

 For best results, you should use a soap that’s potent enough to kill whatever bacteria happens to be lingering within the brush. Apply the soap directly to the brush head and let it seep in.Antibacterial hand soap or mild liquid dish detergent can be readily found in most homes and will typically be strong enough to get the job done. Some dermatologists also recommend using a sulfate shampoo, as it contains compounds that are formulated to cut through oil, dead skin cells and other gunk., Use your fingers to work the soap into a thick lather. Make sure the soap is able to penetrate down to the base of the bristles. Continue scrubbing the brush head until it’s clear of all visible dirt and discoloration.Rubbing the bristles along the palm of your hand while you scrub will create more friction to remove caked-on residue. Reapply more soap as needed until you’re satisfied with the look of the bristles. Get in the habit of cleaning your Clarisonic brush after every couple uses., Flush the area where the brush head connects with the handle with soapy water, then rinse. Dip a cotton swab in rubbing alcohol and use it to go over the deep recesses that you can’t reach by hand. Pay special attention to spots where makeup and other substances appear to have settled.An old toothbrush may also be useful for getting down into cracks and crevices., Run the brush head, connector piece and handle under the faucet until the water runs clear. When you’re finished, the Clarisonic should look as good as new!Shake off excess water to prevent hard water deposits from forming on the bristles. You may not be able to rid your Clarisonic of all discoloration. Don’t worry—the bristle will still be clean, and mild staining won’t affect the brush’s performance., Set the individual pieces aside on a clean, dry towel. When they’ve had a chance to dry, you can put the brush back together and resume regular use.To speed things along, turn on the ventilation fan in your bathroom to get more air circulating through the room. Don’t attempt to use other means, such as a hair dryer, to accelerate the drying process. This may cause damage to the delicate mechanisms that power the unit.  

squirt a few drops of antibacterial soap into the bristles of the brush.  scrub the brush head gently.  detail the inner workings of the brush with alcohol.  rinse each component thoroughly with hot water.  allow the brush to air dry. 

 This is a golden rule. Camellias do best in light shade that protects them from hot afternoon sun.This doesn't mean that they need total shade, just enough so that they don't bake in the sun.   As a camellia grows, it can tolerate more sun. This is because a mature camellia will have a big canopy of leaves that will shade the roots and make sure they don't get too dried out by the sun. This also depends on what climate you are planting the camellia in. If you are in a climate that never gets very hot, then a camellia can cope with a spot with less shade.; , The more sheltered the camellia, the better the flowering will be. This is because the dehydration from winds any time of year can kill camellias, whether it be warm winds in the summer or cold winds in the winter.Try planting your camellia between 3 to 6 feet from your house. This will give it good protection from the wind. If you need to, erect a fence or trellis to divert direct wind away from your camellia plants. The lighter the flower color, the more protection from wind is needed.  Dig a hole that is two feet wider than the root ball of the plant. The hole should be just a bit deeper than the root ball in the center but a few inches deeper than than that around the edges. Keeping the hole shallow in the center will prevent the plant from sinking.Digging the hole deeper around the edges will give the plant's roots some looser soil to easily spread out into.   Place the rootball in the hole, making sure the top is slightly above the soil level. Fill the rest of the hole with a mixture of top soil and organic material. Press the dirt around the plant down so that it is firmly in place. Then give the plant a deep watering. If the weather is dry, give a new plant a thorough watering every week until it is well established.  Camellias love deep watering about twice weekly, rather than daily shallow watering. This is partially because camellias love generally moist soil as opposed to soggy soil. Giving a deep soak allows the soil to have a generally moist consistency for longer.  Mulching will help keep moisture in the ground and it will keep the soil cooler on hot summer days. In addition, mulch will help keep weeds at bay.Use whatever mulch you have readily available but don't pile it more than a few inches high, no matter what you use. This can keep soil too wet and lead to root rot. Remember that the mulch should not touch the trunk of the plant.Mulch also adds new organic material to your soil. This will help to break up clay soil or add richness to sandy soil. In general, it will increase the quality of your top soil tremendously.  Some Camellias are considered heavy eaters, meaning that they need a lot of nutrients from the soil in order to thrive. This will ensure lush growth and good flowering each season.   There are other varieties too, where the plant is not a heavy feeder, and do not react well to over-stimulation.Interestingly their bloom time is also their dormant period and should not be fertilized then.Cottonseed meal and fish emulsion are good natural choices. Two or three feedings between April 1 and September 1 is all that is necessary.Contact your local extension service or camellia experts to get recommendations of fertilizers that work well in your specific area and for your specific variety of the plant. Fertilizers usually have three numbers on them, which tells you about the nutrients in it. The first number is for nitrogen, the second number is for phosphorus, and the third number is for potassium.If you want your camellia to increase in size because it is newly planted, give it a fertilizer with a larger first number, such as 10 or 12. If you just want to maintain the size of an already established plant, then a lower first number, such as 4, will work well.  There is a common perception that camellias are acid loving. The reality is that camellias prefer slightly acidic conditions but they do not like very acidic conditions. If you've been overdoing the acidic fertilising, stop now!   If you test your soil, it should have a ph between 5.5 and 6.8 to make a camellia happy.If you notice the leaves turning yellow, the camellia likely needs more acid in the soil. Re-pot with fresh potting soil formulated for acid-loving plants.,   Check the top and the underside of the leaves weekly for aphids and spider mites. When you spot an infestation, rinse off the insects with a strong stream of water. Check the woody stems for scale insects. Scale appears as raised welts that scrape off easily. Spray scale with a ready-mixed all-season horticultural oil., If you prune right after blooming then you will give the plant time to rejuvenate and grow new buds for the following spring. There is a good period of dormant time between when the plant blooms and when it starts to sprout new growth for you to do this.Pruning at other times of year will not kill a well-established plant. However, it will eliminate your buds for the following spring, so prune off season carefully.  Pruning reinvigorates the plant and decreases the chances of bug or disease infestations.   To avoid the chance of disease entering the plant, cut branches flush to feeder branches, instead of leaving nubs., To begin with, remove leggy or lanky branches that stick out and don't look good. Then prune for general shape. Pruning should also be done to shape the plant so it fits into your landscape. This may mean a light or severe pruning, depending on the shape of the camellia and how long it has been left to grown untended.   Severe pruning means removing one third to one half of the plant. This should be done without fear of losing the plant, as most camellias are very strong and will outlive those that planted them. However, the year following a severe pruning you will probably have fewer blooms, as the plant it focused on regrowing its branches and leaves.Light pruning can be done with small hand shears or larger shaping shears. You will get a cleaner look if you prune individual branches, as opposed to cutting large swaths with shaping shears.  

plant in light shade.  keep camellias out of the path of wind.  planting the camellia.  use deep watering.  mulch around your camellia.  apply a suitable fertilizer every spring.  don't overdo the acid.  look for infestations.  prune right after blooming.  remove dead and dying growth.this will improve the overall health of the plant.  shape bushes to your liking. 

 Pour a small amount of coconut oil into your hand. Rub the substance onto your skin gently, right over the glitter, using circular motions. The sparkly bits will loosen and dislodge. Soak a large cotton ball with water and run it over the same area of skin. This will remove the oil and get rid of any remaining pieces of glitter on your skin., Hop into the shower and pour a liberal amount of high quality olive oil into your hands. Massage the oil into your hair, taking care to work it all the way down to the scalp. Leave the oil on your hair for at least ten minutes, then rinse it out thoroughly. The glitter will wash away with the oil and your hair will feel silky smooth.If you have oily hair, apply your regular shampoo, work it into a lather, and then rinse the oil and shampoo from your hair thoroughly.  If you’ve dropped glitter onto your carpet, get out your vacuum cleaner and use the hose attachment to suck up as much of it as possible. Do not use the attachment with the brush on the end, or the glitter will become embedded in the bristles and spread around your home.   Follow up with strips of tape to get the stubborn pieces out of the carpet.  Get as much of the glitter up as you can by using your broom. Be sure to rinse your broom bristles out later – otherwise, the glitter will spread. Then soak a cloth with water and wipe down the flooring. The glitter should stick to the cloth. Run it under the tap to rinse the glitter off, then continue wiping the floor down until you’ve removed all of the glitter.You can use the tape method for any stubborn pieces of glitter that remain. Use a cloth for this – don’t use your mop. The glitter will embed itself into the mop fibers and can be difficult to remove.  

use coconut oil to remove glitter from your face and skin.  use olive oil to remove glitter from your hair.  vacuum your carpet with a hose attachment.  use a wet cloth on tile and hardwood flooring. 

 Run down to your local pharmacy and pick up a pack of dissolving denture cleaning tablets. Most denture tablets contain sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) as an active ingredient, which fizzes when the tablets are added to water. They are designed to eliminate stains from artificial teeth as they soak, which means they’re perfectly safe to use for objects that you’ll be putting in or around your mouth.A pack of denture tablets will only run you a few dollars, providing many uses in cleaning your well-used flask. The dissolving action of denture tablets also has an antibacterial effect, sterilizing the flask as they clean., Fill your empty flask to about the halfway point with warm or hot water. The higher the temperature of the water, the faster it will begin to loosen the hold of troublesome stains. Allow the flask to soak for a few minutes before moving on to the next step.Swish the water around inside the flask to make sure it’s completely wet throughout. This will help the sodium bicarbonate react on all parts of the flask’s inner surface.  Drop a couple of denture tablets into your water-filled flask. The chemical reaction will cause the water to bubble and foam up, so it’s best to do this in the sink, outside or somewhere you don’t have to worry about making a mess. Don’t cap the flask—this will cause pressure to build up inside.A good general guideline is to use one tablet for every two cups of the flask’s volume.  Walk away from the flask while the tablets do their thing. As they dissolve, the effervescent action will also disintegrate the buildup on the walls of the flask. Allow the flask to sit for up to half an hour, until the effect of the tablets has begun to diminish.Denture cleaning tablets are one of the safest and most effective ways to clean a dirty flask or thermos. All you have to do is wait. Once the reaction has died down, you can go over the inside of the flask with a bottle brush for a more thorough clean.  Pour out the water that the denture tablets dissolved in. Run fresh water in and out of the flask a few times to clear away whatever traces are left behind. While the flask is drying, keep it right-side up with the cap off. Afterwards, it will look as good as new!Putting the cap on your flask while it’s still wet will encourage bacteria to set up shop inside. 

buy a package of denture cleaning tablets.  fill your flask with water.  add one or two denture cleaning tablets.  let the flask sit for awhile.  rinse repeatedly. 

 Roughly 20 to 30 minutes of rapid walking can aid in the digestive process. Walking quickly will help relieve bloating better than a slow walk.Walking is gentle enough to prevent further stomach upset, but it also provides enough physical activity to keep food and trapped air moving through the digestive tract. The increased heart rate and breathing causes the digestive muscles to push air and food through the intestines.; , Bloating can come with a host of other uncomfortable feelings. Heat can reduce the pain from bloating, and it can help relax you, which can relieve the gas or constipation causing the bloating.There are many ways you can apply heat:   Place a heating pad on your stomach for direct heat. Take a hot bath or shower. Relax in a sauna.  For five minutes, gently apply pressure in a small circular motion to a spot roughly four finger-widths above your belly button. This technique is known as acupressure. Putting gentle pressure on your abdomen can ease physical stress on the stomach, reducing any present tension and bloating. If your bloating is caused by constipation, it can also help encourage going to the bathroom., Lay down on your back in a dark room. Read a book. Meditate. Relaxation can help relieve the symptoms of chronic bloating. If you are frequently stressed and you suffer from bloating, try taking some time out of your day to peacefully rest.Your body will be relaxed enough to either pass the gas or constipation that is causing your bloating.  

take a walk when you are bloated.  apply heat.  apply pressure to your stomach.  relax your body.

 Since you will not be able to try the shoes on before buying, it is important to know the exact size of your foot. Look at the size of the shoe which currently fits you well.   You should also be aware of any foot problems or conditions you have, such as flat feet. If you want to be very precise with your foot size, buy a Brannock foot measurer online. This is the tool that stores use in order to measure the length and width of your foot. Buying this device will help ensure you are buying the correct size.; , Are you looking for comfort, style, or a mix of both? These are important considerations to make before you decide on any shoe to buy. Determining the type of shoe will also help you narrow in on proper search terms.   Shopping for style is slightly harder online since you can't see how they actually look on you.Buying shoes for comfort is generally easier to do online.  For example, if you are looking for high heels, search "high heels" in the search field of whatever service you are using.   You may also wish to add the size in your search term, but many websites will allow you to select a size. If you know of a particular company that you want to buy from, add the name of the company to the search term. If you have a certain color or design in mind, also add these words to your search term.    Amazon may be the most helpful in finding these reviews, even if you do not intend to buy the shoes from Amazon. If you have any foot condition, be sure to look for reviews mentioning problems the shoe may have with the condition. Determine the correct size for the shoe. Sizing is not uniform across all companies, so you will need to figure out which size is right for the particular company. Many online stores will have a chart, but reading customer reviews will also help with this task.  Certain online stores will have sales or offer the shoes at lower prices. Spend some time scouring through different search results before making your final purchase decision.   There are also websites which help you with this process. Look up "compare shoe prices" in your favorite search engine to find these websites. Avoid sites like eBay or Craigslist when buying shoes since they will likely be used or have problems.  If you have flat feet, for instance, ask the company how the shoe can support your condition.   Be wary of any company which refuses to respond to questions or is dismissive of you. When buying shoes online, you want a company which will be responsive to concerns.  Be sure whatever service you are using is safe and secure before entering credit card information. You can also use services like PayPal if you are unsure about the website.   Be sure the service accepts returns. There is a high chance that the shoe will not fit exactly right once it actually comes. No matter how much thought goes into the purchase, you will never know until you try it on.  

be sure you know exactly the size of your foot.  determine what kind of shoe you want to buy.  enter what you are searching for into google, amazon, or your favorite search engine/shopping website.  once you have found a shoe which appeals to you, look up the exact name of the shoe and read customer reviews.customer reviews will be very useful, and something you do not necessarily get when shopping for shoes physically.  compare prices for the same shoe from multiple websites.  if you have any concerns with the shoe, feel free to call or e-mail the company with questions.  once you feel confident with your shoe choice, buy the shoe. 

 Your audience needs to know that your character is a vampire. You can state it outright, or, if you want to be more subtle, give clues so your reader (and maybe your characters) can discover the vampire. If you want to build some mystery and suspense (always a good idea with vampires), it is better to show the character is a vampire rather than stating outright.Feel free to ignore certain rules. To make your work stand out, you can ignore or modify certain character traits of the vampire. Unpredictability can be a good thing in fiction. Just make sure you explain these to your audience at some point.If killing the vampire is integral to the story, there must be a way of killing it. If the vampire is the hero, and can't die, then there is little suspense. If the vampire is the villain, then you have given your heroes an impossible task, and the story will only end in failure.; , Your character may not need to kill the vampire right away, especially if he is the main villain. You will want your hero to be able to keep the vampire away while he looks for what is necessary to kill it. Some of these actions include:Holding holy objects, like a cross or Bible. Vampires are evil creatures, so the generally reject sacred items. Similarly, vampires resist sacred places, so churches and other religious buildings can be safe spaces. These do not have to be exclusively Christian, so symbols from Judaism, Islam, and other faiths can work. It is important to remember that the symbol itself is not as important as the faith of the person using it. Spreading small grainy items like salt or sand. Traditionally, vampires will obsessively count objects they come across, so something small that you can drop in large amounts can delay your foe. Fine grains like oats or rice will also work. Similar to fine grains, vampires may also count the knots in a fishing net. Hanging one over doors and windows will buy some time if a vampire tries to enter. Having certain plants. Vampires resist plants that generally symbolize new life, such as roses, holly, or hawthorn. Other traditions use plants such as buckthorn, juniper logs, blackthorn, or rowan. Your character can have these around the home, or carry them around.  One good way to kill a vampire (or any other creature) is by cutting off its head. In some genres, the mouth is then stuffed with garlic to prevent the vampire from coming back., There are certain objects, like bullets or wooden stakes, that can be driven into a vampire's heart or chest, that will kill it.Wooden stake. There can be something special about the wood (from a particular tree, or shaped into a holy object like a cross), or it can just be a sharp piece of wood. Some vampire stories in modern day settings use everyday wooden objects like pool cues and coat racks.Like some of the wooden stakes, in many cases there is something special about particular bullets that will kill vampires. They can be silver bullets (as with werewolves), or blessed by a priest to be sacred objects.  Vampires are evil creatures, and may not react well to sacred objects. Spraying them with sacred water can scald or burn vampires. You'll have to decide if the vampire need to be doused in it, or just a splash will do., In some traditions, vampires need to avoid the daylight, or else they will turn into dust. In other works, vampires move around in broad daylight without any problems.If you decide to make sunlight fatal, remember that most of your action with the vampire will need to take place at night or in dark areas.  The characters killing the vampire need to be able to accomplish the task, so they need a way to acquire necessary items. If they need holy objects, your characters may need access to a church or priest. If their weapons require a certain type of wood, those trees should grow in your setting.  

identify the vampire.  ward the vampire off.  decapitate the vampire.  attack it with other objects.  spray the vampire with holy water.  bring the vampire into sunlight.  equip your hero with the appropriate tools. 

 It is important to start with a clean slate. Wash your face with a gentle cleanser and then follow with a lightweight moisturizer. If you will be spending time out in the sun, then use a moisturizer that contains sunscreen.You can also try a primer. Primers can help to even out your skin and make your foundation look better after you put it on. Try using a matte primer if you want a shine-free look. Just apply the primer to your whole face before you apply your foundation. Using a special serum, such as an eye cream or fine line serum, can also be helpful.Try choosing a special serum that targets an area that tends to give you trouble.; , If you have dark circles under your eyes, then apply a few vertical steaks of concealer over them and then blend them well.Your concealer should be a shade or two lighter than your foundation and using one that has a yellow tone to it will also help to cover dark circles better.         You can use a concealer brush or use a concealer that comes in stick form. Don’t worry if it looks really bright. You can blend and even out the color when you apply your foundation.  Next, apply foundation to your entire face to give yourself even coverage. Make sure that you blend you foundation evenly, especially around your hairline and in the creases around your nose and chin.         You can also use special tools to make blending your foundation easier, such as a blending sponge, a foundation brush, or a buffing brush.Make sure that you choose a foundation that suits your needs. Foundation is available in light coverage formulas and full coverage formulas. You can also get foundation that is moisturizing, matte finish, or oil-free., After you have finished applying your foundation, you might notice a few pimples that are still visible through the makeup. In this case, you can apply a little extra concealer to cover these pimples.         Pat on the concealer with a small makeup brush and then use one of your blending tools to blend the makeup in. If you want, you can also blend a few different concealer or foundation colors to create a custom color.  If you want some bronze highlights, then you can apply a few strategic streaks of a darker color foundation. Choose a foundation that is a few shades darker than your foundation and apply streaks down the sides of your nose, the hollow areas of your cheeks, and just above your eyebrows.         Use one of your blending tools to blend in the darker color foundation until your skin looks sun-kissed.  To ensure that your makeup will stay flawless all day long, apply a dusting of translucent powder over your makeup. This will also help to soak up any extra oil and provide a matte look.         Use a large fluffy brush to apply your powder. Apply the powder all over your face.  

cleanse and moisturize your skin.  cover dark circles with concealer.  apply your foundation.  apply extra concealer over pimples.  blend in a darker shade for a sun-kissed look.  set your makeup with powder.

If they decline, tell them that it is a short film and is going on YouTube, if the person refuses this idea, ensure you promise them around 5% of final profits, if you are selling the film online or even at a retail outlet. You need to have at least 2 people on board by the end of the day. Also loosely think up a plot. You could even nag those friends and make them come over and watch films, help in script writing etc.; , Begin at 9 am, and the loose script should be done before 10 pm. If this is a short film, and you are creative, then the whole thing may be done before 5 pm but keep in mind that a full film script may take at least a day. Get everyone to pitch in.  At lunch you could go to Starbucks or something quick and resume recording at about 1:30 pm. During lunch, get a helper to go to the local fancy dress store and buy some props. You may be in luck and have a friend who owns cosplay outfits and is willing to share. For a horror or fantasy, you should buy some "colour hair-spray" which dyes your hair for the day and the next day washes out like magic. If your script still isn't done, work on it during lunch.

 Since babies do not exercise or get as dirty as adults, their hair is also generally cleaner. Wash your baby's hair around 2 times a week.   Of course, if the hair is visibly dirty, you should wash the hair.; , If the bottle says "tear-free," it may be a good choice.   It would be best to ask your pediatrician what he/she recommends since the stores can be confusing. It may also be a good idea to purchase a non-scented shampoo so that the baby does not object to the smell.  Babies can become cold very quickly so heat your child up by cleaning their body first.   This will also help make your baby more comfortable and hopefully more cooperative.  Do not wrap it so tight that your baby is uncomfortable but make sure it is snug.   Try to fold your baby's arms across their chest before wrapping the towel around. This is a comfortable position for the baby to be in and will help them be more cooperative.  Consider your baby's stage of development. Many infants will require you to support their neck and head while being held and washed. Look at how to hold a baby properly if you do not know how already.   If the tub or sink is below your waist, kneel down next to the tub.  This will allow you to wash the hair while keeping the rest of the body dry.   This step may be easier if you wash your baby over a sink instead. This will only work, though, if the baby is small enough to be held over a sink.  Keep on doing so until all of your baby's hair is wet. The water should be warm enough to feel the heat but not so hot that it hurts to touch. Find a temperature comfortable for you and then make it slightly colder for your baby.   Take care not to let any water get to your baby's ears or eyes. This will be uncomfortable for the baby just as it is for you. Try to angle your baby's head slightly back so that the water will flow away from the eyes and ears.  The amount will depend on the thickness of your baby's hair, but try not to use more than the size of a quarter.   You will need to set your baby down or hand him/her off to another person for this step.  Use gentle, circular motions to create a small amount of lather. Use the tips of your fingers to massage and clean the scalp. Do not run your fingernails along the scalp, though.   You should only need to shampoo their hair for around 20-30 seconds since the hair will not be too dirty or sweaty.  You may need to use more water in order to remove all of the shampoo.   Try to gently run your hand through your baby's hair to make sure all of the shampoo is gone.  Do not dry too vigorously. Try to palm your baby's head and move your hand in slow circles while holding the base of the head and the neck.   Try to use a warm washcloth to help soothe the baby.  

know that your baby's hair should not be washed every day.  purchase a shampoo which is not too hard on the skin as babies are much more sensitive than adults.  be sure to wash your baby's body before beginning their hair.  take your baby out of the tub and wrap him/her in a warm, dry towel.  position yourself so that you can safely hold your baby over the tub or sink.  hold your baby so that only his or her head is over the tub.  use either a cup or your palm to gently pour lukewarm water over your baby's hair.  take a small amount of shampoo into your palm.  gently lather up your baby's head with the shampoo.  wash the shampoo out of your baby's hair using the same method as in step 6.  grab your washcloth to dry your baby's hair. 

 The person invited will be well informed about the precise location where the social gathering will be held. A detailed road map showing the route and supported with indication signs will make possible reaching the destination.   Include postal address details, such as the street name, number, city area, town, postal code, and country. Take account of principal points, such as important businesses or buildings, airports, and trains or bus stations. Make use of abbreviations, such as St. for street.  

write the postal address of the establishment on your business card. 

 Look at what you have that a girl could want. From good looks to a nice cash flow or a good car, you could be used for any number of things. You can also be used for your clout, whether it's being a big name on a small campus or even becoming moderately famous.Of course, you don't have to be a big deal to be used. You can be taken advantage of no matter who you are. For instance, if the relationship is always one-sided, such as you're always driving her everywhere, you could be being taken advantage of.; , See if she only seems interested in going out with you if you take her somewhere nice. Watch if she just wants to just go somewhere where she can be seen with you.. She could also be just hanging around to meet certain co-workers. Keep an eye out if she's more interested in that than in just spending time with you.She could also be looking for a free ride, literally, or just someone who will be there when she needs something.  That is, some women may use you by only calling when they want something. Maybe they want you to fix something or pick up something for them. Pay attention to when women call and how they talk on the phone with you. If she only calls every few weeks and seems to want a favor each time, she may not be that into you., If she only wants to chat you up at work, she may just be using you to get ahead. You can check by asking her out on a date, but be careful, since work relationships can be tricky. Similarly, if she works somewhere else but only calls you at work to ask work questions, she could just be using you., Some people may assume that men should still pay for everything. However, that's usually not a true statement anymore. If she never even offers to pay for anything, even if you refuse, she could be using you., That is, when you talk on the phone or get together, see if she only talks about herself. If she doesn't take the time to listen to what's going in with you, then she's probably not in it for the long haul., That is, maybe she will only do things she wants to do. Alternatively, maybe she'll call only when something is going on in town, such as a big concert or a new club opening, that she wants you to pay for.She may also be hesitant to hang out when you suggest something, but eager when she wants to go somewhere., If she's always trying to keep her options open, rather than committing to plans with you, she could be just wanting to play the field. However, she also could just be stringing you along., If she's only calling late, say after 10 or 11 pm, she may just want to have sex with you. You do have to take her schedule into consideration; she may be calling late because that's when she gets out of class or off work. Of course, if you're both open to that type of relationship, it's fine. However, if you want more than that, you may need to end it., Everyone does something wrong sometimes. You apologize and move on. However, if she never seems to want to apologize, that's likely a sign she doesn't care about the relationship. She may even use tears to move the situation along without her having to admit she was wrong.Of course, apologizing goes both ways. You have to be willing to apologize in a relationship, too.  If she's proud to be in the relationship, she'll be happy to call you her boyfriend. However, if she doesn't want to acknowledge you publicly, she may be using you, especially if you've talked about being exclusive in private., Meaning, see if she actually wants you to meet her friends and family. If she deflects questions about getting together with her friends, she may be using you. A person who is excited to be in an honest relationship will likely want you to meet the other people she cares about., That is, does she suddenly drop off the map if you're low on cash. Do you know see her if your car is in for repairs and you sometimes give her a ride? If you notice she's only around when you have something material to offer, she's likely using you.Similarly, if she's all sweetness and light when she's asking for something but then turns mean once she gets it, she may just be using you., For instance, if she's constantly cancelling plans, she doesn't value your time. Everyone has to cancel sometimes, but if she is always bowing out at the last minute, that could be a sign she's not into you. Similarly, if she constantly wants you to change what other plans you have, she's saying she doesn't care about what you value., Think about what you want to say beforehand, and remember to include specific examples of how you think she is using you.Don't be angry or antagonistic. Try to keep the conversation polite and calm. Ask her what she thinks about the situation.Be ready for some anger. If the person is using you, she'll likely deny it and be angry about it.

; , Note what you can see at each of the corners. Flick your eyes from corner to corner to corner and look carefully, so that when you take the viewfinder down, you can still see the parameter of the image that you will be working on in your mind's eye. , Quarter it vertically and horizontally, so that it is split in half both ways. This breaks down the complexity of the image that is in front of you into four smaller elements that are going to be easier to control.  This is an information gathering exercise; you are making a map from observation of what will be the painting. Think in terms of the design, the pattern and the overall composition. This step gives you thinking time before you set about the process of painting and transferring the image to the painting surface.  

purchase or make a viewfinder.  look through your viewfinder.  roughly draw the same proportions as the aperture of the viewfinder on your sketchbook paper.  ,  divide the space into quarters.  start from the bottom right quarter. 

; , Try to get something that is around 8 by 12 inches (20.32 by 30.48 centimeters) or 9 by 13 inches (22.86 by 33.02 centimeters)., Measure out the old fashioned oats, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, and brown sugar. For extra flavor, add some ground nutmeg. Put everything into a large bowl, and mix together until evenly combined.  You can use another bowl, or a large, glass measuring cup. Beat everything together until the yolks break, and you get an even color. There should be no streaks or swirls.  Keep stirring with a whisk or spatula until everything is evenly combined.  Popular choices include berries or apples. You can also use 2 cups (200 grams) worth of other ingredients as well, such as chopped nuts or bananas.  Gently sway the baking dish from side to side. This will help spread your mixture evenly across the baking dish, and help everything settle.  The oats should be set; they should not jiggle much when you move them.  For extra flavor, drizzle some milk or honey over the oatmeal. You can also top it with ground cinnamon or raisins. If you end up having any leftovers, put them into the refrigerator. 

preheat the oven to 350°f (176.7°c).  lightly grease a glass baking dish, and set it aside.  mix together the dry ingredients in a large bowl.  in a separate container, whisk together the milk, eggs, and vanilla.  pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture, then sir in the melted butter.  pour half of the oatmeal mixture into the baking dish, then top with your desired filling.  pour the rest of the oatmeal mixture over your filling.  bake, uncovered, for 30 to 45 minutes, or until the top turns golden brown.  let cool for a few minutes, then cut and serve.  finished.  

 You can use a normal kind of paint, but you might have an easier time using a fine-tipped paint marker. A paint marker can be held like a pencil and will likely be a more familiar tool for adding a message to your box. Write things like:   The names of the bride and groom. With this ring… Mr. & Mrs., Lace is a beautiful, delicate addition that integrates nicely with most wedding décor. Wrap the top of your box in lace and use a hot glue gun to attach it to the insides of the box. Cut strips of lace, tie them into decorative bows, and attach them to the box with hot glue.   If you plan on covering the bottom of your box in lace, you can often tuck your lace beneath the inner padding/pillow of your box., High quality beads and faux pearls can be used to make neat designs on your box. For example, you might cutout the shape of a heart on a piece of card stock and then border it with fake pearls. Attach this to your box with a suitable glue, like hot glue.Designs like these can be added freehand to your box or with a guide, like a stencil. Beads and pearls can be glued to cutouts and attached, as well.  The fabric on the inside of your box can be whatever pattern you desire. For example, if you and your fiancé are fans of a TV show like Doctor Who, you might use Doctor Who themed fabric for your box padding. Other ideas include themed patterns representing:   Movies Books TV shows Hobbies  , Much like lace, ribbons are great for tying bows. Choose a suitable length of ribbon, tie your bow, and attach it to your box with a little bit of hot glue. Be creative with your bow placement. A few small bows on the sides, for example, might be the perfect addition to your box.   Thicker ribbon will create more prominent bows. Use these for centerpieces in the box design or at anchor points, like at the corners. Smaller bows may be hard to see from a distance, but will add a delicate aspect to the box. These work well along the sides or as an accent to more central designs.

 For example, if someone is trying to change the topic, the conversation is certainly not over. Don't appear forceful, trying to end a conversation. Don't end it unless you have a good reason, like time crunch.; , Is a normally swift person taking longer to reply? Is he/she appearing bored? Are the only words you exchange now, "okay"?  , Continue with how you should meet up soon and talk again. If you are bored, say you have another appointment.  bye!" or something like that. If you have to go, they will realize that the conversation will end like it or not.  It is now your choice to wait for their response or to leave. If this person does not reply soon (considering that they normally reply fast), take the message and stop talking.  

make sure that the conversation is truly over.  look for clues that the conversation should end.  say something along the lines of, "it was great talking to you.",  just say "gotta go!,  if the person responds similarly, bid farewell one last time. 

 The filling, whether you choose to use old blankets or towels, will need to be rolled up lengthwise. Lay the filling out flat and roll it up tightly, like a yoga mat.Consider using rubber bands or string to bind the rolled-up filling. This will make it easier to stuff the filling inside your pillow case or cloth, and will also help keep the bolster tight during use. Once the filling is rolled, you'll need to insert it into the sheath. If you're using a pillow case, this should be fairly easy. All you'll need to do is slide the filling inside the pillow case, while retaining the tight wrap of the filling., If the bolster is too small, you can add additional filling (towels or blankets) to create a longer or thicker bolster. If it's too large, you can scale back on your filling. Ultimately, though, the size of the finished product should be determined by your body and your needs.   A common size for cylindrical bolsters is 24 inches long by eight inches high. Some yoga practitioners find this height ideal for well-supported forward bends and a deep chest opening.Some yoga practitioners prefer a smaller bolster for supporting the neck, knees, and spine. If you want a smaller bolster, try aiming for 16 inches long and five to six inches high., If you used a pillow case, securing the open end will be easy. Simply use a rubber band or piece of string to tightly tie the open end shut.This will give you a functional bolster that can still be taken apart as needed.  

roll and insert the filling.  check your measurements.  secure the bolster. 

 This is an important step if you are using old photographs, but it may not be applicable if you are using digital copies. Scan in old photographs to your computer, then print new versions before gluing pictures to a page, then save the old photographs for traditional photo albums.  This will help to express your themes. Write/type on the top of the page or use scrapbook stickers to spell out the title, such as "Vacation 2012" or "Daddy's Little Girl."  , Glue the elements to the page and allow them to dry very well before placing it in your book. A scrapbook page can be simple, featuring 1 or 2 photos, or it can be filled with photos, poems and decorations.   If your young child wants to make a Father's Day scrapbook, create glueless pages out of contact paper. Buy a 3 ring binder and measure pages that will fit in the binder. Cut pieces of contact paper in that size and gather elements, such as photos, stickers and children's art. Your child can lay the elements on the sticky side of the contact paper after the protective sheet has been removed. Place another piece of contact paper over the top when they are finished. Use a 3 hole punch on the page and stick it in a binder.  Whether you are printing from a digital layout or crafting a physical copy by hand, leave blank pages at the end of the scrapbook. You can update the scrapbook every year or occasionally as an extra present to your dad.  Include a good picture of the family or the 2 of you together. Print out the final copy or place all the dried pages inside the binder.  

make duplicates of your photographs.  choose a title for each page of your scrapbook.  create your scrapbook pages 1 by 1, following your chosen themes.  consider leaving blank space in the back of your scrapbook, in order to update it in the future.  decorate the cover of your binder or your digital page, with your father's name, the date and your name. 

 If an idea captures your and won't let go you've got to pursue it. Great artists don't worry if it will sell, if it fits current artistic trends, or will take a long time to make. Great artists jump into their passions with open arms, trusting themselves to make it work. If you want a unique, refreshing artistic voice, then you need to trust your voice.   It can be hard to embark on a project that feels weird, new, and experimental. But remember -- if you can't get passionate about the project, how can you expect your audience to feel passionately about it?, There is a reason burgeoning painters spend time sculpting, and vice versa. All forms of art are intrinsically linked, and they share similar vocabulary and skills (color, shading, composition, etc.). By pushing yourself to approach art differently, you open yourself up to a wealth of new influences, techniques, and styles.   Push yourself to get out of your comfort zone -- this is often where you make the biggest breakthroughs and personal discoveries. This includes other forms of art, such as writing and music. Creative expression, whether with a paintbrush or a piccolo, is about getting your ideas out of your head and into the audiences. The medium you use to do that doesn't matter., Great artists are often great readers, using books and literature to push themselves to new ideas and philosophies. They are unashamed of their past, no matter what it is, and are confident using it for motivation and inspiration. Furthermore, great artists rarely say "no." They keep their minds open to everything, becoming a sponge of influences that come together to make something incredibly unique, and incredibly you.  For most artists, art is a form of communication. You create art because you want to share it with other people. Otherwise, you could just leave the ideas in your head. Exactly how you want to show your work and to who is your choice. You could try to get your work shown in galleries and put up for sale. You could try getting published. You might be more comfortable putting your work online and possibly selling prints of it. Or maybe you would rather just frame some of your best work and hang it up in your home for your family and friends to enjoy.   Ask for honest critiques, and try to accept them with grace. You will never catch everything, and your audience's opinion will help find areas to improve in. Ask people what they think about the art, and what it might mean. Does it match up with your own thoughts and ideas? Did you accomplish your goals with the piece? Could you better communicate them your goals, or are you happy with ambiguity and differing opinions?  , Constructive criticism is designed to help you improve your artwork, either the piece you're working on now or your future works. A person giving constructive criticism will usually point out both the flaws and the strengths in your piece and make suggestions on how you could fix the flaws. While it isn't always fun to hear, criticism is something you're going to have to deal with as an artist. Learn to identify when a criticism of your work is valid and use that information to focus on correcting your mistakes.  

trust your gut when choosing projects.  experiment in a wide variety of styles and disciplines.  draw influence from your entire life, not just your artistic pursuits.  show your work to others for thoughts and feedback.  accept constructive criticism. 

 Eczema on the hands and fingers is a common condition. If you suspect that you have some form of eczema, see a doctor to get your condition diagnosed and treated. You may have eczema if you notice any of the following symptoms on your hands or fingers:Redness Itching Pain Extreme dryness Cracks Blisters; , Irritant contact dermatitis is the most common form of hand eczema. This form of eczema is caused by frequent and prolonged exposure to substances that irritate the skin.

Symptoms of this type of eczema include:chapping and redness on the fingertips and in the webbed areas between your fingers stinging and burning when you make contact with irritants  , Some people suffer from a form of eczema called allergic contact dermatitis. In this case, the eczema is caused by an allergy to a substance such as a soap, dye, fragrance, rubber, or even a plant. Symptoms of this type of eczema are often concentrated on the inside of the hands and fingertips, but they can appear anywhere on the hands. Symptoms include:blistering, itchiness, swelling, and redness soon after exposure to the allergen crusting, scaling, and cracking of the skin darkening and/or thickening of the skin after prolonged exposure to the allergen  , Hand eczema caused by atopic dermatitis is more common in children than in adults, but adults can still suffer from this condition. If you have symptoms of eczema on other parts of your body as well as on your hands, atopic dermatitis might be causing your hand eczema. Symptoms of atopic dermatitis include:extreme itchiness that lasts for days or weeks thickening of the skin lesions on the skin

 Look at pictures of Sir Isaac Newton and study his face carefully.; , If you have natural wavy hair, you're in luck you don't need to use the iron curlers or straighteners. Skip this step.  Skip this step if your hair is naturally brown, gray, or white. This step is optional since there are a few pictures of Isaac Newton with blonde or black hair. If your hair is red, dye it brown, gray or white.  Sir Isaac Newton wore: Egg white blouse- crumbled. Black haired over coat that went down to his shin. Hairy gray pants that went down to the top of his ankle. You must wear something similar to the 1700s fashion. Wear a buttoned coat, get a powdered wig (optional), wear black buckle shoes, a white ruffled shirt, long white stockings up to your knees, and shorts up to your knees.  In the earlier part of his life, Newton was a deeply introverted character and fiercely protective of his privacy. Even in his maturity, having become rich, famous, laden with honors and internationally acclaimed as one of the world's foremost thinkers, he remained deeply insecure, given to fits of depression and outbursts of violent temper. The term “darkness” can be applied to much of Newton's personality. Adjectives that have been used to describe facets of his personality include “remote”, “lonely”, “secretive”, “introverted”, “melancholic”, “humorless”, “puritanical”, “cruel”, “vindictive” and, perhaps worst of all, “unforgiving”.  Don't laugh or smile and don't be mean to others. Draw a line in the middle of your chin for a dimple. Isaac Newton has a dimple on his chin.  Isaac Newton was left handed. 

make your hair like isaac newton by parting your hair to the left side of your head.  then make your hair wavy.  color your your hair brown, gray, or white.  get the right type of clothing.  to be like isaac newton, change your behavior.  to look more like isaac newton, you have to look very serious.  be left handed, or try.  now you will look somewhat similar to this man wearing an isaac newton costume.  

 Instead of using an acronym or technical jargon, use a relevant word or phrase that provides the same meaning. For example, business people like to use SME’s (pronounced like "smees") to describe a person who is a Subject Matter Expert. The time you save by saying “SMEES” is lost when it causes an unfamiliar listener to try to figure out what you mean. Just say “Subject Matter Expert” or “Expert” or “Business Owner” or something to describe the same thing. If you cause your audience to have to think about your last words then they will stop listening until they figure out what you meant.; , If you have the opportunity to discuss a topic that you know a lot about, it is easy to talk at a level of detail that nobody can follow (or care about) except you. People typically only care that the overall process works, not how it works. In sales you talk about benefits with the assurance that the product works, not the features or how it works. Eventually the question will come up where you can bring up the details but that should be based on knowing that your audience wants those details.  The titles people give you in introducing themselves at the beginning of a meeting may be impressive, but not necessarily indicative of what they care about. Don’t rely on their role or title. Instead ask how much detail your audience wants from you. This will not only help you earn their respect it also helps you stay on time and on track.  

use words and phrases your audience understands.  be concise and talk about what’s important to your audience.  ask your audience what they want to hear from you.

 You may think that that can of soda at dinnertime is sufficient time for the effects to wear off, but science says it's not. It can last in your system for up to twelve hours.Heck, that means avoiding it at lunch! But at least science isn't taking away your morning cup of joe.   In case it wasn't implied clearly enough, having loads of sugar isn't great for your sleepiness either. Even if you avoid the soda, stay away from the overly sugary juices and caffeine free but not sugar free beverages, too.  Not including the other obvious reasons you should quit smoking, nicotine can also interrupt your sleep schedule -- it's a stimulant. What's more, you may wake up in the middle of the night with a nicotine craving. That's no good for your sleep cycles, either., Whether that means going for your lunch in the park or just throwing open all the curtains, make sure your brain gets stimulated by enough daylight. The sun is a natural cue to your brain that it's time to wake up. Need an excuse to walk the dog? There you go!   Remove your sunglasses in the morning for an instant, "WOAH, I'M AWAKE" feeling. The more your eyes can soak in, the better. And if you've got a case of the winter woes, think of investing in a light therapy box. It causes your body to release melatonin the same way the sun does.That being said, you want a room that's dark at night. You may find investing in a good set of light-eliminating curtains blocks out that street light and cuts down on your falling-asleep time. Just make sure to throw 'em open in the morning!  , That doesn't mean you have to turn into an Olympic athlete -- just 30 minutes a day of aerobic exercise (the heart-pounding kind) can help you sleep better.Break it up into smaller chunks if that's better for your schedule; you'll still reap the benefits.   If possible, work out in the late afternoon, but before dinner. If you work out within 4 hours of going to bed, it could just rev you up., When you go to bed, you want to neither be hungry or stuffed -- either feeling can keep you awake. So if you tend to eat your dinner late, this is even more important. The alternative is going to bed later, but you don't want that either!   Rich, fatty foods are harder for the stomach to digest.

 You've noticed your skin is sensitive, but getting a little more information on what, exactly, is going on with your skin can be very helpful when you are trying to choose the best products for your skin.   If you have acne-prone skin, skin that is especially oily, or skin that has very dry patches, you will need to address those concerns with products formulated for those skin types. Sensitive skin is prone to irritation, so it's important to use as few products as possible in your skincare routine. Identify your main issues of concern, and address those, but be careful about causing additional issues by using too many products.; , There are many products on the market, but your sensitive skin is unlikely to react well to a long process of trial-and-error to find the right one. Instead, try these suggestions for sensitive skin.   Choose products that are fragrance-free and alcohol-free to minimize irritation.Look for products that say "sensitive" on the label, like Olay Foaming Face Wash.Despite its title, this product does not create much of a lather. In general, the more foam a product creates, the more it will strip your skin of its protective barrier oils, so products with just a touch of lather or none at all are ideal. Other brands with cleansers for sensitive skin include Clinique, Cetaphil, CeraVe, Eucerin, and Avène.Try facial wipes. Wipes are convenient and if you find that they are too harsh for your skin, you can moisten them with water to dilute the ingredients. Many wipes contain fragrances and alcohol, so look for one without these products, like Simple Oil Balancing face wipes.Opt out of "soaps" altogether. If you do not get especially dirty on a day-to-day basis, there is no need to use a soap product. Warm water and a washcloth can gently clean your facial skin. Another great option is coconut oil. A small amount rubbed all over the face and removed with warm, wet washcloth can cleanse the skin and also remove even stubborn make-up. Be cautious when exfoliating. If your skin is sensitive, don't exfoliate more than once or twice weekly. If you have other skin issues, such as inflammatory acne, you will want to speak with a dermatologist before attempting to exfoliate. Remember that just because a product works well for someone else with sensitive skin, it might not work well for you. Additionally, more expensive products are not necessarily better than cheaper ones.  Washing your face more often than is necessary strips your skin of its natural protective barrier and leaves it dry and vulnerable to irritation. You should only wash your face once or twice a day.Wash your face at the end of the day, just before bed, and then immediately apply a mild moisturizer or cream. Be sure to remove all makeup or other products from your skin. In the morning, unless you have very oily skin, you do not need to wash your face. Instead, rub some lukewarm water on your face and then pat dry with a towel. After a night of sleeping on a clean pillow without makeup, you don't need to use a harsh cleanser., The right temperature of water is crucial to avoid irritating your skin. Warm or cool water is usually best for washing your face.   Hot water will strip your skin of its natural protective oils and can also scald it. While it is a myth that cold water closes your pores, it can help to keep them from producing excess oil, so if that is one of your skincare concerns, consider using cold water., While some products may have different instructions, generally the process is similar regardless of what type of product you choose.   Splash cool or warm water on your face. This will help the product penetrate the oil and dirt on your face. Apply a very small amount of the product to your fingertips. In general, a pea-sized amount should do, although some products do not spread as well as others so you may need more. Some people prefer to use a washcloth, but unless it is very soft and you use a very light touch, the fibers on a washcloth can be abrasive to sensitive skin. Rub the product between your hands until it forms a lather (or, if you have a non-lathering product, until the product is evenly distributed between your hands). Then, beginning with your forehead, massage the product gently into the moist skin on your face. Avoid your eye and lip areas and nostrils.  Splash the water onto your face and gently rub with your hands until the soap is removed.   Be sure to remove all the product from your skin. Again, using a washcloth is not recommended for sensitive skin. Dry with a clean, soft towel, using a patting motion rather than rubbing in order to protect the skin from abrasion.  Most people with sensitive skin need a protective layer to re-hydrate the skin after cleansing. Look for products marked specifically for sensitive skin, which tend to be fragrance-free and free of harsh chemicals.   If you will be outdoors at all, even to drive a car, be sure that you use a product with sunscreen. Choose a sunscreen offering broad spectrum coverage and an SPF of 30.If your skin is sensitive to chemical sunscreens, try a broad spectrum sunscreen containing a physical blocker like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, which tends to be gentle on sensitive skin.Other gentle moisturizers that often work well for people with sensitive skin include Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion for oily to normal skin or Bare Minerals Purely Nourishing Cream for very dry skin.  While you may need certain products to address your skin care concerns, a minimalist skincare routine is best for people with sensitive skin.If you have no other major issues with your skin (like eczema, acne, or extreme oiliness or dryness), it is possible that you can reduce your skincare routine to a mild face wash, a sunscreen, and a moisturizer. In some cases, the sunscreen and moisturizer might be the same product. Remember that cosmetic products can also be irritating, so choose formulas that are fragrance-free, non-comedogenic (that is, won't clog your pores), and with as few ingredients as possible. Some brands that claim to be good for sensitive skin include Clinique and bareMinerals.  It's possible that your skin's sensitivity is caused by an allergy or similar concern, which can be treated or managed with lifestyle changes.   If the skin on your face or lips is chronically itchy, dry (especially in patches), or red and inflamed, it's possible that environmental allergens (pets, dust, ragweed, etc.) might be to blame. Typically, an allergic reaction won't be localized to your face, so itchy skin on your hands, arms, knees, or other areas might be an indication of an allergy. Some food allergies, like a gluten or milk allergies, can cause reactions in the skin. Even nut allergies can manifest as hives, itchy skin, or redness around the mouth. An allergist (a doctor specializing in allergies) can help you determine if your sensitive skin is caused by environmental or food allergies by giving you skin-prick or patch test.  It's possible that your skin's sensitivity is caused by an allergy or sensitivity to the products that you use on your face or around your home, which can be managed by switching products.   If you have itchy, red, uncomfortable, or inflamed skin on your face or lips, it's possible that you have an allergy or sensitivity to a product that you use. Consider whether your face wash, scrub, toner, sunscreen, moisturizer, cosmetics, lip balm, or any other product that comes into contact with your face might be causing a reaction. You can try eliminating products individually for about a week each, in order to see if you have any improvement of your symptoms. You might also have an allergy or sensitivity to products that you use, such as your laundry detergent, or a perfume or hand lotion that might come in contact with your face. There is also the possibility that a partner's products (cosmetics or after shave, for instance) might be causing a reaction on your skin. It has been observed that children with sensitive skin or atopic dermatitis may be prone to food allergies. You may want to have a skin prick test to see if food allergies are causing your dermatitis or sensitive skin.  Most people who say they have sensitive skin never see a dermatologist. If that describes you, it is possible that you are living with a skin condition that is treatable.Some issues that seem like mere skin sensitivity are actually eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, or other skin issues. Each of these skin conditions has its own root cause and treatment plan.If you've never been to a dermatologist, it's a good idea to visit one to rule out other skin conditions. If you do find out you have a skin condition, the dermatologist can prescribe creams or oral medications to treat it. Eczema or atopic dermatitis can be treated a number of way including creams to affect the immune system, antibiotics to prevent infection, antihistamine to stop itching, and stress modifications. 

identify your skin issues.  choose the right cleanser.  know when to use it.  use warm or cool water.  wash your face.  rinse well with warm or cool water.  apply a gentle moisturizer.  avoid unnecessary products.  determine if your skin's sensitivity has environmental causes.  determine if you are allergic to your products.  determine if you have other dermatological issues. 

 Each sheep fleece is classified by a wool classer, who evaluates the fiber diameter, staple strength, staple length, yield and color. Before purchasing a sheep fleece, ask the seller about its classification.  The fiber diameter, which is sometimes call fineness, is the thickness of the wool fiber measured in microns (one millionth of a meter). The finer the wool, the higher the quality. The fiber diameter should be uniform across a sheep fleece. Merino wool, which is the highest quality wool available, typically has a fiber diameter between 12 and 24 microns. On the other end of the spectrum, carpet wools have a fiber diameter between 35 and 45 microns.  The natural bend or waviness of a wool fiber is called the crimp. Wool fibers exhibit natural elasticity, and can be bent approximately 30,000 times without breaking. The crimp varies along the diameter of the fiber, and can help predict how fine the wool is. Fine wools typically have more crimp per unit than coarser wools.  To determine the staple length, measure from the base to the tip along an unstretched fiber. Length adds weight to the fleece; therefore, longer staple lengths are preferred over shorter staple lengths. The ideal staple length is between 2 and 4 inches (5.8 and 10.2 cm) because it is easiest to process or spin into yarn at that length.  The yield is the amount of wool left after scouring. After it is washed, wool shrinks. The yield typically is posted as a percentage of the original greasy wool weight. The yield can vary from 40 to 70 percent. The bulkier the fleece, the higher the yield.  Many farmers who raise their sheep specifically for wool take precautions to keep the wool protected. Ask about what efforts are made to prevent contamination of fleeces, whether the sheep are protected with coats, and what type of bedding is provided for the sheep. Inquire about the type of plants in the pastures and how the sheep are fed. The answers to these questions will provide insight as to the care of the sheep and the quality of the fleece.  

consider the wool classification.  evaluate the fiber diameter.  consider the crimp.  evaluate the staple length.  consider the yield.  ask the sheep farmer or wool provider about the care of the sheep. 

 It's the white ghost outline on a yellow background.  If you aren't already logged into Snapchat, tap Log In and enter your username (or email address) and password.; , This will open your profile., It's in the top right corner of the screen., You'll find this in the "Additional Services" section., It will turn green. Now you'll be able to use filters in your Snaps!  If the switch is green, filters are already enabled.  Do so by tapping the back button in the top left corner of your screen until you reach the profile page, then swiping up on the screen., After a brief moment, you should see icons pop up to the right of the camera button.  If your camera isn't already facing you, tap the camera icon in the top right corner of your screen. If you’re applying the face filter to yourself or a friend, tap on the face to which you want to apply the filter.  Once you settle on a filter, you'll be able to record with it enabled.  Some effects will change your voice if you speak with them enabled. These effects will briefly display "Voice Changer" on the screen when selected.  Doing this will record a video. You can record up to 10 seconds of video with Snapchat., This will apply filters to your snap., If you're using filters for the first time, you'll likely be prompted to allow Snapchat to access your device's location. Location access is required to be able to see any available geofilters in your area., The color filters can change the emotional feel of your video.  For example, using the black and white filter can add some nostalgia to the video. You can usually swipe the screen left to quickly access the color filters.  Geofilters are location-based filters created by the Snapchat community. Many towns and cities have several geofilters to choose from, and you can find filters for landmarks and other locations as well. You can find the geofilters quickly by swiping from left to right after recording your video Snap.  If your town doesn't have a geofilter yet, you can create and submit one yourself.  This will play the video backwards allowing for effects like impossible catches., This filter has a picture of a rabbit, and will speed up the entire video to twice the original speed. You can use this to make a funny sped-up video, and is great for taking videos of your pets., This filter has a picture of a snail, and will slow down the video. One of the best uses for this filter is bypassing Snapchat's usual ten second limit on Snaps. By recording a full length, ten second video and applying the slow-motion filter, you can send a 20 second video Snap., Press and hold a filter and then swipe with another finger to combine two filters. You can combine many of the filters, such as the reverse filter with a geofilter, or the fast-forward filter with the black and white filter.  You can't combine two filters that both have text in the center, such as the time and the speed filters.

 The more ways you present a topic, the more chances your student will have to resonate with the information you offer. Try working problems, discussing prominent scientists in the field you are tutoring, and allowing the student to connect to different aspects of your topic. This makes the topic more engaging and digestible for students., Science can sometimes be pretty technical and tedious. Introduce a bit of humor and fun to the lesson. Make jokes about your subject matter, even if they are nerdy science jokes. You can also use flash cards or other systems to create fast paced quiz games.An example of a chemistry joke might be “You know why I don’t trust atoms? Because I heard they make up everything!”  , Your students will need to have frequent opportunities to work through science problems and concepts. Allow them to work through an idea from start to finish, and then give them constructive feedback about their process. Make sure that you explain the concepts involved when correcting them, and ask them to explain the concepts back to you., Allow your students to talk more than you do. If you are tutoring multiple students, give them a chance to discuss problems with each other. Any time a question, or answer, is given, allow the students to reflect on the science concepts behind the question.For example, if you are covering material related to the shape of a water molecule, you might ask the students to consider why it is a different shape from another three atom molecule, such as carbon dioxide. Rather than telling them the answer right off, prompt them to think about the electrons on oxygen. You might say “What is it about oxygen that would push the hydrogens closer to each other, giving water a bent geometry?”  , A change of scenery from time to time will give your tutoring sessions a natural, relaxed feel. Get out of the classroom and go to science exhibits, or do your own experiments that are relevant to the topic you are tutoring. This breaks the monotony of the classroom.For example, if you are teaching a chemistry lesson, you might go outside and demonstrate how some household chemicals react. Pay particular attention to how each student acts in each study place. Some students may need more structured environments, while others need a more casual space.  Your students will be able to tell you if they are learning well or not. Listen to what they have to say. If they seem hesitant to speak up, provide a survey for them. The survey questions should prompt them to tell you what you are doing well, and what you could improve on.Try to make your survey anonymous and say something like “I need your feedback to make sure that I’m meeting your needs.” An example survey question might be “How comfortable are you speaking about the material we cover in a tutoring session?”  

vary how you present information.  keep a light touch.  practice often.  encourage critical thinking.  vary your study place.  get feedback from students. 

 These cables have an HDMI plug on one end and a smaller HDMI plug on the other end, as opposed to traditional HDMI cables.  The 2017 line of Kindle Fire HD's does not support HDMI output. If your TV doesn't support HDMI input, you'll also need to buy an HDMI-to-analog converter box and a set of RCA male-to-male cables.  The large end of the cable should go into the TV, and the small end connects to your Kindle Fire HD's micro-HDMI port.  The micro-HDMI port is next to the charging port on the bottom of the Kindle Fire HD. If you're using an HDMI-to-analog converter: plug the Kindle Fire HD into the converter using the HDMI cable, then plug the converter into the TV with the RCA cables.  You should see your Kindle Fire HD's screen reflected on your TV's screen, though you may need to rotate your Kindle Fire HD in order for the display to appear right-side-up on your TV.  If necessary, you'll also need to change your TV's input to match the slot to which the Kindle Fire HD is attached (e.g., Video 3).

 Begin your studies by learning the pronunciation of Turkish words. Turkish uses the Latin alphabet, and each character is pronounced individually and phonetically. There are a few sounds that differ from English:c is pronounced like an English j (in jam). So ‘’’sadece’’’ (only/just) is pronounced sah-deh-jeh ç is pronounced like an English ch (in charge) – not s as in Latin based languages. ğ is silent (elongates previous vowel sound) ş is “sh” ı – looks like an i without the dot. ı is pronounced as a “schwa,” or gentle "uh" sound.Umlauted ö/ü vowels work as in German. ö is pronounced like "er" without the hard "r" sound. ü is pronounced like "ooh" when your lips are pursed.; , Understanding the sentence structure of Turkish will help you to learn the language. Words are also attached together to change their meanings.Turkish sentences use a Subject-Object-Verb order. Many words can be added as suffixes to the root word to change its meaning. There are no gender forms of words or articles such as "the".  Buy a dual-language dictionary to translate Turkish into English or another language you know well. Use the dictionary to look up and study new words.  Learn how to speak common phrases to develop a broader conversational base. Use your phrase book to look up and memorize useful phrases.English: Hi Turkish: Merhaba (mehr hah bah) English: Welcome Turkish: Hoş geldiniz! (Hosh gel din iz) English: I’m Lost Turkish: Kayboldum (kahy bohl doom) English: Where is the bathroom? Turkish:Tuvalet nerede? (too-vah-let neh-reh-dey) English: Yes Turkish: Evet (eh vet) English: No Turkish: Hayır (Hah yuhr)  , Learn phrases common in conversations and have conversations with yourself to practice asking and answering questions. Listen to spoken recordings of phrases online or on tapes from your local library.   English: Do you speak English? Turkish: İngilizce biliyor musunuz? (een-gee-leez jeh-bee-lee-yohr moo-soo-nooz) English: I can't speak Turkish. Turkish: Türkçe konuşamıyorum. (Tuerck-che conusha-me-yoor-uhm) English: How are you today? Turkish: Nasılsınız? (na suhl suhn uhz) English: I'm fine, thank you. Turkish: İyiyim, teşekkürler (ee yee yeem teh shek ür lerr) English: Am I under arrest? Turkish: Tutuklu muyum? (too-too-kloo mwee-yum)

 If you are on good terms with the other parent, work together to adjust the parenting plan so that it suits both of your needs and the needs of your child.   Child custody decisions typically need to be modified every two or three years anyway as the child grows.Two parents who are able to come to an agreement rationally will have a much easier time co-parenting their child.; , Most jurisdictions have forms that are pre-approved by the courts to file a joint motion to modify custody.If you can't find forms online, you can call the clerk's office and find out if they have forms available. Be sure you have all the documents you'll need to file your motion.Even though you and the other parent may agree to a change, it won't become legally binding unless you file a motion with the court and get a new order incorporating that change., The form requires information about the original child custody decision, why it isn't working, and how you propose to change it.   In addition to your joint motion form, the court may require other forms such as information sheets or attachments. If you found the form online, the packet you downloaded probably included any other forms you needed., You must file your joint motion in the court where the original custody decision was entered.Some courts don't charge a fee if you're filing a joint motion or motion by stipulation.If you do have to pay a fee to file your motion, typically under $100. If you can't afford the fee, ask the clerk for a fee waiver application. Provided you meet the court's income guidelines, you won't have to pay any filing fees for your case.The clerk will stamp your documents "filed" and give the copies back to you.If you're expected to appear in court, the clerk will let you know when your hearing is scheduled.Otherwise, he or she will let you know when you can expect the order to be entered.  In some jurisdictions, the judge will want to talk to you and the other parent before approving your joint motion.   At your hearing, you typically will need to bring a copy of your proposed parenting plan and a draft of the judge's order you want entered. Forms for the judge's order typically are available online or at the clerk's office.In many courts, if you want to make an informal change to your custody order by agreement a formal hearing isn't necessary.If you are required to appear in court, it typically is because the judge wants to confirm that the two of you are in agreement, that neither of you were manipulated or coerced into agreeing on the change, and that you believe it is in the best interests of your child.  

talk to the other parent.  search for forms.  fill out the form for a joint motion.  file your joint motion.  attend your hearing.

 In the first four months, a baby can only focus on an area between 8 and 12 inches from their face. Your baby will respond to movement in the first week.Exposing your baby to light during the day and small amounts at night can not only soothe them, but also help develop their ability to focus on you and other movements.Use a nightlight or another dim lamp in your baby’s room. The best way to tell if the nightlight is dim enough for your baby is that you can’t see the light through your eyelids.Choose a red or amber light to avoid disrupting the production of melatonin.; , Each of your baby’s eyes will develop on its own. In order to stimulate each eye equally, change your baby’s position in your arms or a crib frequently.Move the position of the crib frequently as well as where your baby is in it. Alternate sides when you are holding or feeding your baby., You likely interact a lot with your baby by talking to them or showing them toys. During your baby’s first four months, they will begin following you and other objects when they move. Make sure to keep any objects within 8-12 inches of your baby so that they can focus on them.Speak to your baby when you’re walking around the room. This can help further develop the ability to focus as they grow. Hold toys that are in bold geometric patterns and colors close to your baby. Recognize that babies don’t generally develop color vision until about 4 months old. However, showing them bold colors such as red, orange, yellow, blue, black and white can help develop color vision., At any age, your baby may have a problem or exhibit other potential issues with their eyesight. Seek prompt medical attention if your baby shows any of the following signs from birth to 2 years:Inability to track an object with their eyes by 3-4 months Trouble moving either or both eyes in all directions Jiggling eyes that cannot hold still One or both eyes crossed or turned outward Light sensitivity (blinking, closing eyes, or showing distress in light) Pupils that appear white Persistent draining or watering from eyes  , Your baby begins to develop hand-eye coordination and depth perception at around four months.Hanging objects such as mobiles or crib gyms above their crib or changing table allows your baby to pull, grab, and kick at the mobile. This helps further develop your baby’s eyesight.Make sure that toys and other objects you hang above the crib are easily within sight of your baby. Grasping for things will stimulate their vision.Remove mobiles or any other hanging objects from above your baby’s crib once they can push up on their hands and knees. This can prevent your baby from reaching the mobile, which increases the risk of strangulation.Consider hanging up a colorful poster near your baby’s changing table or close to the crib for further stimulation., Every baby needs plenty of time to play and explore. This can help your baby further develop and stimulate their vision, including hand-eye coordination and depth perception. Plan for plenty of play time for your baby that includes exploring the floor or base of a playpen.Place an array of colorful plastic or wooden blocks that your baby can grasp and hold. You can also use household objects such as ladles and balls to stimulate your baby’s vision., Games that move your baby’s hands and legs and involve talking further stimulate vision.As a part of your daily playtime, incorporate games such as patty cake and peek-a-boo. This can help develop your baby’s eyesight., If you haven’t started already, read your baby books. Select books with a simple story and colorful pictures that you can show to your baby. This helps develop your baby’s visualization abilities as well as providing even more enjoyment for you and your child., At around seven to ten months, your baby will recognize partially hidden objects.Incorporating hide and seek games with toys or even your face can further develop your baby’s eyesight, including visual memory.Place a soft blanket partially over a favorite toy such as a stuffed animal. Then say, “What is that, Vera? Where is Mickey Mouse?”Use a window to play hide and seek with your baby. Your baby will likely recognize you through the glass.  Your baby is likely becoming more curious with each passing month. Naming toys or other objects that your baby plays with helps develop their eyesight even more. It also encourages your baby’s word association skills and vocabulary development.Say the object clearly and offer praise when you’re naming things your baby has. For example, “Is that a block, Gabriel? Wow, you have a red block! And look, you stacked it on a blue block.”  , Between 8 and 12 months, your baby’s eyesight is connected to movement and memory. Encouraging crawling and creeping, along with other activities, can strengthen your baby’s ability to see things as well as touch and remember them.Let your baby have plenty of playtime that incorporates time on the floor for crawling or creeping from one piece of furniture to another.  Your baby began following movement with their eyes during the first few months of life. This skill will continue to develop as your baby gets older. By the time your baby is one to two years old, rolling a ball back and forth with them can further develop their eyesight. It also helps your child learn to track objects visually as well as develop hand-eye coordination.Use a brightly colored ball to further stimulate your baby’s eyesight. Identify the color to help with vocabulary and word association.  Eyesight is important to helping your baby develop fine motor skills as well as small muscle development. Give your baby toys such as zippers and building blocks that encourage hand-eye coordination. This can not only help develop their eyesight, but also boost fine motor skills and small muscle growth.The following toys and activities can help further develop your baby and toddler’s eyesight:Bright balls Blocks Zippers Peg hammering toys Markers and crayons Puzzles  , Many people start reading to their babies at a very young age or even in utero. Continuing to read and tell your baby stories past their first birthday can both help develop your child’s eyesight and visualization skills. This also will help your child learn and read in the long run.Show your child the pictures in storybooks or describe images to your child as you tell stories. For example, “Snow White was a fierce warrior who lived in a big white castle. The gardens were filled with beautiful and fragrant flowers in lots of pretty colors.”  

turn on a light in baby’s room.  change your baby’s position frequently.  keep objects within baby’s focus.  observe potential signs of trouble.  hang a colorful object above the crib or changing table.  give your baby play time.  enjoy games with your baby.  read your baby a story.  play hide and seek for visual memory.  name objects for word association skills.  encourage crawling and creeping.  roll a ball back and forth.  boost fine motor skills and small muscle development.  tell stories to stimulate visualization ability. 

 Draw a cross in the circle for the guidelines of the face.   Note that the body should only be a little larger than the head, and should be at a slight angle away from teh head. Keep the intersecting point of the cross-lines close to the center of the head.  Sketch two circles for the eyes and a half circle for the nose.   The eyes should be positioned over the horizontal center line, and should be at equal distance away from the vertical center. The nose should be on the vertical center line and below the eyes.  Sketch a small circle for the mouth area covering as well the nose area. This circle should be below the eyes, yet should completely cover the nose and overlap the bottom of the head circle.  This includes the legs and tail. The front legs should be two slightly curved lines coming off the front of the body oval, starting about three-quarters up and extending to the bottom, pointing away from the angle of the body.   The back legs should be two arrowhead shapes attached to the bottom of the oval. The tail should be a curved line sticking out from the bottom back of the oval.  The back of each circular paw should be attacked to the leg lines.  Draw two inwardly curved lines from either side of the head to either side of the body, forming the kitten's neck.  Draw thicker shapes around the leg lines and tail line to fill out the limbs. Add curved lines to the front of the paws to look like toes. Add a "W" shaped mouth connecting to the bottom of the nose.   You can also "roughen" the overall outline of the kitten with small, jagged strokes, creating the impression of fur.  Add more details like the fur lines and the pattern of the fur color, if desired. This can include stripes or other details.  Use any color you'd like, but make the mouth area slightly lighter so that it stands out. If you added stripes or patterns, color those a separate shade, as well.  

sketch a circle for the head and an oval for the body.  draw the face.  add the mouth.  draw lines for the extremities.  add the paws as circles.  connect the head with the body.  draw the basic outline of the kitten.  erase the unnecessary draft detail.  color the kitten. 

 If you have just received a phone call from the police informing you that your teenage child has been arrested and is being held at your local station, it’s important that you keep your composure. You will most likely be angry, upset and concerned, but you need to stay calm to deal with the situation as effectively as possible.Don’t rush to judgement, either of your child or the police officers who arrested him. You need to act quickly and go to where your child is being held, but you should find out more information about the situation before taking any actions beyond this.; , Once you receive the call you should head to the station straight away. You need to try and find out as much information about the arrest and the circumstances around it as possible. Try and speak to your child face-to-face, but understand that you have limited rights. You will generally be able to speak to your child before he is interviewed, but you don’t have a federal right to be present during the interview.   The rules vary by state, and some states do require consultation with parents for questioning. Your child has a right to have a lawyer present, but not necessarily to have a parent present. In most instance it is at the discretion of the investigating police officer, whether a parent is allowed to be present., You will probably be angry and upset with your child, but it’s important that you act calmly and get professional legal help. Don’t try to act as a lawyer or do anything which might encourage your child to incriminate himself. The best rule is not to say anything until you have a lawyer present.Well-meaning parents can hurt their child’s case by inadvertently waiving their rights, or agreeing to a search of their home unnecessarily.Even if you think your child has done something wrong, you shouldn’t make him talk to the police and confess to anything. The police may have a very weak case, and a criminal record can have a big impact on the rest of your child’s life., If the police intend to charge your child with a crime, you should not hesitate to get professional legal help. You should hire an attorney who is a specialist in Juvenile Law. A Juvenile Law attorney will be more focussed and experienced in dealing with teens, and will work towards finding a solution that is in the best interests of your child.   This could include a drug treatment programme, counselling, or something else. Criminal law tends to put these elements secondary to the punishment of the offender., If you have any information that may help your child’s case, you should be sure to share this with your attorney as soon as possible. The attorney needs as much information as possible to best argue your child’s case. For example, if you know of witnesses that could support your child, you should inform the attorney immediately.   If your child has a learning disability or mental health problem, explain this carefully to the attorney.The resolution to a case will take into account these factors. Even if you think it’s not relevant, give your attorney the information, and discuss how to proceed with her.  One thing you can do which might help your child if the case continues and ends up in court, is to gather together documentation and reports that testify to your child’s character. Try to find records of your child’s achievements and certificates. Collect all his school report cards, and think about who to contact to ask for character reference letters. You could ask teachers, people from the local church, employers and neighbours.   Be careful about how you approach the character reference requests. You will have to be honest and explain what you need them for. You will often be asked to submit school report cards to court in any case. Do not take it upon yourself to write to a judge about your child, or submit any documents directly. Always consult with your attorney and follow her advice on what is appropriate and what isn’t., Your child will most likely be released on bail and you need to take the time to talk through everything with him. It might be painful and difficult, but it’s important that you confront the issue head on and try to work out a way forward together. How you react to the situation can have a big impact on how your child moves on. Try to talk as directly as possible about any underlying issues that may have contributed to criminal behaviour.   Say something like, "This is a serious situation, and I need you to explain to me how we got here." It’s important that he understands the seriousness of the situation. If your child finds it hard to talk to you about it, encourage him to talk to a trained counsellor. Sometimes people find it easier to explain their emotions and problems to a stranger., Being arrested is a difficult experience and your child will be feeling scared and uncertain, even if he doesn't appear to be. It's important that you find the right balance between ensuring he understands the seriousness of the situation and takes responsibility for his actions, and reassuring him that there is a way through this.   Explain that you will support him and help him to turn things around. Say something like, "You've messed up, but you can put it right and learn from the experience." Reassure him that you still love him, but explain how his actions are hurting you. If he comes to realise the impact of his actions on you, it might help him to change., It’s important that you take on your responsibilities as a parent and understand that non-custodial sentencing is to a significant extent reliant on the parents. You have to work together with your child to ensure that he sticks to whatever programme he has been assigned to. It could be a drugs treatment programme, a schedule of counselling appointments, or community service commitments.   All programmes will require active participation, and if he fails to attend he may be remanded in custody. Often the parent will be required to attend these programmes with her child, so it’s crucial that you work together to get through it.Try to think of it as a chance to correct mistakes before the consequences get too severe.  As well as working to correct any criminal behaviour and seeking help for any drug or alcohol related problems, it’s important that your child learns about his rights when arrested by the police. For whatever reason, your child may be arrested again. Acting calmly and with a full knowledge of how to react can make a big difference. A repeat offence is generally much more serious than a first offence.   Make sure your child understands that he must request to speak to a lawyer before speaking to the police.

 The most important thing is to pick heels a minimum of 3 inches, preferably 6. These will be the most flattering for your legs and stomach. If you really plan to wear these for stripping, look for shoes with plastic 1-piece soles and heels, as these will be most durable and forgiving. Sticking no-slip pads on the bottom is also a good idea.Don’t overstep yourself. If you’re not comfortable walking in heels, work your way up to them, rather than going straight to 6-inch heels. Use a blow drier to mold plastic shoes to the shape of your feet. Soften the plastic with the warm air, and slip the shoe on when it is pliable but not hot. Use your hands to gently mold it to your foot, and let it cool.Look for the most comfortable heels you can find. Heels are by nature not the most comfortable shoes in the world, but your feet will thank you if you keep comfort in mind as you shop.; , Many strippers purchase dancing bottoms designed specifically for that purpose, instead of normal underwear or bikini bottoms.If you are just dressing up for fun or fashion, though, a thong will work just fine.   Neon colors and lace are always good choices. Not many real strippers wear G-strings, because many state laws require a certain amount of skin to be covered. Of course, no one is going to call you on that if you’re just dressing up for fun.Erotic dancewear, which is more durable and flexible than underwear or bathing suit bottoms, can be purchased from websites like Spurst, BodyKandi, or Yandy. Incorporate your personal taste—wear what makes you feel sexy!  , There are lots of ways you can go with this, and as always, the most important part is to pick something that makes you feel hot. There are a number of other factors to consider, however.    Fit: The biggest priority is to pic something flattering. Tight-fitting things are great, as are low-cut tops, and short bottoms.  Color: Neon colors are always popular, and black or red can be very dramatic. You should of course take into consideration which colors look best with your skin tone and hair color. If you really plan on stripping in a club, avoid white. Most strip clubs have black lights, and white clothing can be problematic.Fabric: Distressed denim is a classic, whether you’re wearing Daisy Dukes or a denim miniskirt. Jersey, lycra, or other fabrics that allow you to move without restriction will make dancing easier. You might also consider wearing something see-through.  Style: Dresses are the most natural choice, as they are easiest to remove quickly. You might also consider wearing a low-cut shirt with a miniskirt, leggings and a crop top, shorts and a bikini top, or a leotard with a garter belt and garters, if you’re looking for a more burlesque look., Many genuine strippers don’t wear much in the way of jewelry, as it tends to get in the way or create a distraction. There are some options to consider, however.   Piercings can be fun, as long as they don’t get in the way. Consider getting one in your navel or nose. Studs or very small hoops will be the least likely to get caught on things. Glitter adds sparkle to you look without adding clunky jewelry.Hair extensions will let you flip your hair around in a sexy way.A garter belt can give you that old-school pinup girl look. A collar or leather choker could be a good choice if you are going for a kinky, bondage vibe. Fishnet stockings are a sexy classic.  Of course, there is no one way strippers make themselves up, and the most important thing is to find a style that makes you feel sexy. There are thousands of makeup tutorial videos available to watch online if you want to improve your makeup game.If you’re already a makeup pro, there are some simple ideas to consider.Dark, smoky eyeshadow Cat eyes Thick mascara, or fake eyelashesThin, highly arched, penciled eyebrows Glossy lips Liberal layers of foundation and concealer to hide any flaws in your skin (consider applying these to your body as well as your face—one thing that sets strippers’ beauty routine apart from that of other women is the extent to which they apply makeup to their bodies)

 This is the button between the controller's analog sticks; pressing it opens the PlayStation menu.  This will open your Settings.  Use the left analog stick to scroll and the X button to select.  This is near the "System Software Update" option., You'll find this close to the top of the Network menu., Your options include the following:  "Use Wi-Fi" - select this if your console is connected to the internet via wireless. If you're on a wifi network, you'll have to select the network you want to set up at this point. "Use a Local Area Network (LAN) Cable" - select this if your console is connected to your modem via an Ethernet cable.  This will allow you to manually change your DNS or MTU settings., This will take care of the more complicated procedures for you., This will bypass another manual setup option. You are now ready to change your DNS settings!, This option comes directly after the "Do Not Specify" one; it will allow you to edit your DNS IP addresses., In this case, you'll need to enter both a primary and a secondary IP address for your target DNS location. Popular DNS alternatives include the following options:Google - 8.8.8.8 ("Primary" field); 8.8.4.4 ("Secondary" field). OpenDNS - 208.67.222.222 ("Primary" field); 208.67.220.220 ("Secondary" field). Double-check your typing's accuracy before continuing.  From here, you'll need to change your PS4's max transmission unit (MTU) settings., This step comes directly after selecting "Next" post-DNS setup; the Manual option begins the MTU setup process., You can enter a new MTU value here., "1473" is the official value proposed by PlayStation.  You can also input "1450" if "1473" fails.  This will take you to the diagnostic test., If the test is successful, you've successfully changed your MTU settings!, This will take you back to the home screen., After altering the DNS and MTU settings, you should see an increase in your PS4's download speed!, The problem may be with your internet service, not the console itself; for example, if you aren't approved for download speeds above 10 megabytes per second, your downloads will routinely take a long time to complete.  Upgrading your plan or switching to a better Internet Service Provider may fix this problem.  Cheap modems tend to distribute limited amounts of bandwidth; just because you're paying for a certain amount of megabytes per second for your download speed doesn't mean you're getting it. If your modem supports less bandwidth than your internet service allows, consider upgrading to a better modem., If you're trying to download something on the same network as another device--be it computer, phone, or console--your download speed will slow down as a result.  To solve this problem, try downloading when there's no one else in the house and no extra devices on your network.  While the PS4 has a competent wireless internet suite, plugging your console directly into your modem will always increase your internet connection speed. You'll need an Ethernet cable to do so.  One end of your Ethernet cable should plug into the square port in the back of your PS4 while the other plugs into a similar port marked "Internet" on your modem. Ethernet cable ends are interchangeable.  You'll be prompted to install this firmware automatically when you connect your PS4 to the internet.  As a general rule, you should always update your console as soon as possible to prevent issues such as slow download speeds.  This is the download equivalent of turning off your computer and then rebooting it. If your download is taking a long time to initiate or proceed, pausing and then resuming it may increase the download speed. 

press the playstation button on your controller.  select the "settings" menu.  select the "network" option.  select "set up internet connection".  select the appropriate network option.  select "custom".  select the "automatic" option.  select "do not specify".  select the "manual" option.  edit your dns settings.  select "next" at the bottom of the screen.  select "manual" for your mtu settings.  select the character entry field.  enter a custom mtu value.  select "next", then select "do not use".  select "next" to test your internet connection.  exit the playstation menu.  try downloading a file.  check the terms of your internet contract.  check the limitations of your modem.  make sure your wifi network isn't crowded.  use an ethernet connection.  update to the latest firmware.  pause and then resume your download. 

 You should pull the rack out enough so that you can easily place the fish on the pan but not so much that you remove the rack.  You may want to curl up the edges of the foil so that any juices don’t pour out onto the cooking pan and burn; this will also save you cleanup time. , Expect to cook the fish for about 5 to 7 minutes for every inch of thickness. However, check the fish often to prevent burning.  Let it sit and rest for about a minute before loosening it from the foil.  You’ll need to use the widest spatula that you own to ensure that the fish does not fall apart when you remove it from the pan. If you used fish with the skin on one side, you may find that you can separate the flesh from the skin easily with the spatula at this point. ,

 Compost needs nitrogen and carbon, as well as air and water, in order to function properly so try to make sure that there is an available balance of all four components in order to keep the pile working properly., Typical carbon-based ingredients for compost include straw, leaves, cardboard, and shredded newspapers.   However, gardeners should only add black and white or grey newsprint because colored sheets may contain potentially toxic chemicals.  Add some nitrogen-based fertilizer, such as blood meal or alfalfa pellets, to the compost pile from time to time to keep it working. This is especially helpful during cold periods. Nitrogen not only generates heat, it is part of a balanced diet for all microbes.   Gardeners can also add kitchen scraps, such as vegetable peels and coffee grounds, for a higher nitrogen content if the pile stops decomposing like it should.  Where possible, compost piles should be located in sunny places, as this will increase heat and speed up the decomposition process.  Start the composting process in the garage, basement or nearby shed and eliminate some trips to the compost bin. Cooler temperatures will reduce the usual unpleasant odors. Simply place the compost materials in a large bucket or small garbage can and take them out to the compost pile once a week or whenever the container gets full.   Layer kitchen scraps between layers of “browns” or paper products to help reduce odors.  Diseased plant parts, dog manure, cat manure, coal ashes, and black walnut leaves should all be kept out of the compost pile because each of these things are known to be harmful in their own fashion.   Meat and dairy products should also be kept out of the compost bin because they will certainly attract unwanted attention from neighborhood animals.  

make sure there is a balance of nitrogen, carbon, air and water in your compost pile.  add some carbon-based ingredients.  use a nitrogen-based fertilizer.  place your compost pile in a sunny location.  start your composting indoors.  know which ingredients you shouldn’t add to your compost.

 A healthy diet that includes sources of vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, omega 3 fatty acids and probiotics can help strengthen toddlers' immunity.   Limit sugar intake. Sugar and other sweeteners can actually suppress the immune system and may also lead to hyperactivity, compromising the toddler's sleep and nap schedule. Make sure to feed the toddler at least 5 2-tbsp. (29.7 ml) size servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Include fruits such as strawberries, cantaloupe, blueberries, grapefruit, oranges, guava, papaya and mango. Boost immunity with good vegetable choices including sweet potatoes, broccoli, carrots, squash, kale and spinach. These fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins and antioxidants and help increase white blood cell count and boost antibodies, as well as natural killer cells. Natural killer cells attack microbes and cancer producing cells. Add fish or fish oil to the toddler's diet. Fish is a source of omega 3 fatty acids, which increase macrophage activity. Macrophages are white cells that eat bacteria in the body. Serve cold water fish varieties such as salmon, as these provide the greatest amount of omega 3. You can feed a toddler up to 3 3-oz. (85 g) servings per week, or you can mix the oil from 1 fish oil capsule into the toddler's food per day. Serve foods containing probiotics. Probiotics are healthy bacteria found in the gut. Toddlers who eat probiotic foods like yogurt may have increased immunity to rotavirus and urinary tract infections.; , Attend well child pediatrician appointments for the toddler. Your pediatrician will have a schedule for administering each recommended vaccine at the appropriate age and frequency. Vaccines provide immunity to many serious childhood illnesses.   Make sure your toddler gets a yearly flu shot in addition to the standard vaccines.  Toddlers need 12 to 13 hours of sleep per day. Sleep is necessary for a healthy immune system. Sleep deprivation can decrease the number of natural killer cells in the body and make a person more susceptible to illness.   Schedule morning or afternoon naps into the toddler's daily routine. Discuss sleeping problems with your pediatrician if your toddler has trouble sleeping. Your pediatrician should be able to provide suggestions for resolving sleep issues.  Exercise can help increase a person's number of natural killer cells and is an important part of overall good health.   Organize family exercise time in addition to solitary play. Good activities include hiking, a biking outing with the toddler on a tricycle, and any outdoor games such as kick ball or wiffle ball.  Children who are regularly exposed to secondhand smoke are at greater risk for bronchitis, ear infections, asthma and other respiratory conditions. Small children breathe at a faster rate and inhale more of the toxins than an adult, so even limited exposure to secondhand smoke can be more harmful than for adults.   Encourage all caregivers to quit smoking or cease smoking around the toddler. Request that any visitors or family members who will not quit smoking only smoke outside, well away from the toddler.  

evaluate the toddler's diet.  keep the toddler's vaccinations up to date.  ensure the toddler gets adequate sleep.  schedule time for exercise.  reduce exposure to secondhand smoke. 

; , Grip the skin near the bone and gently peel it toward the top of the drumstick. Don't pull it off entirely; just peel it back, so you can tuck butter and seasonings underneath. Turkey drumsticks are much larger than chicken drumsticks, so you'll only need one per person (two at most). Recent studies have shown that rinsing poultry isn't necessary, and in fact disperses bacteria around the kitchen surfaces. No need to rinse your turkey after removing it from the packaging.  This will keep the meat moist while the drumsticks bake. For larger drumsticks, you can use up to three tablespoons of butter.   To make the butter easier to spread, bring it to room temperature before applying it to the turkey. Use olive oil in place of butter if you're calorie conscious.  With the skin still pulled down, sprinkle salt and pepper all over the turkey legs. For more flavor, try rubbing a tablespoon of chopped herbs onto the buttered turkey meat while the skins are still pulled back. Rosemary, thyme and sage make great seasonings for turkey.  Stretch the skin back over the meat and rub another tablespoon (or up to three) of butter over the skin of the turkey. This will help the skin crisp up as it bakes.  Use a liberal amount of both salt and pepper to bring out the best in the turkey's flavor.  Use a pan large enough to easily hold all of the legs with no overlap. If you want to catch the drippings, use a metal roasting rack over a drip pan.  Place them in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Turn them over and cook for another 45 minutes. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the meat. They are ready when the internal temperature reaches 180ºF/82ºC.   To ensure that the turkey stays juicy, you can baste it every 20 minutes with a turkey baster or spoon. Use the drippings as your basting liquid, or baste with extra melted butter. Larger drumsticks may take a total of two hours to finish cooking.  This gives the juices time to reabsorb into the flesh, making the meat juicy. Serve whole or remove the meat from the bone.  

preheat the oven to 350ºf/175ºc.  peel back the skin.  rub a tablespoon of butter over the meat of each drumstick.  season the turkey.  pull the skin over the meat and rub it with butter.  sprinkle the skin with salt and pepper.  lay the turkey legs in a roasting pan.  bake the turkey drumsticks.  let the meat rest for fifteen minutes before serving. 

 Although Slashers are reasonably easy to kill on their own, they usually travel in groups of two or more, so keeping your distance is key. Select a medium to long-range weapon such as the plasma cutter to increase your chance of killing the Slasher before it reaches you. They will overwhelm you in numbers.; , Remember, shooting the Slasher's body is useless, so you need to aim for their limbs. The most effective combination to take them down is to aim for their legs initially as they are a large target. If this doesn't kill them, it will drop them to the ground, where you can then aim for either their arms or head if you are a good aim or curb stomp them. Use melee only as a last resort,  , Slashers are reasonably easy to fight off with the melee, especially if you're only facing one. They will usually take about 3-6 hits to kill. Because of their larger size, they are one of the only Necromorphs you can melee effectively, so if you are trying to unlock the Brawler achievement, then take advantage of them.  Especially if you are using the legs/arms combo, then using stasis on a Slasher will give you the time you need to implement this. This is particularly effective when you are facing a large group of Necromorphs or Slashers and you need to lower their numbers. If you can, use the stasis cheat.  If they manage to hook onto you and bite into your neck, then press A repeatedly to push them off. Unlike other Necromorphs, this will not kill them, so you will still need to finish them off, either with a melee or shot. If you can push them off into a Gravity Panel, the it will also help you get your Ragdoll Check achievement.  

keep your distance.  know where to aim for.  melee them.  use stasis.  fight them off.

 The clothing for this costume must be all black. The black clothing will give the allusion that there’s nothing behind the glow sticks (creating the appearance of a genuine stick figure), and the glow sticks will appear to glow brighter with the contrasting black background. Lay the top and bottoms on a flat surface such as a floor or table.The type of clothing used for the costume can be anything black, such as leggings, sweat pants, hoodies, turtlenecks, etc.; , On a sheet of paper, draw a couple different styles of stick figures to brainstorm what kind a pattern you want to create for your costume.Stick figure patterns are relatively simple in nature, but by sketching out a rough plan for your costume, you’ll have a better idea on how to position the glow sticks and how many glow sticks you’ll need. Err on the side of caution and get more glow sticks than you think you may need. Aim for approximately 50 glow sticks for both the back and front of the costume. This will be beneficiary if any of the glow sticks break, don’t glow, or if you want to make more patterns.  While the costume clothing is laid flat, assemble the glow sticks on top of the clothing to make the stick figure pattern. Generally, a straight line of glow sticks span from the neck area of the clothing, to the waist of the pants. Then, glow sticks lead off on both the top and bottom ends of the middle section of sticks, to create the arms and legs of the stick figure. When your glow sticks are in the pattern you want for the costume, use clear packaging tape to secure the glow sticks to the clothing.Stick the tape on the glow sticks lengthwise, so the entire glow stick is covered in tape. Do not crack the glow sticks at this time.   When the front of the costume is finished, turn the clothing over and tape glow sticks on to the back of the clothing.Try to have all of the glow stick ends touching each other in the pattern. This arrangement will help make the stick figure look like it is made of one continuous line rather than a bunch of dashed lines.  If you decide to wear a black hoodie for the top portion of the costume, consider decorating the rim of the hood with glow sticks in order to make a “head” for the stick figure. If you aren’t wearing a hoodie or don’t want to assemble the glow sticks that way, use the plastic connector pieces of the glow sticks to create a circled necklace of sticks. Then, consider taping the circle to your forehead, or using sturdy hair clips to attach the circle onto the hair on your head.Remember, you want to make a head for the back of the costume too. If you’re wearing a hoodie, you can tape the top of the circle necklace to the back of the hood. If you aren’t wearing a hoodie, use clips to attach the circle to your hair at the top of the back of your head. If you clip the circle onto your hair, the circle will be around your face with a little bit of your actual face poking through the hole of the circle.  When you’re ready to wear the costume, bend all the glow sticks to crack the inside that starts the glow in the dark chemical reaction. Try not to undo any of the taping as you bend the glow sticks.   The glow sticks tend to only glow for about six hours, so crack them as late as possible so the glow lasts throughout the night. 

lay out the costume clothing.  create a draft of stick figure pattern.  attach the glow sticks.  create the head of the costume.  crack the glow sticks. 

 As before, you'll need to decide what colors you want for your bracelet. You can choose lots of different colors or just a few different colors. You'll need them in the specific loom rubber bands. You'll also need something to serve as your loom. Two pencils work the best, but you can also use your fingers. You'll also need a C or S clip to connect your bracelet together.If you use pencils, which will give you the closest thing to an actual loom, try to use dull or unsharpened ones. With sharpened pencils you risk stabbing yourself as you move the rubber bands over the looms. If you find it too difficult to hold the pencils, you can try using your fingers. However, using your fingers might be a bit uncomfortable and it may be easier for the bands to slide off.  Take your first rubber band and twist it into an eight. Then place one loop of the eight on the right pencil and the other loop on the left.You can use double the rubber bands to create a thicker bracelet. Instead of placing just one rubber band on your pencils, you can twist two or three rubber bands into a figure eight and place them on your pencils.  As you did in the previous method, pick your next two rubber bands and place them one by one on top of your other rubber band. You will loop them around both pencils by stretching them across the outside of one pencil to the outside of the other. For a thicker bracelet, you can place three rubber bands instead of two., Using your fingers, grab the bottom rubber band, or rubber bands, and bring it (or them) up and over the top rubber bands you just placed. Take the right rubber band first, bringing it up and over the rubber bands and the top of the pencil. Then repeat on the left side.Tug on the rubber bands to readjust them and push them down lower on your pencils to keep working.  Take your next color or colors and place one or two rubber bands on your pencils (depending on how thick you want your bracelet to be). Then, bring the bottom rubber band over the top rubber band you just placed as you did in the previous step.If you are doing the simple method, using only one rubber band instead of sets of rubber bands, you should just see two loops on your pencils. Bring the bottom loop up and over the top loop on each of your pencils. If you are using multiple rubber bands to create a thicker bracelet, just make sure you are still bringing the bottom rubber bands over the top rubber bands. You should see a separation in the rubber bands by the middle loops.  Continue to repeat this process until you have your desired length. Then, attach the S or C clamp to the bottom of your chain, looping the hook through the rubber band loops., Take the rubber bands that are still wrapped around your pencils and gently pull them off, making sure you don't lose any of them. You can hold the middle rubber band loop, or you can grip the two side loops., Taking the two loops you just pulled off, stick one loop through the other loop. Then, pull the loop you just stuck through tightly, letting go of the other loop. This should create a nice knot at the end of your chain with one loop. Finally, connect that last loop to the S or C clamp and then you should have your finished bracelet! 

gather your supplies.  create a figure eight with your first band.  place two rubber bands over the first rubber band.  bring the bottom rubber band over the top.  place the next set of rubber bands on your pencils.  reach your desired length.  pull the rubber bands off your pencils.  tie off your rubber bands and create your bracelet. 

 Select a stockpot with a 6-quart (6-liter) capacity or more. The leaves should only reach the mid-point of the pot and should not rise much higher.  Fill the stockpot with enough water to just cover the leaves. Make sure that there is at least 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 centimeters) of empty space in between the top of the water and the top rim of the pot to prevent the water from boiling over.  Use around 1 to 2 teaspoons (4.8 to 9.5 grams) of salt. You want just enough salt to draw out the flavor of the spinach, but not so much salt that it dominates over the taste of the spinach.  Once it begins to steam, start timing it. Boil the spinach for 3 to 5 minutes.  Shake the drainer to remove any excess water.  Allow it to sit in the ice water for 30 seconds to 1 minute. The ice water "shocks" the spinach, preventing it from losing its bright green color.  Pour the contents of the second pot into a large pasta drainer and shake out excess water.         

place the spinach in a medium stockpot.  cover the leaves with water.  salt the water to taste.  boil the spinach in the water on the stove over high heat.  drain the spinach by pouring the contents of the pot into a large pasta drainer.  immediately transfer the spinach over to a separate stockpot filled with ice water.  drain the spinach once more. 

 You should be able to ask these questions, either to someone you know or to a stranger, and accept "no" for an answer. Write requests that you are likely to be turned down for, so that you can win more quickly. Here are some examples:   A good discount on purchases of services or products Sell something to them for a rather high price Play a sports game in a stranger's yard Take a picture with a person (for no reason) Piece of chewing gum Ride in their car Get a date Phone number; , Ask for something that you expect to be turned down for, because if the answer is "yes," it doesn't count. In order to win the 30-Day Challenge, you must experience at least 1 rejection per day for 30 days.If someone says yes, it means you haven't won yet! Grab another card or find a different person to ask. If someone says no, you won! Nod graciously, accept the answer, and walk away in triumph.  Be conscious of the other person's boundaries, and make it clear that this is a casual request (with no pressure).   Keep all your requests and comments respectful of the other person's body. Don't say anything sexual or rude about their appearance. Take no for an answer. If the person says no, say "okay," shrug your shoulders, and walk away. Recognize that some people have a very strong sense of stranger danger (particularly more vulnerable groups, such as women and disabled people). If the person seems too uncomfortable, apologize and leave.  Try holding a practice session by explaining the game to a family member, and having them reject a request. Then move on to the request that feels least stressful to you (for example, maybe you want to ask your dad to let you sit shotgun today).  This may be difficult if you are usually afraid of rejection. Give yourself a little extra pampering and remind yourself that it's okay. It will get easier with practice. As you improve, you will begin to get used to strange looks, rude comments from grumpy people, and outright dismissal of everything you’re "trying" to achieve.  Rejection therapy can help you become braver and more emotionally resilient, because you will become better able to handle a "no." The official website defines the "Five Objectives of The Rejection Therapy Game" as:Be more aware of how irrational social fears control and restrict our lives Smash the tyranny of fear and reap the treasures (treasures include wealth, relationships and self-confidence) Learn from, and even enjoy each and every new rejection Do not be attached to outcomes, especially when it involves the free agency of other people Permit yourself to fail  , Use and reuse your questions, on different people, one by one. Watch yourself become a stronger, braver person. By hearing enough "nos," you'll learn to make more requests about things that actually matter to you, which will sooner or later lead to hearing "yes."  

write requests on index cards.  grab a card and try to get rejected.  be considerate and polite with your requests.  start small.  cope with the no.  recognize what you have to gain.  keep practicing. 

   If you want to mix colors, experiment. You might even add wearable glitter, for a sparkly look.  This is done by twisting it until it falls out.   The chapstick will help emulsify the blush, combining the oils and ingredients to make it creamy.  Use a fork or similar item to mash the chapstick into a creamy consistency and to distribute the color through it.   Use a hairdryer to help melt the chapstick, turned to the high setting. If the blush hardens again as you're making it, use the hairdryer to melt it again. If the color seems too bright, tone it down with some tinted moisturizer.  Let it cool for a minute. Transfer to the refrigerator and leave it to set for about 10 minutes.  The blush is now ready to use. Apply using either your fingers or a makeup brush.  

crush the eyeshadow into powdery form.  push the chapstick out of its tube.  add the chapstick wax and eyeshadow powder to the mixing bowl.  pour the liquid mixture into the container.  done. 

 The butterfly kick is a rotating movement, so during the kick your head will be facing the opposite direction from your legs.   Work out which direction you want your kick to land and then begin by facing that direction. Also work out if you want to travel from left to right, or right to left. In the explanation that follows, we will be traveling from right to left.; , This stance, which is sometimes called forward stance, is the correct starting position for your kick.Place your legs slightly wider than hip width apart. Place both feet at 45 degrees angles, as if at 2 o'clock on a clock face. Get into a lunging position. Your back leg should be straight and your front leg bent at a 90 degree angle. Turn your hips in the direction of your front leg., Placing your arms in the right starting position will allow you to build momentum for your rotation.   While in bow stance, stretch the arm that corresponds to your straight leg in front of you with the shoulder by your ear. The arm that corresponds to your bent leg should be pointed behind you, with your upper arm close to the side of your torso.Your hands should be flat with the fingers stretching away from your body in both directions.  Footwork is important to execute the butterfly kick, here's how to get the footwork right.   Starting from the bow position, pivot both feet 90 degrees. Do this by staying on the balls of your feet and lifting your heels off the ground. Shift your weight to the leg that was previously straight in the bow position. If you are traveling from right to left, you will therefore pivot your feet so that the toes point 45 degrees to the left. Bend the left leg and transfer most of your weight to it.  During the rotating movement, whip your arms as if drawing semi-circles in the air.For example, the arm that was initially up by your ear in the starting position (in this case, the right arm), should end up stretched out behind you with the hand pointing down to the ground. Similarly, you should swing the arm that was initially stretched out behind you (in this case, the left arm) upwards. It should to come to rest by your left ear. These arm movements give you vital momentum to take off with your kick. The direction is less important than maintaining good extension away from your body with the arms.  As you are pivoting your feet and bending the left leg, bend your body forward, hinging at the hips so that your chest is parallel to the floor.Make sure to keep your back straight as you bend forward. Maintaining a straight back gives the butterfly kick its distinctive look.  As you began to pivot, you have transferred your weight to your left leg, which was initially the straight leg in bow stance.   Keep pivoting until you execute a full 180 degree turn. At this point your head will be facing the back wall or the opposite direction that you were facing when you began your jump.  As you are pivoting with the left foot, kick your right leg out behind you.  When you are mid-kick, all parts of the body are off the floor and your limbs are extended out from your body in a dynamic motion.  Your left leg will come down after the right. Bend the landing leg and straighten the left leg and you will find you are in the same bow stance that you started in.  As you are kicking, point the toes of both feet and extend your legs as much as possible. This will make your kick more aesthetically pleasing.  When you are rotating make sure that your chest stays parallel to the floor and that your head looks up.   Fix your gaze on something ahead of you, this technique is called spotting. Imagine that you are locking eyes with your opponent.  This is a relatively simple move but it requires practice to build strength and accuracy. The more you practice the better, dedicate a few minutes per day and you will begin to notice improvement.   Get a qualified person to spot you when you are just beginning. They can help by holding your arm and pulling you through as you rotate.Practice with a wall bar to support your weight, to help you build up to the full kick. 

face the direction you want your kick to land.  begin in bow stance.  extend your arms out.  pivot your feet.  swing your arms for momentum.  bend you body forward.  pivot 180 degrees on your left (standing) leg.  lift your right leg up and extend it out behind you.  jump off your standing leg and kick it out behind you.  land on your right leg.  point your toes.  keep your head up.  practice. 

 This will save you time when you arrive at the park - you won't have to wait in any queues at the ticket offices!; , Try previewing each attraction or show on YouTube, or take a peek at the ride through photos from others. Learn from what others see. This can help decide which rides and attractions will take priority during your visit. , The address to SeaWorld is 500 Sea World Drive, San Diego, CAThe cost to park your car at the SeaWorld San Diego resort will run you about $16 for cars and upwards from there (depending on complexity of vehicle).  SeaWorld San Diego doesn't have "lands" in the way that some theme parks do, but it has many prominent attractions to help you navigate through the park.   Follow the park outline by taking a left and follow clockwise around the park.  If you'd like to touch sting rays and other aquatic animals, this is the place to go. This attraction was also built to commemorate SeaWorld's 50th Anniversary.  Get to know a lot more about his habit and a little more information about how powerful his fins really are.   Find out what times the Shamu show is showing on that particular day. It normally only has a few shows per day. Be careful of the Splash Zone at the Shamu zone. Sit back in the upper deck if you don't want to get super soaked. If you're game to get soaked, you can try out the bottom row of seats.  You'll be able to see dolphins and otters in these two little areas.  It's a wild ride, much like Grizzly Peak White Water Raft Ride at Disney's California Adventure park, Kali River Rapids at Disney's Animal Kingdom (Lake Buena Vista, FL), or Rio Loco at SeaWorld San Antonio.  Here you'll see a whole bunch of types of fishes in an aquarium-like setting.  Some of these are truly interesting, and highlight some really neat recycling projects. ,,, To get there from the Manta roller coaster, you need to take a left. It's a little ways up, but the ride is cool and relatively easy and can definitely take a load off of any tired feet that may exist.  If you've caught the Bat Ray feeding and have taken in SkyTower as well, you'll most likely have missed the Sea Lion's feeding. But if your timing is just right, you can catch them in the act!  , You can catch the Otter show here.  You'll learn a lot about the solitary life of a flamingo and its biome.   There are two places you can see flamingoes. The other one is to the one side of Animal connections near the Dippin Dot's Sundae Shop on the other side of the Arctic Plaza. (Arctic Plaza is a special events-only area across from Pets Stadium down a small pathway). , This Skyride is an out-and-back skyride that takes you out over the Bay and back around and back to the entrance house.  Look at how these clean fish and aquatic creatures live in such a secluded place.  Young children might be afraid of the sharks, but for most, this is an interesting stop.  It's definitely a less scary exhibit!  ,, You'll be able to see many different turtles up close.  Although the ride vehicles look like life-boats, and the center column has an aquatic feel and a blue painted floor, it's actually not a boat. If possible, take in at least one preview, as there are some differences between other Scrambler rides and this ride.  It is only open as a special events venue seating area.  Get a good glimpse of the habitat of a penguin. This exhibit is walk-through and is exactly like the former Penguin Encounter at SeaWorld Orlando.  This is one area that is not to be missed.  Much like Universal's Animal Actors at Universal Studios Hollywood, this show is super funny and a good time for all.  Ride the Journey to Atlantis log-flume for an out-of-this-world experience.  This building offers a walk-through exhibit, so no need to fear you'll be taken quickly through this - it's completely at your pace, and you can take your time.  It's official entrance is near Dolphin Treasures and directly across from Pinapple Pete's Island Eats and nearby Dolphin Stadium.   Take in SeaWorld's version of the teacup ride at Abby's Sea Star Spin in the Sesame Street Bay of Play area. Ride the hub-and-spoke ride styled to Elmo's world at Elmo's Flying Fish ride. Push the lever up to raise the fish high and release it down to descend downwards again. Ride the rather tame version of a pirate ship-like ride at Oscar's Rockin Eel ride.  

purchase your seaworld tickets online (or over the phone) before visiting the park, particularly if you are visiting from outside the us.  preview the attractions in the park before your visit.  pack water, snacks, money and most importantly your park tickets before you leave for the park that day!  ,  drive and park to the parking lot at seaworld sandiego.  look at the set up of seaworld san diego as you enter through the turnstiles.  take in the explorer's reef section of the park, just in front of you as you enter the park.  watch shamu (the icon of seaworld) at the shamu show (in one ocean) at shamu stadium here.  exit out of the stadium and head towards dolphin point and otter outlook (what you'll see in back of the shamu screen several yards away).  head towards shipwreck rapids, if you like whitewater rafting rides.  pass in back and over top aquaria: world of fishes exhibit.  look at some of the washed ashore sculptures.  take a right outside of the washed ashore sculptures and head towards manta and the bat ray feeding area, if skyrides don't thrill you.  ,  catch feeding time at the bat ray exhibit, if you find yourself there at the right time.  ,  ride the manta roller coaster.  ,  look at the park from the skytower.  pass by the sea lion feeding.  head up towards the sea lion and otter stadium.  watch the flamingoes at the flamingo exhibit just outside of the mission bay theater.  take in a few minutes of the theatrical performance (if one is showing) at the mission bay theater.  ,  ride the bayside skyride at this point.  take a look into the freshwater aquarium.  walk through the shark encounter exhibit.  take a look at the turtle reef just around the corner from the shark encounter.  watch the seaworld's dolphin show called dolphin days at dolphin stadium.  ,  check out the turtles in the turtle trek exhibit.  head towards riptide rescue, if you like "scrambler-like" rides.  skip the nautilus pavilion area unless you're attending a special event.  view the penguin encounter area of seaworld san diego.  see the polar bears up close in the wild arctic exhibit.  take in the funny show at pets stadium.  head down towards the journey into the atlantis area near the tip of the bottom of the park.  connect with several different types of animals at the animal connections building.  have your kids play with sesame street and the gang in the sesame street bay of play. 

 No person is ever perfect, but as the U.S. author John Steinbeck once said “Now that you don’t have to be perfect, you can be good.” Remind yourself that even Olympic gold medalists get points off on their scores (but still win). That Albert Einstein made (but learned from) his mistakes and imperfect solutions. Never let “perfect” undermine your self-esteem and become the enemy of all the excellent, worthwhile (but unfortunately imperfect) things you are capable of.   Striving for absolute “perfection” can be counterproductive, because it can diminish an accomplishment or task completion just because it is not flawless success. Perfectionism is also closely linked to depression, troubled relationships, and decreased life satisfaction.; , If you are unsure whether something you wish to do will upset your parents, ask first. If you are hesitant to ask, it is probably a good sign that it will upset your parents.   When asking, always ensure you've thought through the possible outcomes of what you are asking to do and anticipate the concerns your parents will have. Don't get upset. Although your parents may seem resistant to your suggestion, remember to stay cool-headed and present facts and examples that illustrate why you should do something and why you are capable of handling any outcomes. Especially if you are still living at home, if your parents say "no," always honor their wishes, even if it is not what you would prefer.  When you have promised parents you will do something, but wait until you have to be told again (and again), it can create negative tensions.   Set expectations early. Say “Mom, I have to finish before I’ll have time, but as soon as I am free, I will take care of this,” then complete all tasks before having to be asked additional times. Anticipate needs and fill them. Do you know what days garbage runs on? Are guest expected over the weekend? Take out the garbage, clean your room and other rooms in the house, all without being asked.  You may not initially agree with what your parents are saying, but remind yourself that they have your best interests at heart.   They have seen more of life than you have and may have insights that you are too young to have access to. Trust that they are looking out for you and don’t back talk. Back talk creates arguments and can be counterproductive to establishing yourself as respectful and trustworthy.  Demonstrate respect for yourself by caring for your body’s needs and maintaining a healthy appearance. Your parents love you and it reassures them to see you healthy and well-cared for.   Keep up with hygiene and cleanliness. Try to take a bath or shower daily. At the very least, wipe off sweat and grime with a soapy wash cloth. Wash hair every 1-3 days.Wear clean clothes and comb your hair. Iron clothes that need ironing. Wear a belt with pants, especially loose ones. Style hair to keep it out of your face. Eat regular, healthy meals. Three meals a day is traditionally recommended; however, nutritionists have indicated that 5-6 smaller meals spread over the day can actually be healthier for us and maintain a more even blood sugar. Regardless of which meal plan you choose, make sure you are eating enough to be healthy.Go to bed at a reasonable hour. Teens between the ages of 14 to 17 need 8-10 hours of sleep a night. Anyone over the age of 18 needs at somewhere between 7-9 hours.  Although we often want to show our parents how successful and capable we are, there are times when we may need help to reach our desired goals.   Don’t be too proud or egotistical to accept help from your parents, even in the form of advice. When you do take help, be humble and show gratitude for the contributions your parents make.  When we are young, the world is ours and we can let our ambitions guide what happens. But think about how difficult it can be for parents to adjust to rapid changes that we take for granted.   When you get married, get a job, move to a new place, it can remind them of their own mortality, or make them lonely for the days when you were just down the hall. Help parents adjust to your own evolution. Take time to talk with them and let them ask questions. Help them understand, but don’t be angry if they can’t always do it. Remind them that acceptance and trust are just as powerful as understanding.  Being true to you means that you are confident, happy, learning, and growing. Nothing makes a parent more content than seeing their child coming into their own and being successful. When you are true to you, you are actualizing the person your parents raised you to be. Sometimes, however, being true to you will initially create tension with parents.   For example, if you parents want you to attend church with them, but you are not religious, let them know that you wish not to go. If you still have to attend their church, consider how you can still be true to your values during the experience. Resources like the Skeptics Bible offer some great conversation starters to get people thinking about the contradictions and inconsistencies within religious scriptures.Are you worried about coming out to your parents? While your sexuality is an important part of who you are and should be celebrated, if you are living at home with your parents, you may not want to share this part of yourself at that time. If you are living away from home and worried about talking to your parents about your sexual orientation, consider speaking to a therapist about the best "coming out" options for your circumstances., Parents want more than anything from their daughter is that she grows up to have a safe and happy life. Part of having that life, however, is that your parents want to be a part of it and offer assistance that will help secure that happiness. They also want to share in your relationships, help raise possible grandchildren, and enjoy watching their family grow., Take the advantages, kindness, support, and generosity you’ve been shown by your parents and offer it to others. That could be your own children, your spouse, friends, and other family members.   Volunteer to be a “Big Sister,” who offers support and life guidance to at-risk young women.When you use what you’ve been given you help others, you show respect and gratitude for the upbringing your parents gave you.  When families grow and gain new members, it can require some adjustment, particularly for the new addition. Remember that your partner loves you for who you are, and that you should not try to be someone else. At the same time, look for opportunities to make connections to his or her family., Although every family does things differently, many families accept new members by immediately treating them as a new sibling or child.   If you are an only child and have never had siblings before, think of sibling relationships as being like living with a best friend for most of your life. Everyone tries to get along, have fun, and take care of each other, with lots of compromises. Accept that hugs, jokes, and some teasing may come along with being the new sibling, but that it is coming from a place of love and welcome. Reciprocate in turn when possible.  Especially if you have just married into a new family, be sure to plan for at least an hour a day of “Me” time during visits.   "Me" time may be when you say “I’m going to have a quick nap” and then rest for a few moment, thinking back over the events of the day, releasing any possible stress that may have built up. You can even ask you partner to join you, especially if there is something you are confused about any want to ask questions. Over time, as you and your partner's family become better acquainted, these quiet moments may not even be necessary.  The relationship between a parent and biological child can permit a degree of honesty unmatched by any other relationship. While your partner may be able to tell their parents anything, remember that they are getting to know you, and tact can be important maintaining peace.   Remember to never lie to your partner’s family, but also remember to break difficult truths with respect and kindness.  When we begin a relationship with a partner’s family, we usually want them to like us as much as possible. Yet, while compromise is important, it is equally as important not to sacrifice your entire personal comfort for someone else.   For example, are your partner’s parents asking you to come visit for the holidays when you both really want to stay home? If you and your partner agree, be kind, but firm, in letting the rest of the family know that you will be delighted to join them at a different time, but can’t make the requested date. This may cause disappointment at first but, in the long-run, establishes reasonable expectations and mutual respect.  There are points on which you will never agree with a partner’s family. This is not a sign of failure or incompatibility. Instead, think of it as a challenge, to love and be tolerant in spite of differences.   For example, do you already know that your partner’s parents have different politics than you? If anyone asks, say “You know, I’ve never been entirely comfortable talking about politics. Mind if I sit this one out and listen?” If pushed, gently remind others that you respect their beliefs and feelings, love them dearly, hope they can respect your feelings as well.  Compromise is a key part of maintaining healthy family relationships. This may mean accepting that your partner’s family has completely different holiday traditions, or that Aunt Margaret will always makes her macaroni and cheese for special occasions (even though that was what you always made).   While you should never give up all the habits and rituals that bring joy and meaning to your life, you may find that you need to adjust how and when you observe your own traditions. For example, if Aunt Margaret always makes the macaroni and cheese, ask your partner what kind of dish you could make that could become a family staple. Another compromise is to have your own Christmas tree and cookies for Santa at home but still enjoy lighting the menorah and having noodle kugel with your partner’s family.  Welcoming a new person to the family can be a joyous but also stressful occasion.   It can remind your in-laws that they are aging, or that their child/brother/sister lives far away, or that there may be limitations on how much family time that can be spent together, which can bring mixed feelings into play. While you should never be a door mat or accept disrespect, understand what families go through when a new person is added and attempt to give in-laws the benefit of the doubt before becoming upset or angry.  Think about your own personal life, as well as the relationship you share with family, including parents. What aspects could be made more comfortable, productive, or enjoyable? Below are exercises in mindfulness that can help you be a better daughter:   Strive for excellence in all tasks you undertake. When you complete tasks without a commitment to success or improvement, you show a lack of concern for the people impacted by the outcome. Instead, demonstrate love, care, and respect by attempting to complete all tasks successfully, pushing for above-average outcomes. Let your parents feel proud of what you have accomplished Look for new ways to make positive changes. This could be something as simple as planting flowers in your parent’s garden or deciding to ask your supervisor for a promotion at work. When you make a personal effort to bring happiness to yourself or the people who care about you, you demonstrate a commitment to being a better person for yourself and others., When long periods go without talking to your parents, it can be difficult to make the call when either party needs help or support. For this reason, try to reach out to your parents as often as is convenient and comfortable for both of you.   For younger adults, this could mean daily check-ins via text to a conversation over dinner. For adult children, try to text and/or call your parents multiple times a week. It doesn’t have to be an important message. It might be as simple as seeing your mom’s favorite flower and wanting to say “hi,” to sharing a funny observation from work.Reach out first. Don’t always be the one waiting on a phone call or text. Make time to talk to your parents and call them. Or if you live away from home, invite them to come visit. By reminding our parents of their importance to us, we cement bonds and offer reassurance.  When parents tell us to listen, it means more than just nodding while they talk. Demonstrate that you are not only engaged but learning through active listening. This is not just an act of respect. It also ensures that you remember what they’ve told you and can act on it appropriately. Below are tactics for active listening:Restate information: This demonstrates that you are attentive and also gives you the ability to clarify things you are less certain of. Offer subtle "encouragers": Nod your head. Say "uh huh" or "I see" so your parents continue speaking and elaborate on their ideas. Summarize: Before ending the conversation or asking questions, summarize information into your own words. This helps you remember what was said, but also allows for your parents to say “That one part is not quite right, let me explain again” in order to offer correction. Give feedback: If something strikes you as a good idea, say “I agree that this is good, because…” If you are less certain of another part, say “I’m less certain about this part. Can you explain it again?” This allows you to collaborate and even nuance the information. Depending on the situation, your parents might even welcome suggestions or alternative ideas. Probe for more information: when in doubt, ask questions to draw out elaboration, make distinctions, or clarify information. Make sure that you completely understand what you’ve been told and how will impact your behavior. Validation: Remind your parents that that you appreciate them taking the time to offer guidance and instruction. Give hugs, make a card, say “Thank you.” Always demonstrate your gratitude for and appreciation of your parents.  Although it can be tempting to remind our parents of mistakes they’ve made, unless it is key to your protection or health, resist the urge to dwell on the past.Forgive. Forgiveness is not a free pass. It doesn’t mean that mistakes that happened are ok or validated. But what it does mean is that you are willing to move on and love in spite of mistakes. That you accept your parents as human and, like you, not expected to be perfect. Repair disagreements quickly. The longer a disagreement remains unresolved, the longer resentment builds and the more difficult it can be to make amends. Additionally, when we don’t resolve lingering issues with those closest to us, we build a pattern of behavior that will continue into future relationships as well—even those with our own children. For these reasons, it is best to repair damaged relationships quickly and develop the conflict resolution skills required to be a better person, daughter, and mother.  

be realistic.  always ask first.  honor your responsibilities.  be respectful.  take care of yourself.  take help.  be patient with your parents.  be true to you.  have a happy life.  pay it forward.  balance individuality and closeness.  be open to new family relationships.  give yourself “me” time.  be honest.  set boundaries.  agree to disagree.  be open to change.  empathize.  be mindful.  communicate.  listen carefully.  stay in the present. 

 You want one that is affiliated with a national boxing organization and that also has a reputation for training fighters. If you are serious about this, do not go to a health club that happens to have boxing classes. You need a gym that's dedicated to boxing (and potentially other martial arts).   Odds are if you do a bit of asking around, you'll find the place that has the reputation as the best of the best in your area. There will likely be no doubt about it which club you'd like to join.; , He will explain their hours of operation, fees and methods of training. You can also find out his experience as a boxing coach and whether he was a fighter himself at one point. Meet the staff and get a feel for the place. If it fills you with a sense of excitement and anticipation, it's probably right for you.    Do ask questions. Find out what they would recommend for you and what kind of training you should start. What's their schedule like? Who would you work with? How can you meet everyone? Make sure you know what you're getting into before you sign up.  You want a club that has a wide range of clients at different levels. As you begin to develop your skills, you will want to start sparring with other people. A club with fighters at all different levels mean that there will always be someone for you to work with and that you can go grow with the club.   Think of it like walking into a restaurant: if there's no one there, you wouldn't eat there. And if there's only people in blue hats and you're not wearing a blue hat, you might not eat there. If there's only people who seem to be miserable, you probably wouldn't eat there. So take a look – do the clients seem A) fit and competent and B) happy with their training? If you can, find someone who doesn't work there about the establishment. Sometimes you need an unbiased party to get an honest opinion.  Before you start working with a coach, it's probably a good idea to know at least the 101 of boxing and some of the terminology. You don't have to be good at it, you should just know a little of what your club peers are talking about. Here's a few starters:Jab. This is the busiest punch in boxing. It's a simple punch thrown to your opponent's chin with your leading hand (the hand of the forward foot).  Cross. This punch is thrown with your dominant hand. It is a power punch. It involves a slight rotation of your torso, simulating a horizontal moment across your plane.  Uppercut. This punch ends up in your opponent's chin or solar plexus. It's thrown at close range and can be quite the cincher.  Hook. This is a short sideways punch delivered with your elbow out and to the side so your arm forms a hook.  Southpaw. This is a left-handed fighter (either naturally or converted). To a "normal" fighter, they do everything in reverse. Because of their stance differences, they practically fight on top of each other.  Outside and inside fighters. An outside fighter likes to keep his distance, stepping in for the jab. An inside fighter stays close, preferring moves like the uppercut.  Your instructor will show you the basic boxing moves like jabs, uppercuts and hooks and instead of just knowing the terminology, you'll be getting good at it. You will also be given pointers in footwork, positioning and defense moves.   A good trainer will also work on your secondary skills, like endurance and agility. When he sends you running around the block, it's for good reason. And don't expect to be sparring just yet – he'll let you know when you're there.  The number of ways a boxer can better his or her body is endless. A good program will include heavy and speed bag punching, circuit training and jumping rope. You should be training outside of the ring several times per week at a minimum.   You should be doing cardio and weight training, in addition to brushing up secondary skills with dance, yoga, interval training, and core exercises. That being said, have a day or so a week where you take it a bit easier – you don't want to wear your body out without even getting into a fight.  These workouts should last 90 minutes and be done three to four times per week. A good boxing based workout would be 20 minutes of sit-ups and push-ups, 20 minutes on a stationary bike and then 30 minutes of jogging. The session could finish with 10 minutes of jump roping and 10 minutes of sparring with a punching bag or, if possible, another person.   A 3-mile run shouldn't really be a problem for you. Combine it with jumping rope, jumping jacks, sit-ups, push-ups, and bag work. See how long you last before you tire yourself out and your technique starts failing.  You should be doing 20-30 minutes of dynamic stretching (rotating joints, working out any particularly stiff spots, no stretches held for a long time) before a workout and/or sparring. After any workouts spend a considerable amount of time doing some long static stretches (stretches that are held for a long time). This helps prevent injuries and reduce muscle stiffness.   You may laugh, but taking up yoga isn't a bad idea. It'll help with your muscle tone, flexibility and reach, and get your entire body loosened up and ready for anything. That's not to mention the peace of mind and focus it can grant, too., All professional boxers follow some sort of diet or nutrition program. Working out means nothing if you aren't eating well. What's more, if you eat poorly, your performance won't be top notch. Your body is your moneymaker in this situation.   What's a boxer's diet? It's high in healthy proteins – namely chicken, fish (like salmon and tuna), eggs, peanut butter and fruits and vegetables. It also includes sources of healthy fats, like olive oil, avocado, and nuts.Your body needs a balance of nutrients, fat included, to make it through all the work you're forcing it under.  You may think this means cardiovascular endurance, and it does, but it also means two other types of endurance:Leg endurance. To be a great boxer, your legs are constantly moving. Sometimes in teeny, tiny moments, which can be even more difficult to make. After rounds and rounds of fighting, your legs will feel like cement. You can prolong your leg endurance by doing activities like jumping rope.  Shoulder endurance. When your shoulders are tired, say goodbye to your punches and your defense. You won't even be able to hold your hands in front of your face when your shoulders are down for the count. So work on that speed-bag and do arm endurance drills consistently.  Boxing isn't just about boxing. Sure, that's the brunt of it, but you need other skills to make you well-rounded and ready for the future. Don't laugh just yet – consider a few of these ideas:Take a dance class or two. Plenty of athletes, not just boxers, take dance classes. Why? Dance is all about balance, agility, and flexibility – three very important skills in sports. Take an acting class. You want to do promotions, commercials, and get sponsorships, right? You also don't want to look like an idiot doing them. So brush up on your skills in the spotlight to emphasize your charm. Study business or sports management. This is good for two reasons: A) you don't want to pull a Mike Tyson and blow all your money nor do you want to be taken advantage of by people who say "they deserve a cut" and B) you want a future. Your body won't be able to box forever, so having a more practical but related background can help you transition into coaching or promoting.  This can be solved by doing a quick search on the Internet or by talking to all your connections at your boxing club. When you're ready, your coach will likely let you know. You'll likely know, too.   This step is more paperwork than anything. Visit USAboxing.org (if you're based in the US, of course) to get a list of information by state. Once you do this, you'll be able to find open events that you can participate in.  You will do this by filling out an application and undergoing a physical examination from your doctor. This is done at the state level through the State Athletic Commission when it comes to the US.You will have to contact the necessary people to get your license to compete in events. There is a minimal fee and it varies by state. Other than that, it's just a bunch of forms and a physical assessment., These events are the way most fighters get their initial experience. The fights don't count towards your record, but are the safest and most practical way of getting experience. You'll be able to find them through connections and through your organization's website, which should post upcoming events.   You'll be classed by age, weight, and record initially. You can be an amateur boxer in the US at just 8 years old!, The difference between amateur and pro boxing is that you will be allowed to wear protective headgear. This is essential in the beginning stages of your fighting career in order to prevent potentially fatal injuries while you learn to protect yourself.   Again, you will be placed according to your weight, age group and class, which will begin as "novice" if you're 17 or older. You'll start out in local and regional tournaments, with a long-term goal of competing in the U.S. Amateur Championships and earning a spot on the U.S. Boxing team.  Some coaches are pretty sketchy. They'll encourage to fill a slot in a weight class just so you can get going and they can start profiting off of you. Don't do this – sometimes it's just not healthy and your body will take to injury much more easily.Only compete where you feel comfortable, not where your coach says you should go.   Think about where your weight normally stays around (provided it's consistent and you're fit, of course). You may be able to compete at about 5 pounds more or less than that, but anything greater will likely put strain on your body and be unhealthy.  You're going to be facing really, really talented individuals. You think you're fit now, but you'd be surprised the strides your body can make, especially when it comes to endurance. At this level, here's what you should be capable of:Running 3–5 miles (4.8–8.0 km) without getting too tired Jumping rope for 30 minutes straight Hitting the heavy bag for 15 minutes non-stop Being able to spar with any amateur from any gym (not including pro-level amateurs with over 100 fights) Sparring double the required rounds (amateur boxing is 3 rounds)  , Let's cover these four things separately:    Defense. You'll be looking at anywhere from 60-150 punches per round. It doesn't matter how powerful your own punches are – you've gotta have that shoulder endurance and keep your defenses up and going at 100% at all times.  Speed. You're fighting against opponents that are the speediest you've ever fought. It doesn't matter how powerful you are – if you can't get a punch in because you're too slow, you won't be getting anywhere.  Power. This comes from good technique. Sure, throwing wild punches will catch your competition eventually, but you'll just wear yourself out. You've got to be able to concentrate your power and control it. Waste it and you've lost the match.  Autonomy. By now, you need to be on autopilot. You don't have time to be thinking, "Okay...now I should do a left uppercut...keep your hands up, kid...oh, time to duck," that sort of thing. Every move needs to be a gut reaction.  Your manager will have connections to boxing matchmakers who will set you up with fights. You will now be earning money, but keep in mind that at least 20% of your pay will go to the manager and the matchmaker. That being said, it's worth it – they're the ones working on beefing up your reputation.   By now, you're probably pretty immersed in the boxing community. You'll know which managers are in your area and which ones are legitimate. If you have talent, they'll probably want to take you on. Just make sure it's someone you get along with and can trust.  The biggest of the biggest boxers out there drive fancy cars, rake in the millions, and maybe only fight a few times a year. Then there's a middle tier that can score some airtime on TV and can make a quick couple of thousands of dollars. But then there's everyone else. You won't be bathing in gold coins for a while, so keep your day job for now.It's kind of like Hollywood – you don't realize how many people are struggling to make it big. This is normal to start out. And keep in mind that up to 50% of your wages are going to the people below you, like your promoter or manager. Keep your income steady by having at least a part-time gig on the side.  You will have to join a professional boxing association (IBF, WBC, WBO, or WBA) and get a boxer's license from the boxing commission you will be fighting in. There's a term for this called "alphabet soup." It's been coined because it seems like association after association is springing up like wildfire. If you don't like the sound of one, there's a dozen others you can consider.   In the US, again, this is done at the state level. Each state has different requirements, ranging from experience as an amateur to having a manager. At the very least, have your birth certificate and social security card at the ready – there will be plenty of paperwork.  Your ultimate goal should be to win a championship belt. If you can hold belts in three out of the four associations, you will be classified as a "Super Champion." Holding all four belts makes you the "Undisputed Champion."   This takes time and diligence, in addition to withstanding injury and defeat. Your skin will have to be thick in more ways than one. Boxing has a way of weeding out the weak of body and the weak of mind.  The media has a way of glorifying specific types of people. The most famous boxers are the ones that were charismatic and ate up the camera, like Jack Dempsey. But if you dig a little deeper, there's no real stereotype boxers fit into, apart from the fact that very few aren't exactly average.   Keep in mind that talent and accomplishment don't necessarily mean glory. Gene Tunney outboxed Jack Dempsey twice, but his self-contained demeanor kept him from living in the limelight, unlike his gregarious, extroverted opponent. Boxers aren't all looking for fame.Take a cue from them that boxers come from all walks of life. Need inspiration that you can do it all? Turn to Calvin Brock, the "boxing banker." He was a well-educated man with a legitimate career in banking when he turned pro.If you're already in college, don't sweat it. It's doable. On the other hand, you're never too young, either. Juan “Baby Bull” Diaz went pro at sixteen.Sure, he didn't last long, but he still did it. Now he has a law degree and is still doing well for himself. Whichever road you take, you'll likely be fine.  

choose a boxing club to join.  talk to a trainer.  check their membership.  familiarize yourself with the basics.  start working with your coach.  start a complete physical training regimen.  start some pretty intense workouts.  remember to stretch.  begin your athlete's diet.  work on your endurance.  train your mind, too.  find your local amateur boxing organization.  register as an amateur boxer.  participate in unsanctioned boxing events.  begin your amateur boxing career.  don't just fill a vacant slot in a weight class.  get even more fit.  up your defense, speed, power, and sense of autonomy.  find a manager.  don't quit your day job just yet.  get licensed.  climb up the ranks.  look to the pros for inspiration. 

 Place the rice, water, and spices together in a pot. Use a spoon to stir the ingredients together well. Cover the pot.  Place the pot over medium high heat. Bring the contents to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Continue cooking the rice until it has absorbed the water.          Check the rice to make sure it doesn't get too dry. Add more water if it looks like it's beginning to dry out. For extra flavor, you can add a little vegetable or chicken stock instead of water.  Remove it from heat and use a few forks to fluff it up. Transfer it to a serving dish and serve with lamb, beef, chicken or a vegetarian dish. 

add all of the ingredients to a large pot.  cook the rice.  finish the rice.  finished.  

 Observe what you're doing in the mirror to help you see what is happening as you tie the knot. You won't need the mirror once you've got the hang of the tying but initially it helps with getting the tie length correct, etc. Check that your shirt is buttoned to the top and stand the collar up before proceeding.       ; , One end of the tie should be considerably wider than the other (the general rule is that the wide end hangs twice as low as the narrow end). Place the wider end on the right, and about a foot (30cm) lower than the narrower side on the left.          If you are left handed, it's recommended that you switch the sides of the wide and narrow ends, as it is easiest for the dominant hand to work with the longest end. If so, reverse the instructions as you go!  , Create somewhat of an uneven "X", with the thinner side located on the bottom and the wider side on top.  The top "V" from the "X" you created in the previous step and the collar of your shirt should make a loop. Cross the wide end of your tie under the thin end and through the loop.          Bring the wide end back down to where it was before you looped it through the upper "V". ,,, Take the wider end that you just pulled through the loop and put it through the loose knot.          Pull all the way through.  Turn down the collar, making sure to do so neatly at the back where you can't see. Make any adjustments to ensure that the knot sits squarely in the middle of the collar and check that the tie reaches down to the waistband. Done.         

stand in front of a mirror.  put the tie around your neck.  cross the wide end over the narrow end.  bring the tie through the loop.  pull the wide end underneath the narrow end and to the right, back through the "v" loop and to the right again, so that the wide end is inside out.  ,  cross the wide end over the thin end again, crossing to the right.  ,  repeat step three.  ,  there should be somewhat of a loose knot wrapped around the thinner end now.  using both hands, carefully tighten the knot until it is resting a small distance below the collar, about an inch (2.5cm). 

; , Cover the surface with something like a piece of printer of printer paper to avoid getting nail polish on the surface itself. Avoid using newspaper as the print can easily rub off onto the ribbon and spoil it. , A simple narrow strip across the ends will suffice.   Don't paint too much or you'll get stiff ends.  Once it's dry, the ribbons are ready to use again and they won't fray anymore.  

purchase some clear nail polish.  place the fraying ribbon on a flat surface.  use a pair of sharp scissors and carefully cut a diagonal line each end to remove the frayed ends.  ,  carefully paint the ends of the ribbon with the clear nail polish.  leave to dry. 

 Add all solid ingredients to a mixing bowl. With your clean hands or tongs, toss the salad to distribute the ingredients evenly. Drizzle 2 - 3 tbsp (30 - 44 ml) of lemon juice over the ingredients. Thoroughly toss the salad again to spread the juice throughout., Sprinkle salt on your salad a little by little. Toss the salad and taste it to check its flavor after adding salt each time. To add a little more bite to your salad, similarly add garlic powder or crushed black pepper. Increase tartness by adding more lemon juice.The jalapeno in the salad will be toned down by the flavor of the lemon.For a spicier salad, add a small amount of crushed red pepper and mix it in with the other ingredients.  The natural citrus flavor of this dish complements fish well, especially if the fish has been seasoned with lemon juice, lemon zest, or lemon pepper. Include this purslane salad with meals where pork is the main dish, like pork chops.   Offset the spiciness of your salad by cooking fish dishes, like tilapia, with lemon butter. Broil or bake fish then squeeze a few lemon wedges over it. The flavor profile of this summer purslane salad pairs well with Mexican food. Serve the salad with quesadillas, tacos, and burritos., On a hot summer day, this salad will be a refreshing snack. Serve purslane salad with tortilla chips to turn this dish into a light and healthy finger food. Guests can scoop up and eat the salad with chips. Store leftover salad for up to five days in a sealed container in your refrigerator. 

combine your ingredients in a large mixing bowl.  season your salad to taste.  serve the purslane salad as a side.  eat the salad as an appetizer. 

 When you meet someone for the first time, you may be tempted to be someone you're not, such as "putting on your best face". There's nothing wrong with wanting to make a good impression. However, it is possible to take this too far and in turn repel men. The same applies with myths about dressing sexy and excessive flirtation. If you do not respect your body, you will only attract men who have a similar lack of respect for you and your body, and a good man will find it more difficult to take you seriously. Be yourself, and a real man will respect you.; , Desperate, dramatic, and clingy relationships are often rooted in a feeling of need and desperation for a man to fill your life. Even if you have low self-esteem, work over time to build it. Pursue your goals and be focused, explore your passions, have an interesting life, do things that take you outside your boundaries. Don't put up a tough exterior to get over shyness; gradually learn to build trust with a network of people, so that your boyfriend isn't the only person you open up to and share your life with. Also remember to trust yourself first. If you can't trust yourself, you are likely to not trust your man.  Most guys hate it when girls are possessive, moody, clingy, controlling, etc. Learn to relax, and have fun. We all have too much going on in our lives; don't be the high maintenance "drama queen". Having a woman around who makes life more difficult than enjoyable will make a man lose interest. If you do things like show genuine concern when the man has had a rough day, it will earn his respect and go toward winning him over and a good man will reciprocate. Remember that most men, especially the good ones, are looking for someone with whom they can be comfortable, and not someone who is always intense.  Men can often miss the subtle messages that women send in their body language. Don't judge a guy because of this; it's just the way men are. Subtle body language like smiles only make a man think that you might like him; he can't assume it means you're interested without being accused of being a self-absorbed jerk. To drive the point home, gradually introduce more "obvious" body language like playful touches on the arm, playful banter and teasing, winks, inside jokes, playfulness, or (when you know him better) attempts to find a man's ticklish spots. (Don't be afraid to kindly tease him over minor things - women who pretend a man is perfect are regarded as weak in their eyes.) Flirting will not only show him you like him enough to get that physical and playful, but also help to break the physical barrier and allow a man to feel more comfortable making a few advances to you. But don't forget to look at how he is reacting to you.  Psychological studies have shown that people seek out partners to fill a psychological void. Sometimes these voids are unhealthy; for example a woman who is unhealthy will actually seek out any man for the "high of seduction" or to get attention and feel desirable. Look inside yourself and ask yourself why you want a man so badly, be truly honest with yourself, and, if need be, talk to a therapist about this. A woman with issues only attracts a guy with issues as well, and a good, real man doesn't want anything to do with a woman who has more issues than TIME magazine. If you want a good, healthy relationship with a real man, make certain that your own mental state and intentions are healthy.  Nobody likes a partner who plays "head games". This is deceptive, and will hurt anybody who trusts you. Be real, don't play games, and good men will respect you and may even pursue you. Playing head games will only make good men run away. Remember the communication thing? That is especially true here. If you like a guy, don't push him away and act like you don't like him. Tell him. Yes, there are some men who do like the thrill of the chase, but all good men genuinely want to respect you and your wishes, and will leave you alone if you insist on it. Remember, men communicate directly; if you act like you don't want him, he'll think you don't want him.  This is the most important thing of all. Men hate being around a woman who emasculates them, and a good man won't take long to leave such a woman. Don't be afraid to help your man feel good about himself. A little known secret is that men are just as insecure as women. If he's with his friends or family be open to opportunities to let your man look like "the man". It will win his love and respect.  Let's be real: a good man doesn't desperately need any woman; he would like to meet a good woman. If he's a good man, he will appreciate the compliment to his attractiveness, at the very least. But remember that compliments are usually given to acquaintances - people who are intimate usually have a more honest connection, with playful teasing and banter. Think of good relationships between brothers and sisters, parents and children, especially couples - they're always joking, laughing, teasing, flirting in a positive way. A woman who is always complimenting may simply be boring and look desperate. Even if you are old-fashioned and never want to be the woman who asks a man for a date, you can still go out of your way to talk to him, and arrange to be with him. Don't overdo this, however; unless he is already attracted to you before the encounter, the more obvious it is that you've put a ton of time into the encounter without his direct encouragement, the more desperate and less attractive you look. Work on building attraction first.  If you say no, he should stop. If he doesn't stop, leave. Don't ever be uncomfortable saying no. Don't go against your morals to try to keep a guy. If you feel this is necessary, then either he's not a good man, or he is a good one but simply isn't a good match for you specifically (e. g. he is currently "playing the field" and is up front and honest about it, but you're looking for an exclusive relationship). Don't be uncomfortable saying yes, either. If you feel the time is right, believe in your worth and don't worry that you're "giving yourself away." You respect yourself and you're confident that he'll come back for more! A man who doesn't respect you in the morning never properly respected you to begin with, and a man who doesn't respect your wishes to wait is too impatient to make a good partner. Either way, find someone else.  That means apply the same rules to yourself that you'd apply to others, including him. Real men do in fact notice this; they just don't scream it out. For example, if he tells you he has a girlfriend and things are not working out, Stop! and think ladies that this could be a "test" on how you would handle the situation, so stand your ground and cut off communication (hint: "Golden Rule"). Second example: if you do want to try finding his ticklish spots, then don't complain one bit if he tries finding yours in return. Don't go on about how you "don't NEED no man!" or about "men this, men that" if you don't want him treating you the same way. DO, on the other hand, treat him--and others--with respect, dignity, and honor. Others will notice, too, and who knows--if they know you want a good, real man but don't yet have one, they just might introduce you to one!  , This means, don't show that you love this person by being near them all the time. They need their space and they need to know that you don't need to follow them everywhere they go. Most of all, they need to know that you have your own life.  If you want to read more on how to get a man, there's a good e-book that could be useful: www.howtogetaman.org  , Respect yourself and you will find someone who respects you too.  

be yourself.  have a life.  be relaxed and cool.  realize differences in communication.  take a good look at yourself.  drop the games.  treat him with respect.  don't be afraid to make a move.  respect yourself.  follow the golden rule.  don't be clingy.  do some helpful research.  don't lower your standards just because you can't find a good guy. 

 Put the bottle into the freezer or refrigerator for at least half an hour before serving. The alcohol will not freeze, but it should reach a pleasantly cold serving temperature.; , For a standard Jager Bomb, you'll just need one shot's worth: 1.5 ounces. You can certainly take larger Jager Bombs, but this will also require more Red Bull., This is the recipe for a traditional Jager Bomb. Be aware that one 8.4 ounce can of Red Bull contains 80 mg of caffeine.Replace Red Bull with other sugary or caffeinated drinks. Try other brands of energy drink. Try replacing the Red Bull with grape juice or fruity soda products.

 If you toast or roast your pumpkin seeds to perfection, the outer shells don't really need to be removed in order to enjoy the seed inside, although some people like doing this.  In order to do this:          Hold the pumpkin seed in your hand or pop into your mouth Crack the side of pumpkin shell in half using your teeth, like you would a sunflower seed Get at the inner seed and discard the outer shell  

know that many people prefer to eat pumpkin seeds whole, along with the shell.  pry the pumpkin shell open and get at just the seed. 

 If you are a citizen of an EU country, the US, Canada, and some other countries, you won't need a visa to enter Spain as a tourist for 90 days or fewer.For the most part, if you are a citizen of a country in South America, Asia, or Africa, you must get a Schengen visa if you want to travel to Spain as a tourist. A complete list of the countries for which citizens need a Schengen visa to travel to Spain for fewer than 90 days can be found at http://www.exteriores.gob.es/Consulados/LONDRES/en/Consulado/Pages/CheckPassport.aspx.  You can pick up a Schengen tourist visa application form from the Spanish consulate nearest you. You also can download the application from the website of the Schengen visa department at www.schengenvisa.cc.The application form has space for you to provide your name, address, and birthdate. You also must include information about your passport and citizenship, employment, and finances. The application also requires you to provide dates you will be entering and leaving Spain, other Schengen countries you will be visiting, and where you plan to stay while you are in Spain. You also must describe your reason for visiting Spain. For most of the information you list on the form, you must provide documentation to back up your statements.  Along with your application, you must submit copies of your travel itinerary, proof of health and travel insurance, and information about your income.You can get a list of the documents required from the consulate, or by visiting the consulate's website. Take note of the documents that must be translated into Spanish. Generally, you will need a letter from your employer that provides information about your job and annual income. The Spanish government wants to make sure that you will be able to support yourself during your stay and that you aren't planning on staying in Spain in violation of their immigration laws, but that you have a job to return to. If you are self-employed, submit a copy of your most recent tax return.  A Schengen visa allows you to enter any one of the countries participating in the Schengen Agreement. However, you must apply for your visa at the consulate of your main destination, if you plan to visit more than one country.You don't have to visit the consulate in person to apply for a Schengen visa. You can mail it to the correct consulate, but make sure you're leaving enough time for it to get there and be processed before you start your travel. You can only apply for a visa from a consulate or embassy where you are a legal resident. For example, if you are a legal resident of the United States, you cannot submit an application to the Spanish consulate in Portugal. A Schengen visa application must be accompanied by a non-refundable visa fee of 64 euros. This fee is payable by cash or money order only.  From the day the consulate receives your Schengen visa application, it typically takes one or two weeks to be approved. It may take longer at certain high-volume times of the year, or if the consulate requires additional information from you. 

determine if you need a short-term visa.  complete the schengen application form.  attach appropriate documentation.  apply at the correct consulate.  wait for approval. 

 These starters are less expensive and inexpensive to have installed. Multiple-button car starters start your SUV and can lock and unlock doors. Some multiple-button starters are equipped to turn on window defrosters and seat warmers. These are more expensive than single-button starters and are more prone to technical problems, but provide a higher level of convenience.; ,   Mechanics recommend getting a remote automobile starter with a warranty that will last as long as you expect to own your SUV. Buy a car starter with a warranty package that protects against faulty installation or electrical malfunctions.    The specialists that sell you your starter are well-trained in the installation process. There will be an additional fee for installation, but you can be assured that the starter will be installed properly.    Remote starters vary in transmission range. Inexpensive single-button starters typically have a range of 100 (30 m), while more intricate starters can have a range of up to 1,000 feet (300 m). Consider where you typically park your SUV at home, work and when shopping to determine what range will work best for you.    A hood safety switch is an optional safety feature that can be installed with most remote car starters. It prevents the starter from starting your SUV when the vehicle's hood is up. Many car specialists opt not to install the hood safety switch unless specifically requested. Be sure to ask about this feature when you're having your starter installed.    Starters with engine speed detection can read a car's engine RPMs, or revolutions per minute. This will allow your starter to detect if the SUV fails to start when prompted due to cold weather or engine malfunction. Starters with this feature can also turn your SUV off if it is detected that the engine is running too fast, preventing engine damage.  

choose a single- or multiple-button starter  single-button remote car starters function solely to start the suv when you're not in it.  evaluate warranty options.  install it where you buy it.  check transmitter range.  include a hood safety switch.  purchase engine speed detection. 

 Don't always use short sentences or complex sentences; using a variety of sentence structures will make your posts more interesting to read.; , Apostrophes are used for contraction and possession. An example of apostrophes used in contraction is what's (what is). An example of apostrophes used to indicate possession of something is, Hannah's book was a birthday gift. (i.e. Hannah owns--or possesses--the book.)   One important caveat: do not use an apostrophe to indicate possession with the pronoun "it." For example, the sentence, Hannah thought it's cover art was amazing. is wrong. It's is a contraction of it and is. Since, in the example, the cover art belonged to "it," the sentence, when grammatically correct, would be Hannah thought its cover art was amazing.  This is a common mistake. Remember, an effect is the result of something, while to be affected by something is an event,item, etc., on you. A side effect affects you.  Never use a proper noun without its first letter capitalized (e.g. Rolling Stone magazine, not rolling stone magazine).  When writing a sentence that mentions more than one person, it can get confusing whether to use I or me. In situations like this, omit the other person and read the sentence in the singular voice. For example, Amy and I were scared. is correct because if Amy were removed from the sentence and read it in the singular voice, I was scared sounds more correct than 'Me was scared.  Reread it at least once, keeping a vigilant eye for typos and other errors.  

vary your sentences.  use apostrophes correctly.  affect or effect?,  capitalize proper nouns.  i or me?,  proofread. 

 The holiday season is both joyful and stressful at once. There is family to get along with, gifts to buy and return, people to visit, activities to throw yourself into, plenty of festive food to eat, sales to rush to, and parties to plan and attend. Topped off with the excitement of New Year's Eve, your adrenaline has probably been pumping a lot of the time during the Christmas and New Year's period. Returning to the usual routine and probably quieter workplace than normal can dampen your spirits just by the absence of exciting things to do and look forward to. Equally, if your Christmas and New Year's Eve period wasn't as enjoyable as you had hoped, you can be left feeling down about the lack of enjoyment you'd expected and this can sour your mood. Expecting to feel a little low is a way of telling yourself that this is a normal feeling and that it will soon pass once the routine re-establishes itself.   Look at your past experiences to enlighten you as to your normal post-holiday feelings. Do you always fall into a slump after the holiday season? If you have spent period after last two holidays in despair, then the chances of this post holiday period continuing in despair are high. Look carefully about what you did last time and what relaxed you. And realize that generally this is a phase that is easily fixed.; , The good side to the end of the holidays is that you've had a chance to rest, to relax, and to enjoy yourself. The craziness prior to Christmas has ended both at the workplace and in the home, and the restful time after Christmas and New Year's Eve has hopefully given you the opportunity to do things that are different from your usual routine. And any break in the routine is good for the spirit, providing you with the chance to rejuvenate.   Take it easy when you're settling back down into your usual routine. Your more rested self is a good thing and gives you an opportunity to take a renewed perspective on your work, routine, study, or home life pace. Perhaps the break has given you perspective on your life, job, relationships etc. If so, this is a good time to consider making changes to improve your situation, especially because not making the changes can prolong your blues.  If you set the bar too high and you already feel as if you're slipping, don't berate yourself. Instead, look at your resolutions realistically and assess whether they need some tweaking to ensure that they're achievable. Discard the resolutions that required you to be too harsh on yourself and reform them into ones that can be met now that the heady atmosphere of New Year's Eve is behind you. Think of it as a double checking of the details, and simply fiddle with the fine print!   Ensure that any goals you've set are reasonable and most importantly achievable. Taking weight loss as an example, targeting for a size zero is unrealistic, but looking for 1 pound loss in a span of week seems to be more achievable.  Some of the post-holiday season blues might be related to having been around many people over the Christmas break and then suddenly finding yourself surrounded by people you don't know that well, or even not by many people at all. Lift your spirits by continuing to stay connected with friends and family, and getting out and about to do activities where other people interact with you.  Revive the excitement of anticipation by arranging fun activities, such as having dinner with friends, starting a new class for a hobby or interest, attending a sporting event regularly, going to the movies, etc. Choose activities that meet your budget and interests, and that you know will give you a thrill.  After the many indulgences over the holiday period, it can leave you feeling a little out of shape and worse for wear in the nutrition department. Aim to return to eating healthy food, drinking healthy drinks, and ensuring that you keep getting a good amount of exercise. Eating well and keeping up regular exercise will enhance your mood and help you return to good shape and fitness levels. If you're worried about not keeping warm enough during the colder weather, have more healthy chunky, warming soups that will both warm and fill you up without carrying lots of calories. Warm salads are also an excellent choice during winter.   Eat away your blues. Eat foods that boost your serotonin (feel good) neurotransmitters. Suitable foods containing tryptophan (the building block for serotonin) include bananas, poultry, dairy produce, and peas.Keep exercising no matter the weather, lethargy and weight excuses. Exercise will give you the mood-boost you need and gets you moving again. If you're living in a cold climate, there are plenty of winter exercising options such as walking, skiing, and gym workouts. You could also stay inside and exercise on an indoor exercise bike if you have one. For those in a hot climate, swimming, hiking, and water sports are ideal mood lifters.  The holiday season tends to put a hold on pressing issues at work and in your personal life because the celebrations, meet-ups, and preparations require your foremost attention. Once this busyness dies down, you're returned to thinking about your general life issues and this might just be a good time to get help from the professionals, be it for anything from sorting out your finances, redecorating your home, or dealing with the unhappy feelings you're experiencing.   If you didn't plan too well for the holidays and find yourself deep down in the debt rack, get financial advice immediately and start to sort out the finances sooner rather than later. It might reduce the indulgences for now but this is probably the best time to feel the least deprived about indulgences!  , Trying to keep a positive frame of mind and planning for interesting and fulfilling events throughout the year is a good way to calm your current blues. Think ahead to the changing seasons and the sorts of things you'd like to be doing as the year moves on, and the sorts of activities and events you'd like to be a part of. Doing something about the things you'd like to happen is the first step and once you're immersed in planning and doing, you'll be too busy to fret.   If you want to travel, start planning the trip and budget now. If you've got big plans ahead like your own or someone else's wedding, having a baby, renovating a home, taking your parents on a cruise, etc., throw yourself into planning. If you're yearning for certain aspects of your life to change, such as going from being single to being part of a couple, use this time to plan how you will make this happen, such as putting yourself out there more, joining a club, or spending time using specific online sites, etc.  

expect some letdown.  choose to see the benefits of post-holiday time.  be gentle on yourself with respect to your new year's resolutions.  continue spending time around people.  do things that give you cause to look forward to something.  make healthy choices.  make this a time for getting professional help and turning around things that have been bothering you.  expect to enjoy the year ahead. 

   Net electric flux through a closed surface with enclosed charge q is the integral of the dot product between the electric field and the instantaneous surface area vector. The integral of the instantaneous surface area is simply the surface area vector. The electric field at a distance outside a Gaussian surface will be constant at that specific distance.    Choose one that best fits its dimensions. A solid sphere or spherical shell of charge Q would require the use of a sphere, while a line or rod of charge would require a cylinder. A solid sphere or hollow spherical shell with uniform charge distribution can be treated as if all charge were concentrated at the center (a point charge), therefore the radius of your Gaussian surface would be the radius of your sphere plus the distance away from the sphere's surface.    Frequent formulas are 4pi r squared and pi r squared. ,   With the proper Gaussian surface, the electric field and surface area vectors will nearly always be parallel. 

know the formula for the electric flux through a closed surface.  draw an imaginary gaussian surface around your charge.  determine the surface area of your gaussian surface.determine the electric field going through your gaussian surface.  multiply the magnitude of your surface area vector by the magnitude of your electric field vector and the cosine of the angle between them.do not forget to add the proper units for electric flux. 

 Be close, but try to give yourself enough room to maneuver your hands. Let your hands fall forward. With your fingers pointing at a downward angle, slowly move your hands next to the dryer opening.  Jet air dryers are motion activated, so air flow will start once your hand movement is detected. Try to make this movement swift. Sometimes, slower movements will not be detected.  Be sure to lower both hands entirely. You want to make sure that the air surrounds your wrists and hands.  Gently raise both hands upward until they are almost out of the air stream. Move them in a way that allows them to brush against the airflow.  When the airflow hits your fingertips, place your hands back into the airflow. You want your hands to be thoroughly covered.  Repeat these motions until your hands are completely dry. You may even want to turn your hands so that your palms are facing upwards. This will ensure that both sides of your hands are dry.   There is some concern that jet air or warm air dryers spread bacteria and germs. 

stand in front of the jet air dryer.  continue the downward movement.  lower your hands.  pull your hands back up.  dip your hands back into the airflow.  continue to lower and raise your hands. 

 Thinking positive thoughts is a direct way to restore your mind. To help yourself have the ability think positively, do things like accepting your own limitations, letting go of guilt, and telling yourself that you are doing a good job.  If you find your thoughts constantly turning negative, start putting up sticky notes in your office or around your house as reminders. Put inspiring notes on them, such as this quote by Louisa May Alcott, author of Little Women: “I am not afraid of storms, for I am learning how to sail my ship.” Remove negative influences from your surroundings, like bad news on TV or music that repeats offensive messages.  If you have a stressful job and feel weary after a long day, jumping into an activity you see as a pleasure can help you feel refreshed. Do something like read a book, go see a movie, or listen to music to change your mindset and have fun.You can also pick up a new hobby like sewing, drawing or painting, making something with your hands like jewelry—the possibilities are nearly limitless.  Laughing is good for you, no matter how you look at it. It has a positive effect on your heart, activates muscles, ups your oxygen, and promotes relaxation. If you are feeling harried, find a good comedy video on your smartphone or make a date with a friend who makes you laugh.  Laughing also takes away stress hormones and increases the release of endorphins (which make you feel good).If you know of a funny movie that is out on video, rent it to take home so you can laugh with your family.  Get out of your routine now and then by going on an outing to a place you know is fun, or try a new place that sounds fun. Nothing makes you feel more refreshed than a new pleasure experience. Feeling refreshed means that your strength is restored, and the new perspective that comes from visiting a new place does just that.Try visiting a local eatery you’ve been wanting to test out, or go to the nearest amusement park. Other destination ideas include local events like the farmers’ market or local festivals, wandering around a local park, taking in a play, and many more.  Staying in contact with the outside world is important for your mental health as well as a key to feeling refreshed. In fact, studies show that people in chronic isolation have higher blood pressure and a greater aptitude for developing dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.Talking to other people about their issues rather than your own is a good way to forget your worries and get strength. Friends can encourage you, which is part of the definition of refreshment—feeling your strength restored., Getting outside of your comfort zone can remind you that others are not as fortunate as you, which changes your routine and breaths refreshment into your routine. You can offer to help a friend with a difficult task, or you can serve up food at the local soup kitchen.  Treat yourself for stress or depression by eliminating the stressors you have control over. For example, you may not be able to quit a stressful job, but you can get that squeaky belt on your car fixed, or mow the grass so that your shoes don’t get wet on the way to your car in the morning.   Reduce symptoms of depression by talking to someone about the way you feel.  Organize your money so that stacked up bills don’t weigh on your mind. If you are having a hard time making bill payments, ask friends and family to help you make a plan to positively impact your finances. You can also hire a financial advisor to give you advice.   For example, make a budget and move to a cash system where you allocate a specified amount of each paycheck toward the different parts of your monthly obligations, and spend no more than that.  

think positively.  perform activities that bring you joy.  make sure you laugh.  go somewhere fun.  avoid isolating yourself.  perform an act of service.  reduce stress.  take care of your finances. 

 Make sure that the path you will utilize to move the sofa bed is or will be clear of all obstructions. Also take note of low ceilings or extremely narrow passages. Use a measuring tape, if available, to measure the width and heights of these obstacles and compare them against the dimensions of the sofa.; , Make sure you and your moving partner are clear about what you will be doing so you can synchronize your actions to make the move more efficient and less likely to hurt anyone. Discuss and rehearse the movement for the areas that may cause a potential problem in moving the sofa.  To lighten the load, remove the mattress. This can usually be done by fully extending the sofa bed to its bed position. On the underside you will notice fabric ties connected to the mattress and then knotted around the frame. Untie each of the ties and move the mattress to an area out of the way. Once this is complete, fold the frame back into the sofa. Do not replace any of the pillows or cushions.  You will want to tie off the metal frame in order to prevent it from unfolding while you are moving the sofa bed. To do this you will need a rope approximately 4 feet (1.2 m) in length. In the front of the sofa, where one would sit and around the center tie the mattress to the front of the sofa bed. If this is not available you can tie the mattress to the back or the arms of the sofa.  Now you will want to lay the cardboard on the ground and lay the back of the sofa bed on to the cardboard. At this point you may decide to use the rope to secure the sofa bed to the piece of cardboard. If you have furniture dollies you can set the sofa on them after you have secured the sofa on the cardboard.  If possible remove the feet of the sofa to ease its passage through doors. If this is not possible, skip to next step.  Slide the sofa on its back on the cardboard (and furniture dollies) to the first door. If the feet are removed it should narrowly pass right through. If not, you may have to angle it such that each set of feet pass through.  Remove the furniture dollies, if you have them. Slide the sofa forward while holding down pressure on the side furthest from the stairs. The sofa will begin to tilt downwards as it is moved forward. Slowly allow the sofa to lay on the stairs. Move the sofa until it is completely on the stairs. The person furthest down the stairs will need to make sure the cardboard does not catch on the stairs and direct the person highest on the stairs of when to push. The cardboard reduces the friction between the sofa and the stairs, thus making the stairs an easy obstacle to deal with. If the stairs corner or change direction, as in a flight of stairs, you will need to stand the sofa up on one of its ends (the arms). Then walk it, that is to say move it as though it were walking by sliding one side then the other, to the next flight of stairs such that the cardboard is facing the side of the stairs. Slowing lay the sofa down on the stairs. One person will need to guide the sofa down while ensuring that it does not slip while the other person will need to use their hands over their head to ease the sofa back down on the stairway slope. Repeat this step until the sofa is completely down the stairs.  Slide the sofa, or replace the furniture dollies and roll, to its desired location.  

clear a path.  have a plan of action.  remove the mattress and pillows.  tie off the frame.  lay sofa bed on its back.  remove the feet.  move the sofa through the door.  move the sofa down the stairs.  continue sliding the sofa. 

 Claudia has long hair and is Asian, so a long black wig is a must for this. Even if you are not Asian, you can do this with a long black wig! Extra points for ponytails.; , Claudia has one hole in one ear and two in the other, but you can use one pierced pair and one clip pair or three clip earrings.  This is one of Claudia's trademarks.  Claudia thinks things from health food stores are for the birds - literally. Rather, Pop Tarts are a good breakfast if you want to cosplay as her. Pizza is another good food choice for this cosplay, as long as it has no anchovies and none of such things as spinach or broccoli. Mushrooms, olives, onions and meat toppings are all great for this (best if it has all four!).  Claudia is an artist to the nth degree. Here are some ideas for things that she may make, but feel free to make your own objects:    Paper doll food. Best for Claudia would be bacon, pizza, cookies, and burgers.  Paper people. Extra points if the person looks Asian or if it is an elderly woman (which would then represent Claudia's grandmother Mimi, who dies in book 26 of the series).  Clay dragons. This would also show off how proud she is of her Asian heritage!  , These are her favorite books.  Claudia would never in a million years be caught doing nerdy things, and she hates studying.

 Every state has its own rules, and you’ll want to start your transition on the right legal foot. You can find an overview of current homeschool laws here: https://www.responsiblehomeschooling.org/policy-issues/current-policy/   Twenty-four states currently require some periodic assessment of your child’s knowledge. This assessment usually follows one of two formats: standardized testing or a portfolio review. Standardized testing can be arranged either through local public schools or independently.For a portfolio review, a certified teacher will examine and approve a collection of your child’s work, including writing samples, reading lists, math tests, and science labs. If your state relies on portfolio reviews, you’ll want to start saving examples of your child’s work as soon as you begin homeschooling.; , You’ll be responsible for school supplies, books, and any online curricular content you purchase. Create a list of these costs and incorporate them into your family’s financial planning., While not all states require that you inform the school about your plan to withdraw, it’s a good idea to exit your public school with courtesy. Have an open conversation explaining why you want to switch, and ask for any advice administrators or teachers might be willing to share.Especially if your child plans to continue participating in extracurricular activities, you’ll want to maintain a good relationship with the school community.  If your child has been in public school for several years, the district will have a file containing their medical and academic records. You’ll want to access these records to make sure they’re not lost when you withdraw your child, and so you are fully aware of your child’s educational experience up to this point., Be honest and clear about your plan to withdraw your child from public school, talk about their needs, and be sure to listen to what they have to say.   Try asking your child questions about what they like and don’t like about school now, and what they would want to learn about if they could pick their own lessons. This will jumpstart a conversation that allows you both to talk about your expectations for homeschooling.Give your child plenty of time to reflect on your conversation and their new reality. Introduce the topic well ahead of the date you plan to withdraw.  There are many different teaching methods and curricula available for homeschooling. Reflect on your reasons for switching along with your child’s learning preferences, and develop your approach according to their unique needs.Choosing your curriculum will largely depend on how your child best learns and how you best teach. You’ll want to decide whether to adhere to a more traditional, textbook-based curriculum, or to take the alternative route by designing and compiling a less structured curriculum. Some parents choose to participate in established online homeschools. The main benefit of these programs is that much of the content preparation is done for you.  Taking the time to research other parents’ experiences with various homeschooling materials and online schools is the best way to ensure that you’re purchasing high-quality content that works. Reviews will also usually specify the driving teaching philosophy of the curriculum., Up to this point, your child will have spent a large majority of their time at a school that’s not your home. Give them a few weeks off from academic study so they can process their emotions regarding this shift.   Some homeschooling parents recommend giving your child at least two weeks and up to a month of time off from school before beginning your homeschool curriculum. During this transition, you may want to incorporate hands-on lessons to maintain or renew your child’s enthusiasm for learning. You can explain the chemistry behind baking cookies or take a nature walk through the woods., Pick hours that work for your family, and stick to that plan. Even though flexibility and spontaneity are hallmarks of successful homeschools, especially at the beginning of the transition, you’ll want to ensure that your child recognizes that their home is now also their school.   To set up this schedule, reflect on which hours of the day your child has the hardest and easiest time learning. Schedule difficult subjects during their high-attention hours, and easier ones when they might need less brain power. Be sure not to block more than 45 minutes to an hour of any one subject. You don’t need to adhere to typical 8:00-3:00 public school hours, but your child may crave continuity as they move away from the public-school model and begin learning in a new environment.  Public schools build in blocks of time for children to either play outside, rest, or study independently, allowing children time to recharge. Make sure that these “relaxed” blocks of time are part of your daily schedule so that your child’s school day contains both work and play., Even if your state doesn’t require that you be prepared for a portfolio review, it’s a good idea to keep orderly records of your child’s progress. This will help your child if they choose to apply to college, or they want to transition back to public school at a later date.  This will be a learning process for you and your child. Make sure your child knows that you’re open to their ideas, comments, questions, and critiques. This will allow your child to feel invested in the transition and their new education.Your child may initially ask you to replicate certain elements of their public school experience. While you made this transition for a reason, let your child guide the pace of the switch.  When your child leaves their public school, they may be most worried about leaving their friends behind. In order to ensure that you and your family are remaining socially connected, continue or expand your child’s involvement in extracurricular activities.   Many extracurricular activities are not directly connected to the public school system, including civic clubs such as the Girl or Boy Scouts. Sports teams may also be organized through the community, rather than the school. Be aware of your options, and be sure to budget for the extra costs of these activities.  Even if your child isn’t a fan of extracurricular activities, they’ll surely miss their friends as they transition away from public school. Schedule periodic visits between your child and their closest friends. Make sure your child knows that they can rely on you to make these social activities a consistent part of their life.  There will almost certainly be ups and downs over the course of this transition. Tell your extended family and friends about your plans, and get ready to rely on them when you need it. There are also many online and in-person support groups for homeschooling parents that you should look into joining.   If a homeschool support group doesn’t yet exist in your area, consider starting one. There may be other parents who feel a similar need in your community, and they’ll be grateful for your efforts.  

check the legal requirements for homeschooling in your state.  make a budget for your homeschool.  notify your local school officials and teachers.  secure your child’s records.  discuss the plan with your child.  explore homeschooling options.  read user reviews.  take time to adjust.  establish a daily schedule.  add time for recreation.  keep track of your child’s work.  ask for feedback.  stay involved in the community.  set playdates.  build a support network. 

 This step is key to producing a well-integrated strawberry flavor.   Place the stemmed strawberries into a food processor and pulse until the strawberries are liquified.  In a medium bowl, combine the strawberry liquid and strawberry pudding mix.   Mix the two until they’re thoroughly combined.  Once the strawberry liquid and pudding mix have been combined, gently fold in the whipped topping.   Continue combining until all of the ingredients are well-combined and a uniform color.  Use a butter knife or spatula to spread the frosting, several tablespoons at a time, over the surface of the dessert.   Or, if you prefer, use a pastry bag (or plastic storage bag with a small hole in one corner) equipped with a frosting tip to frost your dessert. You can use this frosting for cupcakes, shortcake, angel food cake, sheet cake, brownies, or refrigerator pies.  

liquify the strawberries.  combine strawberry liquid and pudding mix.  fold in the whipped topping.  spread over your dessert. 

 When making your custom brush, you will need to derive a black and white image of your cloud to make your custom brush, so try to find an image that will translate well to grayscale and open this image in Photoshop., This is one of several ways to quickly change your image from color to grayscale, and can be found under the "Image" heading on the menu bar. Under "Image," select "Desaturate" to convert your image.Windows users can make use of the hotkeys: Ctrl+⇧ Shift+U  Mac users can utilize the hotkeys: ⌘ Cmd+⇧ Shift+U   , Using the selection tool, chose a sample from your cloud image that you would like your brush to imitate. Be sure to limit your brush size to a maximum of 2500x2500 pixels, as this is the largest brush size., Now that you have your brush sample in black and white and selected, click on "Edit" from the top menu bar and then choose "Define Brush Preset." This will prompt a dialogue box asking you to name your new brush.  You can quickly open Brush Settings by pressing the F5 key. Opacity and size can be adjusted in brush settings, and these can give the illusion of variety to even repetitive brush patterns.

 Toasting will make the nuts more fragrant and flavorful.Stir occasionally to prevent burning. Toast until they release a strong nutty aroma, then remove from the pan and set aside., Stir to combine. Do not worry if all the sugar and salt don’t dissolve.You can also add additional ingredients to spice up the recipe:   Add 1 teaspoon cinnamon for delicious cinnamon-sugar nuts.Add ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper for spicier nuts.For really flavor-packed nuts, add ¼ teaspoon cumin, ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, ¼ teaspoon cinnamon, and ¼ teaspoon dried ground orange peel., Cook until the sugar dissolves and is bubbling – approximately 5 minutes., This should take only 15 seconds or so., Either separate them immediately with forks, or wait until they have cooled and break the nuts apart. Store in an airtight container.

 Not all Craigslist postings are created equal; some will have less information than others and that is okay. However, it is important to take a look at the information that is there and check for red flags that could mean the posting a scam. These red flags would be if the posting:   Consists of only a few words. For example, “Need writer”. A reputable company would put more effort into specifying the type of writer they need and what you would be writing about. Has grammatical errors. Numerous errors shows a lack of effort that should make you consider whether or not this posting is from a reputable company. Provides no contact information. Your only option will then be to reply to the job posting through Craigslist. It is still okay to apply, but if you are concerned, you can choose to exclude certain personal information (like your home address). Leaves you with many questions. If you find yourself looking for basic information like company, location, title, job duties, etc. it may be a fictitious posting.; , If the company’s name is listed, research it. Doing your homework and checking out the company will help you to get an idea of what the company is like and whether or not it seems legitimate. Keep in mind, it is not necessarily a scam if the company wishes to remain confidential at first. However, this information must be provided if you are asked to do an interview.   Read or click through their website. Does the website look professional? Is the job listed on a “careers page”? Do you have an understanding of what the company does after looking at their site? Call a general number provided and, if possible, speak to someone. If someone answered the phone, did they use a professional greeting such as “Company B, how may I help you?” If someone did not answer the phone, was there a professional sounding voice mail?  , If you are looking at a Craigslist posting and can’t find any contact information, or the information seems odd, go to the company’s website and verify their contact information. Be cautious if asked to contact someone’s cell phone or personal email, as this could indicate that it is not a legitimate company.   Search the company website to verify the number in the posting. Use a phone directory that will provide details about the number. Take caution when emailing an address that does not seem professional. For example, “kitty345@mail.com” should most likely not be considered a professional email address, until you are emailing Kitty Magazine in the 345 area code (which is very unlikely).  Only necessary information should be submitted. This generally means a cover letter and resume. A writing sample might also be requested, but beware of providing any lengthy or detailed work without talks of compensation.   If you have the option to choose your writing sample, provide a sample that is already published so that you do not have to worry about the sample being published without your permission (because you can call in backup from the company or organization that already published the work). If you do not have a sample or you are required to write something specific, ask for payment and put the terms in writing.  It is not necessary to provide SSN, credit card, bank account, other financial and/or medical information when applying to a job. A legitimate company will not ask you for this information in the application process.Even after the interview process, personal financial and credit card information should not be shared. If a company requires bank account information for direct deposit or SSN, it will be asked of you after you are hired.  There are some things you should never do when applying for a job on Craigslist or through other job engines. While many posts are legitimate, there are still scams and people wanting to exploit you out there that you need to be aware of. To protect yourself and your assets, it is really important that you remember these Do Nots:   DO NOT provide detailed personal information that is not necessary to do the job. DO NOT provide SSN and/or bank account information prior to being hired. DO NOT accept wired money or rare forms of payment. DO NOT provide more than 1 sample of your work without being compensated. DO NOT continue to work or provide lengthier “samples” if not paid as scheduled.  

read the job posting carefully and look for red flags.  research the company before applying.  look for contact information that appears professional.  submit only the required documents, like a cover letter or resume.  do not apply to a position that asks for detailed personal information in the job posting.  remember the do nots.

 Many clowns wear wigs over their real hair. Be sure to try on your wig at the costume shop to make sure it fits. Clowns often have rainbow-colored wigs.; , Wear something that fits your style, matches your outfit, and looks a little bit outrageous. Feel free to layer a bright jacket or blazer over your shirt, too. Find one at either a costume shop or a thrift store.  Clowns often wear very bright colors and prints. They also wear a lot of primary colors. Choose pants that match your current ensemble. Buy these at a costume shop. Pajama pants will also work!, Really large ties tend to look best on clowns because the rest of their outfits are already oversized.

 Just as there isn't a clear step-by-step process to win everyone over, there's no one way to dress well. This open-endedness isn't a bad thing. Rather, there are endless possibilities through which you can express yourself. Aim to dress to suit the occasion you're taking part of, whether it's a wedding, funeral, or weekend party. For more general circumstances, it's a good idea to take a look at the clothes you currently wear and ask yourself what kind of impression that would give across to someone who saw you on the street.   You don't need to follow current fashion trends, but it does help to check up some of the more recent styles for inspiration in finding your own look. This includes making sure your clothes are freshly laundered regularly, especially if you're on the brink of a high-priority meeting like a first date or job interview.; , Improper sleep has a list of bad effects on you and your body. You'll never be in your best mood without proper rest, and your body will look drained and pale. It's recommended you try to get at least 7 hours of sleep each night. Although this may be difficult to accomplish for some, there are lots of things you can do to improve on your sleep. Avoid caffeine and stay away from electronics in the hour before getting to sleep if you can., Remember to attend to basics. This includes trimming your nails, brushing your hair, brushing your teeth at least twice a day, and showering regularly.   Keeping up with hygiene's especially important if you have a physically strenuous lifestyle.  A solid posture and assertive stance make you naturally look more powerful and reliable. On the other hand, being slouched over will have a negative reaction from whomever sees you like that. Positive body language also has a benefit on your self-confidence.   Smiling is a universal tool for sending positive feelings. There are numerous benefits for both smiling and being smiled at.Don't forget to smile whenever you meet someone for the first time. Strong eye contact is essential. Make sure you're looking directly at whomever you're talking to.  Even if there's a lot of nagging self-doubt, confidence is necessary if you want to maximize your chances at winning people over. Having a firm belief in yourself is something that goes over well with practically everyone. When you have confidence, other things like charm and collectedness fall into place like clockwork.   Try asking some of your friends some good things they like about you. Even if you find yourself clouded in self-doubt, they'll probably see a much better version of you. If you think it will help, make up a list of ten things you like about yourself or are proud of. Don't be modest on your list and don't underrate the things you've already accomplished in your life. Once you have a full list of things you have to offer other people, you'll be able to look at it and be reminded of everything you have to offer the world.  Gratitude is a reminder that the person thinks highly of whomever they're talking to and sincerely appreciates all they do. If someone does something for you, make sure to thank them for it. You should always thank someone for their time after meeting them for the first time. Time itself is valuable, and the other person will be made to feel special.   Make sure the way you're expressing gratitude is appropriate to what you're being thankful for. For example, if someone has held open a door for you, a simple "thank you" usually suffices. On the other hand, if you've recently been offered a great raise by your employer, a more in-depth thank you (such as a written letter) may be more appropriate.  They don't try to hide what they're feeling. Emotional expressiveness also allows you to relate to the other person on more than just a mental level. Don't be afraid to let feeling come into whatever you're talking about. So long as it's kept within appropriate boundaries, everyone likes a person who sounds passionate or moved but the thing they're talking about.   Especially if you're meeting someone, you should probably limit your range of emotions to the positive-leaning end of the spectrum. Coming off as an angry or embittered person isn't likely going to win somebody over.  A lot of research shows that people have a hard time being charmed by those they think are out of their league. A lot of the most charming movie actors have traits that are otherwise completely normal, and this is why they are so appealing.If you want to win someone over, you shouldn't try to give the impression that you're somehow completely better than them. Your best bet is to find common ground. Make yourself relatable to the person they're talking to. Even if you're coming from opposite backgrounds, make it sound like the other person is talking to an equal.  Instead, people tend to feel endeared towards people who aren't afraid to show their weak points. There is a difference between this and dwelling on your failures. People don't like a sob story. You want to show these vulnerabilities while all the while expressing confidence and security. This proves to others that you are bigger than any of your weaknesses.   Any character flaw can improve if you put your heart to it. There is a world of differences between someone who likes to relax and someone lazy. Some good weaknesses, per example, would be being clumsy or having a soft heart towards kitten. Self-deprecating humour is a good way to express vulnerability without making it seem like you're dwelling on the negative. By turning something touchy into an excuse to make other people laugh, you can show people you're stronger than your insecurities.  Once you've won someone over, it's another thing entirely to keep that relationship healthy and afloat.Making connections takes charm, while keeping them healthy takes trust and understanding. Once you have a bond with someone, it's important to let each other in on the details of your lives as if you were still just getting to know each other. In this way, a friendship or relationship will continue to grow.  If you have won someone over, you can do a lot to make your ties stronger by winning at things together. If there's a contest you're going to take part of, it doesn't hurt to bring this person into it as well.   On the other hand, you can set parallel goals and keep one another accountable for their own. For instance, if the two of you have a weight loss goal, you can keep each other motivated by telling the other how much you've lost and what you're doing to get there.  No doubt it makes you feel a lot better when someone gives you affection. The same works both ways. Make sure to return affection when it's given by someone you care about. This may be a difficult thing to do at first if you're a naturally cold person, but the benefits will be apparent for you as much as the other person. Research shows that people are happier when they regularly express gratitude and affection for people they care about.If affection doesn't come naturally to you, you should try to mirror the affection that's been given to you. For example, if someone smiles, it is generally good form to return the smile. Make sure you feel the affection as sincerely as the other person does. If you're trying to force returned affection, it will seem like you're being condescending.  Patience is a necessary virtue for practically all relationships. If you've developed a meaningful connection with someone, you'll need to acknowledge that there will be times where communication might be slow.Life events can take their toll on a person, and limit the amount you'll get to see them. Don't take the changes personally. Accept the fact that everyone changes over time, and be patient towards the challenges that may create.  

dress to impress.  get enough sleep.  maintain good hygiene.even if you're the best looking person in the room, you're not going to get anywhere if someone doesn't think you care about the way you look.  assert yourself through positive body language.body language is a key ingredient in getting people to like you without having to open up your mouth.  develop a sense of confidence.confidence is a tricky thing for some people to find.  show gratitude.the most charming people out there are always happy to show someone how they really feel through the power of gratitude.  express yourself emotionally.the most charismatic people are open to express their feelings with sincerity.  make yourself relatable.  allow yourself to show vulnerability.although it may seem like the most charming individuals would also be the strongest or most perfect, that's the farthest thing from the truth.  stay committed.  set goals together.regardless whether you're in a romantic relationship or something completely platonic, setting out goals and accomplishing them as a team brings people closer together.  return the affection.  be patient. 

 You will need a large white egg, a needle, a paper clip, a drinking straw, scissors, alum powder, white glue, a small paintbrush, a glass container, food coloring or easter egg dye, a spoon, latex gloves, and a drying rack or newspaper., Take the needle and poke a small hole in one end of the egg. Unfold the paper clip and poke it into the egg. Stir to mix the yolk with the egg whites. Poke a hole in the other end of the egg that is large enough to contain a drinking straw. Position the egg above the sink or a bowl, and gently blow through the straw until the egg is empty., Use a small pair of scissors to cut the shell into two tidy halves. If you are having trouble splitting the eggshell, tap it lightly on the counter to crack it. Clean any remaining egg yolk from the shell., Use your small paintbrush to apply white glue to the inside and the edges of each eggshell half. Sprinkle the wet glue with alum powder until the eggshell's inside surface is entirely coated.Leave to dry overnight.  Boil water and let sit while you get your glass container. Mix two cups of the hot water with 30 drops of food coloring or an entire packet of egg dye in the container.

If they are not all dissolved, place the solution in the microwave for a few seconds. Otherwise, the alum might not attach to the geode., Let the mixture cool for about half an hour. Then dip one of the dry eggshell into the mixture. Position it at the bottom of the container so that its hollow faces up. Leave for 12-15 hours., Put on your latex gloves and remove the geode very carefully. If you are pleased with the crystals, dry your geode on the rack. If not, return it to the solution for another day or so.You can re-use the solution to geodify the other half of the eggshell! Just the solution in the microwave first, so that the spare crystals dissolve. The egg shell is part of the geode. Do not attempt to remove it.

 Jokers, or class clowns, devote their time and energy to providing comic relief for the classroom. When you are in the mood for the class clown’s antics, their jokes are hilarious; when you are not in the mood, their attempts and humor can drive you mad. Since class clowns thrive on the reaction of their “crowd,” the best way to ignore a joker is to have no physical or verbal reaction to their jokes.   Class clowns aim to please and are highly sensitive to criticism. If you can not remain silent, a choice remark could put a temporary end to their comedy bit.If you get in trouble for something the class clown did, don’t overreact. Remain calm and ask the teacher to speak with you after class. When you are speaking one on one with the teacher, explain your side of the story and apologize for any inconvenience you may have caused. Work with your teacher to develop a plan on how to avoid situations like this in the future.  Overly competitive students thrive on the knowledge that they are better than others. Their determination to prove themselves as superior students can leave others in the class feeling unintelligent and overlooked. If a competitive classmate asks you how you did on an assignment, they are just looking for chance to brag about their score. When this happens, just walk away. If their pestering persists, tell them that you prefer to keep your grades private.For example, you may say: “Sorry, I like to keep that kind of information to myself,” “You did really well on the test. Thanks for sharing your score; I prefer to keep mine private,” or “Please stop asking me. I am not comfortable sharing my grade with you.”  , Overly talkative classmates often struggle with self-awareness and egotism. Ignoring chatterboxes is extremely difficult. Their incessant chatter is inconsiderate and distracting. Try to tune them out and stay focused on the lecture or task at hand. If necessary, politely ask them to be quiet or speak softer.For instance, you may say: “I’m having a hard time hearing the teacher. Will you please lower your voice or stop talking?” or “Your talking is really distracting me. Can you stop talking so that I can focus?” If you could not hear what your teacher said, raise your hand and ask them to repeat it. “Sorry, I missed what you said over all the chatter. Can you say that again, please?” If you are at your wits end, seek help from your teacher. Stay after class and talk to your teacher about the chatterbox. Your teacher may rearrange the seating chart and or talk to the student privately.  

pay no attention to the class clown.  limit your interactions with competitive students.  tune out chatterboxes. 

 One of the most common ways that LSD is distributed is through small square pieces of paper.The sheets of paper often have colorful markings or cartoon characters on them. These papers are also known as blotters.   If you notice some small squares of colorful paper in the person’s room, then he or she may be using LSD.  LSD drops are often stored in small dropper bottles, such as empty fresh breath drop bottles.The bottles are only about two inches tall. The liquid LSD may also be dyed to make it less obvious that the liquid inside is LSD.  People who use LSD often apply drops of the drug to sugar cubes for consumption.If you notice any plastic bags containing sugar cubes in the person’s room, then this could be a sign that he or she is using LSD.  Having a drug habit is expensive, so someone who uses LSD regularly may often be low on cash. Consider how often the person asks for money and how quickly he or she spends it.   For example, if the person asks to borrow money a few days after he or she has been paid, then this may indicate that he or she is spending money on drugs.  

watch for small colorful pieces of paper.  look for small dropper bottles.  check for sugar cubes.  monitor the person’s spending habits. 

 Truly listen to what the other person is saying. One way to physically show that you are listening is to stop doing anything else you are doing. Look the person in the eye. Let the person talk, and don't interrupt until he or she is done., One way to show you value another person is to give them the gift of your time. Watch a movie together, or cook dinner together. Go out for a special outing. It doesn't really matter what you do as long as you are taking the time to enjoy each others' company., Everyone needs some kind of hobby or outlet, and it's often different for each member of a family. Ask questions about what's going on with your family members' hobbies on a regular basis, and show up for important events if you can, such as going to dance recitals or baseball games.  If you notice another family member is upset, try to offer them comfort. One thing you can do is just listen to what's bothering them and try to help where you can.  

be present when talking.  spend time with each other.  support your family members' interests.  offer comfort when someone is sad.

Opt for a signal strength of more than 50%.  This will select your current network's name.   Changing the name here may cause issues with your Internet connection on other devices.  This will set your network's security type as WPA, which is supported by the PSP., Press X on the "WPA Key" screen, enter your network's password and press X, and then press the "Right" arrow.   Wireless passwords are case-sensitive, so make sure to enter the password exactly.  Doing so lets the PSP use the router's default settings.  This will confirm your network's name.  You will be shown a list of all of your settings. Make sure everything looks correct, then press the "Right" button on the directional pad to continue and press X to save your settings.  This will test your PSP's connection to the Internet. If you see "Successful" on the Results page, then your connection was properly configured., This will be used to access the configuration page:   Windows - Open Start, click the Settings gear, click Network & Internet, click View your network properties, and view the address next to "Default gateway".

 Doctors sometimes recommend soaking in warm water to relieve itching, pain, or discomfort associated with herpes outbreaks. You may find that aluminum acetate (Domeboro) or magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts) help relieve the affected area, although these are not doctor-recommended treatments.   Cleanse sores gently with soap and warm water. Keeping blisters clean may help speed healing. When the area is not soaking in warm water, try to keep it dry. If toweling the area dry after stepping out of the bath is uncomfortable, use a hair drier instead.  Cotton underwear is a must. Restrictive clothing and synthetic pantyhose, underwear, or pants can aggravate genital herpes symptoms, as these synthetic materials tend not to breathe as well as fabrics like cotton.  Although topical treatments are generally less effective than systemic treatments, they can sometimes be used to treat pain or discomfort.   Taking OTC pain medications, such as aspirin (Bayer), acetaminophen (Tylenol), or ibuprofen (Advil) is often recommended to help with pain.  In its natural state, propolis is resinous material collected from the buds of poplar trees, although it is often harvested from beehives. A 3% propolis ointment (Herstat or ColdSore-FX), applied to herpes lesions, may help heal lesions.In one study, propolis ointment was used four times a day, for 10 days, among 30 participants. Afterwards, 24 of 30 participants who used propolis during the study reported that their lesions healed, while only 14 of 30 participants who used a placebo reported that their lesions healed., Prunella vulgaris and Rozites caperata have both shown some promise in fighting herpes.Prunella vulgaris can be used in a hot water treatment to soothe and heal sores, while Rozites caperata may be ingested to help treat sores.  

soak the affected area in warm water, but when not soaking, keep area dry.  wear loose, breathable underwear and clothing.  if your ulcers are very painful, ask a physician about a topical anesthetic to apply to affected areas.  try an ointment containing propolis.  try the herb prunella vulgaris and the mushroom rozites caperata.

 Begin with a “process talk.” This just means to talk about talking – you don’t need to get into the details at this point. “Process talks” will get your partner ready for the information you want to share.Try saying something like, “I don’t really know where to start, but maybe you can just bear with me and listen? I’ll feel better about things when you know.” You could also say something along the lines of “There’s something going on in my life that I need to tell you about. Will you please listen and try to understand?”; , Your partner will probably want to support you however he can. But, he might not know what it is that you’re experiencing. Bipolar disorder can be confusing and paralyzing – especially when you’re in the down cycle. But it will be easier with a loved one standing beside you.Tell your partner how you’re feeling and what your symptoms are like, i.e. “You’ve probably noticed how my moods can suddenly change, Kevin. I’m high and energized one week, low and depressed the next.” Or, “I feel like I’m on an emotional roller-coaster, Julie.” Call the disorder by name. Share the fact that you have a diagnosis, if this is the case, so that your partner knows that you are dealing with a recognized mental illness. For instance, “My doctor thinks that I have bipolar disorder” or “I’m pretty sure that these are all symptoms of mania and depression. I think that I’m bipolar.”  , Every mental illness is different. Your partner might not know much about bipolar disorder or mental illnesses or even react very well to the news. You’ll better help him to understand if you can offer concrete instances of your symptoms – and how they’re affecting your lives together.You could say something about a specific time your partner will remember, i.e. “Do you remember last month when I was working so much that I barely slept for three or four days, Steve? I think that was a manic episode.” You can also highlight the impact of the illness, i.e. “The depression is the hardest part – I sometimes can barely get out of bed in the morning.” Don’t feel the need to disclose everything about the illness to your partner. Still, you shouldn’t make it seem less serious than it is. Stress that your disorder is keeping you from living a normal life and that it might be impacting your relationship.  Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness and can take a heavy toll on your life. You’ve probably already realized this if you’re talking to your partner. However, you may not have taken steps yet to get proper care. See if your partner will help you find and talk with a doctor or medical specialist, so that you can start treatment.Ask whether your partner can assist you in getting a diagnosis, for one. Can she take you to your regular doctor for a consultation, for example? If you’re feeling too low, can she perhaps make the appointment on your behalf?  , Your partner can also be closely involved as you start to get treatment and can help to make sure that you’re getting quality care. If you feel comfortable, ask him or her to help you prepare or even come with you to the first or subsequent appointments.Your partner might help you prepare for your appointments. Ask her to join you in finding out more about bipolar disorder in general but also about available treatments like mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and talk therapy. Your partner might help you come up with questions for the doctor as you prepare for an appointment, i.e. “Do I have bipolar disorder?” “Do I need to have tests?” “What are the best kinds of treatment?” “Will you refer me to a psychiatrist?” You can also ask your partner to share with the doctor what sort of symptoms you’ve shown., Once you’ve gotten started with treatment – whether with meds, therapy, or a combination of approaches – you might need your partner’s assistance to stay on track. People with bipolar disorder can need help in sticking to treatment, so ask for your partner’s encouragement.Your partner can give concrete support by reminding you of medical appointments or support group meetings. You might request that your partner keep an eye on your progress, too. If you find the idea useful, she can help you keep a treatment journal with records of your emotional cycles, setbacks, and victories. She can also remind you to take meds. People with bipolar disorder sometimes go off their medication, either from careful deliberation or on impulse. Ask your partner to keep you on track and, particularly if you’re unwell, to advise you to talk to your doctor and make a smart choice., People who are experiencing bipolar depression can be frozen by inertia, a lack of energy, sadness, and despair. You may need help in functioning normally or even in getting out of bed. Ask your partner for concrete support in being active and maintaining a daily routine.Depression can disrupt your routine and sleep schedule, which in turn can throw off your body and worsen your moods. Ask your partner to help you stick to a routine, especially during depressive episodes. This means includes getting up at the same time each day.Have her make sure that you stay active, too. While hard, it’s good for your mental health to stay motivated and do everyday things when you’re depressed. Your partner can do as little as encourage you to take a walk, for example, sit out in the garden, or help with errands and cleaning. You can also ask for emotional support, i.e. “Sometimes I just might need a hug and to hear some kind words.”  , People with bipolar disorder have a higher risk of suicide than the general population. This doesn’t mean you’ll have suicidal thoughts, but be aware of your moods and take any thoughts of death seriously. Tell your partner if you have even vague ideas of self-harm.Let your partner know if you are severely depressed, even if you haven’t had concrete thoughts of suicide. He can help you get in touch with a doctor, as a precaution, to do a risk-assessment. Take suicidal thoughts seriously and let someone know. Even infrequent and vague thoughts about self-harm can be dangerous.  Ask your partner to contact emergency services if you are having suicidal thoughts, especially if they are specific and you think you might be in danger of hurting yourself. Have your partner call 911 and get you to see medical professionals as soon as possible.Your partner can call 911 or take you to the nearest emergency room or hospital. You might also ask him to contact your medical team or other family members and trusted friends. Another option is to have your partner call an emergency suicide hotline on your behalf, like 1-800-422-HOPE or the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-TALK., People who are risk of suicide should have someone with them at all times. Your partner needs to stay with you at all times if you think you’re suicidal, at least until you can get proper medical attention. This is extremely important.Ask your partner to stay in the same room with you. You shouldn’t be left alone when having thoughts of self-harm. If your partner can’t stay, he should ensure that someone else is there to watch you. Your partner should also remove anything that you could use to hurt yourself. Ask him to get rid of any objects that you are associating with self-harm, like blades, sharp objects, pills, or cords.  

start with a “process talk.” disclosing mental illnesses like depression and bipolar disorder to a loved one is hard and you might have trouble getting started.  talk about your disorder.  give concrete examples of your symptoms.  ask for help in finding treatment.  invite your partner to appointments.  ask for support in following treatment.  let your partner know how she can support you at home.  say something if you have suicidal thoughts.  ask him to call 911.  don’t let your partner leave you alone. 

 This is one of the most common (if not the most common) methods teachers and professors use for curving grades. This curving method requires the teacher to find the highest score in the class and set this as the "new" 100% for the assignment. This means that you subtract the highest score in the class from the hypothetical "perfect" score, then add the difference to every assignment, including the highest-scoring one. If done correctly, the highest-scoring assignment will now have a perfect score and every other assignment will have a higher score than it previously did.   For example, let's say the highest grade on a test was a 95%. In this case, because 100-95 = 5, we would add 5 percentage points to all of the student grades. This makes the 95% score an adjusted 100%, and every other score 5 percentage points higher than it was. This method also works using absolute scores, rather than percentages. If the highest grade was a 28/30, for instance, you would add 2 points to the score of every assignment.; , This technique is among the simplest of the methods used to curve grades. It is especially useful for when there was one especially difficult item on an assignment that a large majority of the class missed. To curve grades according to a flat-scale curve, simply add the same number of points to each student's grade. This can be the number of points that an item most of the class missed was worth, or it can be some other (arbitrary) number of points that you think is fair.   For instance, let's say that the entire class missed one problem which was worth 10 points. In this case, you might choose to add 10 points to every student's score. If you think the class doesn't deserve full credit for the missed problem, you might also choose to only give out 5 points. This method is closely related to previous method, but it isn't exactly the same. Because this method doesn't specifically set the highest score in the class as a 100% maximum score, it allows for the possibility that none of the assignments receive a perfect score. It even allows for scores over 100%!  , This curving method mitigates the effect that a few very low scores can have on a student's grade. Therefore, it's especially useful in situations where a student (or an entire class) bombed a certain assignment but have since shown serious improvement and, in your opinion, deserve not to fail. In this case, instead of the normal percentage designations for letter grades (90% for A, 80% for B, etc. down to 50-0% being an F), you define a lower limit for failing grades - a minimum score that is higher than zero. This makes it so that particularly low-scoring assignments have a less drastic effect when averaged with a student's good scores. In other words, a few bad scores are less likely to drag a student's overall grade down.   For example, let's say that a student completely bombs his first test, scoring a 0. However, since then, he's studied hard, receiving 70% and 80% on his next two tests. Un-curved, he has a 50% grade right now - a failing score. If we set a lower limit on failing scores of 40%, his new average is 63.3% - a D. It's not a great score, but it's probably more fair than failing a student who's shown real promise. You may choose to set separate lower limits for assignments that are turned in vs. assignments that are not. For example, you may decide that, for failing assignments, the lowest possible grade is a 40%, unless it's not turned in at all, in which case 30% is the lowest possible score.  Often, the range of grades on a given assignment are distributed in a way that resembles a bell curve - a few students get high scores, most of the students score mid-range scores, and a few students get low scores. What if, for instance, on a particularly difficult assignment, the few high scores are in the 80% range, the mid-range scores are in the 60% range, and the low scores are in the 40% range? Do the very best students in your class deserve low B's and the average students deserve low D's? Probably not. By using a bell curve grading method, you set the class's mean grade as a middle C, which means that your best students should get A's and your worst students should get F's, regardless of their absolute scores.   Begin by determining the class's mean (average) score. Add up all the scores in the class, then divide by the number of students to find the mean. Let's say that, after doing this, we find an average score of 66%. Set this as a mid-range grade. The precise grade you use is at your discretion - you may want to set the mean as a C, C+, or even B-, for instance. Let's say that we want to set our 66% as a nice, round C. Next, decide how many points separate the letter grades in your new bell curve. Generally, bigger point intervals mean that your bell curve is more forgiving to low-scoring students. Let's say that in our bell curve, we want to separate our grades by 12 points. This means that 66 + 12 = 78 becomes our new B, while 66 - 12 = 54 becomes our new D, etc. Assign grades according to the new bell curve system.  When you have a very specific idea of the grade distribution you want, but the actual grades in your class don't fit, you may want to use a linear scale curve. This curve allows you to adjust the distribution of grades so to get the mean score exactly where you want it. However, it's also somewhat math intensive and it technically uses a different grading curve for each student, which some may perceive to be unfair.   First, choose 2 raw scores (actual student scores) and determine what you want them to be after the curve. For instance, let's say the actual mean score on an assignment is 70% and you want it to be 75%, while the actual lowest score is 40% and you want it to be 50%.  Next, create 2 x/y points: (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Each x value will be one of the raw scores you chose, while each y value will be the corresponding score that you want the raw score to be. In our case, our points are (70, 75) and (40, 50).  Plug your values into the following equation: f(x) = y1 + ((y2-y1)/(x2-x1)) (x-x1). Note the lone "x" without any subscripts - for this, plug in the score of each individual assignment. The final value you get for f(x) is the assignment's new grade. To clarify - you have to do the equation once for each student's score. In our case, let's say we're curving an assignment that got an 80%. We would solve the equation as follows:  f(x) = 75 + (((50 - 75)/(40-70))(80-70)) f(x) = 75 + (((-25)/(-30))(10)) f(x) = 75 + .83 (10) f(x) = 83.3 . The 80% score on this assignment is now 83.3%.       

set the highest grade as "100%".  implement a flat-scale curve.  set a bottom limit for f's.  use a bell curve.  apply a linear scale grading curve.

 There are many different types of service dogs, all trained to deal with different emotional and physical needs.Search online for service dogs who can help you with your daily needs. You can consult with a vet, doctor, or physical therapist for recommendations.   The American Kennel club offers a listing of approved service dog organizations.  Each organization will have a unique set of procedures for adopting a trained dog from them. You should contact as many of these organizations as you can to find a dog that is best-suited for your lifestyle and needs. Furthermore, many organizations have waiting lists, so you should factor time into your decision.When you contact them, you should ask:“How long is your waiting list?” “Do you offer training programs to the new owners to help them bond with the service animal?” “Why type of certification and documentation do you offer for the dog?” “How are the dogs trained? Are they housebroken? Crate trained?” “How much will it cost to buy a service dog from you?” “How old will the dog be when they are released to me?” “What are the procedures for adopting?”  , Once you have determined which organization you want to adopt from, you will normally have to fill out an application. You may be asked to do a background check before being placed on the waiting list.Once you have submitted the application, you will have to wait for your turn to receive a dog. In some cases, it can take up to two years to receive a dog.  It is very expensive to train a service dog. Some organizations do not charge for service dogs while others may request several thousand dollars to cover training and costs.Once you are given an estimate of the cost for your service dog, you can begin saving your money and looking for financial assistance.    The Assistance Dog United Campaign is a charity that helps raise funds so that eligible people can afford their service dogs. You may have some luck using a crowdfunding website, such as GoFundMe or YouCaring, to help raise the money.You can claim any expenses toward buying or taking care of a service dog on your taxes. 

locate a service training organization that fits your needs.  contact the organization.  fill out the application.  save up money to purchase the dog. 

 The only way you can proceed to the next level or dungeon in the game is by completing the one that precedes it. Paths will be blocked or enemies that are impossible to defeat will be standing in your way, stopping you from going to the next level without finishing the one that comes before it.   On the other hand, if you’ve just started the game, the first level will not be locked and can easily be accessed because there’s no other level that precedes it.; , The first thing you need to do every time you start a level is to find the treasure inside. Each dungeon or level keep treasures, like equipment or consumable items that you’ll need in order to complete that very same level, inside treasure boxes. These treasures can be found a few rooms from the entrance of the dungeons, so they’re not very difficult to retrieve.  After finding the dungeon treasure, the next thing you need to do is fight the mini boss. A mini boss is slightly stronger than a generic minion but is weaker than a Boss type enemy. A mini boss guards its own room, usually a few paces away from where you found the dungeon treasure. Mini bosses can usually be killed with just four to five strikes of your sword or whatever weapon required to defeat it.  Once you’ve killed the mini boss, it’s time to face the dungeon’s final boss. But unlike the mini boss’s room, the Dungeon Boss’s room is locked and can only be unlocked by the Boss Key—a large oddly shaped key. The key usually lies in rooms that you’ll venture right after you’ve killed the mini boss. Check for treasure boxes that you’ll find in these places to get the Boss Key.  The Dungeon Boss’s room is very easy to find since its door is the largest one in the level, is covered with intricate designs, and is placed deeper inside the dungeon. Use the Boss Key to open the room and fight the Dungeon Boss. Unlike the mini boss, which can be defeated by a few strikes of your sword, the Dungeon Boss is very tough and, usually, can only be defeated using the equipment or item treasure you found inside the same dungeon. Each dungeon boss is unique and requires a specific method to kill.   After killing the Dungeon Boss, a portal will appear that leads back to the outside world. Stepping inside the portal will teleport you back to the Overworld, ending the level.  

unlock the level.  find the treasure.  fight the mini boss.  find the boss key.  defeat the boss. 

 Leave your betta’s current container alone for now. Use a water conditioner (available at pet supply stores) to remove chlorine and other harmful substances from the fresh water.   Follow all directions provided with the water conditioner, and use the exact amount required for your tank or bowl size.; , Putting your betta immediately into water that is a different temperature can harm it.Let the container of fresh, treated water sit at room temperature for an hour so that it will be safe and comfortable for your fish.   Alternatively, you can mix hot and cold water from your tap until it is the same temperature as the water in your betta’s current container.If you follow this method, use an aquarium thermometer to make sure that the water in both tanks is the same temperature, and add water conditioner to the new water as instructed.  To do a partial water change, you will take some of the water from your betta’s container and replace it with some of the fresh, treated water. Using a clean scoop or something similar, remove 25 to 50 percent of the water in your betta’s current container.Leave your betta in the container as you remove the water.   To be precise, you can measure the water as you take it out. For instance, if you have a twenty-gallon tank, remove up to ten gallons measured using jugs or other measuring containers. You can also use a siphon hose to transfer water from your betta’s container to a bucket or sink. Once the water starts flowing, move the hose so it "vacuums" the gravel at the bottom of the tank, picking up fish waste, old food, and other debris.  Slowly pour fresh, treated water from the container you prepared into your betta’s current container until it reaches the previous water level.If the container is too heavy to lift and pour, use a clean scoop (or similar container) or siphon hose to add the water. It is fine to leave your betta in its container as you add the fresh water, but add the water slowly so that you do not disturb the fish.  Most experts recommend changing your betta’s water at least once a week.If for some reason your betta’s container becomes especially dirty, however, you may need to change it more frequently.  

prepare the new water.fill a large, clean container with fresh water.  allow the water to warm up.  remove some water from your betta’s current container.  refill your betta’s container.  repeat water changes frequently. 

 When choosing healthy proteins, salmon and tuna are your best options. These are rich in omega 3 fatty acids, which are great for heart health, as well as high in protein and vitamin D. When choosing rolls, look for rolls that contain salmon and tuna.However, just because a roll has salmon or tuna does not necessarily mean it's healthy. Watch out for high calorie ingredients, like cream cheese, for optimal health.; , Eel is a healthy source of omega 3 acids as well, but is often prepared in brown, sugary sauces. It's best to limit yourself to one eel roll when eating at a sushi restaurant. This will help you avoid extra sugar and calories., The little additives, the better. The fish found in sushi is very healthy, but additives can add unnecessary calories. Look for rolls that mostly fish, rice, and seaweed. Stay away from rolls with additives like cream cheese, tempura, and mayonnaise. Stick to mixtures that mostly use fish and vegetables., How meat is prepared can affect its health. When choosing meats, look for steamed, grilled, and raw options. These meats have not been tampered with as much, which means they will have less added calories from things like sauces, sugars, and oils. 

go for salmon and tuna.  limit your intake of eel.  opt for fish without added ingredients.  look for meats that are steamed, grilled, or raw. 

 In the US it is mostly in the northeast and Midwest, though it appears to be spreading along the Pacific Northwest coast. Be sure to protect yourself from ticks if you are in an area that is known to have ticks.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a map showing where active Lyme disease cases have been reported. You can see it here: http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/maps.html  Be especially cautious of ticks in the summer. Ticks are most active in the warmer months (April to September).; , Avoid areas that are wooded or brushy unless wearing protective clothing. If you are in wooded or brushy areas, walk in the center of the trail. Some ways to protect yourself with clothing include:   Wear light-colored clothing with a tight weave so you can see ticks on them. Wear shoes that cover your entire foot, long pants, and a shirt with long sleeves. Tuck your pant legs into your shoes or boots. Keep long hair tied back.  Tick repellents should contain 20 – 30% DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide) and should be used on all exposed skin and clothing. Always follow product instructions.   Make certain an adult applies the DEET on children, avoiding their hands, eyes, and mouth. Treat all clothing, boots, backpacks, and tents with products containing 0.5% permethrin. Keep this gear separate from untreated clothing and gear. The permethrin stays on the clothing through several washings.  After coming inside, remove and wash all clothing and washable gear. Dry clothing on high heat to kill ticks.   Bathe or shower as soon as possible. Use plenty of soap and water to wash off.  It is important to check under the arms, between the legs, behind the knees, around the waist, your pubic area, on the scalp, inside your belly button and in and around the ears for ticks. Have someone look at the areas of your body that you can't see. Remember, ticks are very small, so you may want to use a lighted magnifying glass.   Check your children thoroughly. Children between the ages of five and 14 appear to be at highest risk of Lyme disease, followed by adults, aged 45 – 54 years.Also check any non-washable gear for ticks These ticks can be very easy to miss. They can be roughly the size of the period at the end of this sentence.  Ask your veterinarian about any tick-borne diseases that are common in your area. Both dogs and cats, as well as any other furry pets you have, should have regular treatment for ticks. These tick treatments may include:   Products which kill ticks: these can include dusts, collars, sprays or topical treatments to apply or use directly on the animal. These include Fipronil and Amitraz. Tick repellents: these help prevent the ticks from landing but don’t actually kill the ticks. The most common type of tick repellents are Pyrethroids, including permethrin. Most dogs and cats are recommend to be on monthly prophylactic medications for both heart worm and ticks.  Check all your pets every day for ticks daily, especially if they spend a lot of time outdoors. Dogs particularly need to be checked for ticks. Dogs themselves can get tick-borne diseases and they can bring the ticks into contact with you., If you find a tick on your dog, remove it right away. If you are uncomfortable with this procedure, you can ask your vet to remove it.  Keep grass mowed, leaves raked, and brush cleared.   If you use firewood, stack it neatly and in a dry area.  Put in a three-foot-wide barrier between lawns and wooded areas. The barrier should be made of wood chips or gravel. Also make sure there is a nine-foot-wide barrier of lawn between the wood chip or gravel barrier and any area where people sit or play. This includes patios, gardens, and play areas.   Play areas should be in a sunny location. Ticks don’t like sunny areas.  If you live in an area where Lyme disease is common, check with a professional pesticide company to see if your property can be effectively treated with tick pesticides. These pesticides are also known as acaricides.  If you find a tick attached to your or anyone else’s skin, first of all, do not panic! Not all ticks are infected, and you can greatly reduce your risk of Lyme disease if you remove the tick within the first 24 – 36 hours.  Grab the tick by the head using a pair of pointed tweezers. The head is the part attached to the skin. Pull firmly and steadily directly outward. Don’t jerk or twist the tick.   Do not grab the tick by the body. If you do you may just detach the body from the head, leaving the head attached. If you leave the head attached to your skin, you may still get infected.  Place the tick in a small container of rubbing alcohol to kill it. Clean the bite wound with rubbing alcohol or with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Also clean the tweezers you used to remove the tick.  You are watching to see if a “bull’s eye” rash develops. If you develop the rash, or flu-like symptoms, you should contact your doctor immediately.   If you live in an area where Lyme disease is common and you think that the tick may have been feeding off you for more than 24 hours, call your physician to tell them about the tick bite. The Infectious Disease Society of America recommends preventative antibiotic treatment with doxycycline (one dose) for anyone who meets the following criteria:The attached tick is identified as an adult or nymphal I. scapularis tick (deer tick). The tick is estimated to have been attached for over 36 hours (this can be determined the degree of engorgement or time of exposure). The local rate of infection of ticks with B. burgdorferi (Lyme disease) is greater than 20 percent (these rates of infection have been shown to occur in parts of New England, parts of the mid-Atlantic States, and parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin).  In general, Lyme disease occurs in three phases, with a possible fourth. If you have been bitten by a tick recently, or you just live in a tick-infested area, keep on a lookout for these symptoms.The first stage usually occurs within days or weeks of the tick bite. These symptoms can be very mild, so they can be easily missed. These include:   Fever Aches Headache Fatigue Muscle and joint aches Swollen lymph nodes Erythema migrans (EM): this is a rash that resembles a target or “bull’s eye.” This rash occurs in about 70 – 80% of infected people. The center of the target is the site of the tick bite and can appear anywhere on the body. The center may be red and surrounded by a clear area. The clear area is then surrounded by the circular, moving or migrating rash.  These symptoms can show up weeks or months after the first, if the first stage has not been found and treated. The second stage involves nervous system and heart problems. Symptoms include:   Severe headaches EM skin rashes Arthritic joint pains Muscle and tendon pains Heart palpitations and irregular heart beats (Lyme carditis) Problems with short-term memory Facial paralysis (Bell’s palsy)  , There is a stage of Lyme disease that is estimated to occur in about 10% of all patients. It is often referred to as “post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome," PTLDS, or chronic Lyme disease. Symptoms include fatigue and joint and muscle pain. These symptoms can last for six or more months after treatment with antibiotics, which is the currently recommended treatment for Lyme disease.   There is some controversy about this stage. The controversy is not whether or not the stage exists, but what is the exact cause. It may not be from persistence of the Borrelia bug in the person despite treatment. It is thought to be from some other immunologic consequence, but it is not yet understood what the mechanism is exactly.  If your symptoms indicate Lyme disease and you are in an area where Lyme disease is prevalent, your doctor should test you for the disease. The CDC suggests that labs use a two-step blood testing procedure for Lyme disease. Your doctor should send your blood to a lab to get this testing., If Lyme disease is diagnosed, a course of treatment with antibiotics is started. These antibiotics may be doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil. They are usually given orally, though intravenous treatment may be needed in some cases.  

limit exposure to ticks.lyme disease is the major tick-borne illness in the us, asia, and europe.  wear protective clothing when going into wooded areas.  use tick repellents.  sterilize all clothing and gear after being in areas that might contain ticks.  do a full body check for ticks.  talk to your veterinarian about using tick-preventive treatments on your pet.  check your pets for ticks.  remove ticks quickly.  keep your yard trimmed and tidy.the goal is to limit the amount of places ticks can thrive.  design your yard to limit ticks.  spray for ticks if you are in an area that has a large problem with them.  don't panic if you find a tick on a person or pet.  remove the tick.  clean up.  keep an eye on the bite for the next month.  screen yourself, your family, and your pets for the symptoms of early lyme disease.  keep a look out for the secondary symptoms of lyme disease.  discuss with your doctor whether you might have chronic lyme disease if you experience the symptoms.  get diagnosed with lyme disease.  get treated for lyme disease. 

 If you want to get pregnant and are using any type of birth control, stop taking or using it when you decide to start trying to conceive. It can take some time to conceive after you stop birth control, so stay diligent.   Stop using condoms or spermicides as soon as you decide to get pregnant. Because these forms of birth control don’t use hormones, there may be no delay in getting pregnant. Stop taking your birth control pills or have any devices such as IUDs removed. Recognize that it can take up to six months for your cycle to become regular and for you to ovulate after stopping hormonal birth control.; , You’re most like to get pregnant when you are ovulating. From monitoring cervical mucus to taking your basal temperature, watching your menstrual cycle can help you detect ovulation, which may increase your chances of conceiving.Many smartphones offer apps that can help you track your ovulation.  A woman’s cervical mucus changes consistency depending on her cycle. Watching for differences in your cervical mucus may help you conceive more easily.Look for an increase in mucus and a change in consistency to thin and slippery around ovulation. Following ovulation, cervical mucous decreases, thickens, and is generally less noticeable.Be comfortable and extremely diligent when examining your cervical mucus to increase your chances of conceiving., Observe the “standard rule” that menstrual cycles average between 26 and 32 days for most women. Watching the calendar can help you figure out the days when you are most likely to conceive.Watch for changes in your cycle around day 14, which is the approximate day on which many women ovulate.Be aware that this can vary from person to person. Consider enjoying sex more often between days 8 and 19 of your cycle to increase your chances of getting pregnant.Keep a small calendar with you so you can track the days of your cycle.  Your basal body temperature, or your body’s temperature while fully resting, can increase slightly during ovulation. Take your temperature every day before you get out of bed in the morning to measure your basal temperature and increase your chances of conceiving.Use a thermometer specifically designed for taking basal temperature. You can get these at many pharmacies and medical supply stores.See if your basal temperature increases up to 1 degree Fahrenheit (.5 Celsius), which might indicate ovulation.Take your temperature right after you wake up and before you get out of bed as your baseline number. Make sure to continue measuring your temperature at the same time every day.Write your temperature down in a notebook and see if you notice any patterns.Most women are fertile in the two to three days before their temperature rises., If tracking mucus, days, or temperature feels like too much work to you, buy an ovulation predictor kit. These tests can predict ovulation or signal it before it happens.You can purchase an ovulation predictor kit at a pharmacy. For most kits, you will need to start using the kit on day 10 of your cycle, but check the instructions that come with the product to be sure. When it is time to start using the kit, you will urinate on the test stick to see if you might ovulating., They key to getting pregnant in most cases is to have sex. Aim to have sex a few times a week, which increases your chances of hitting one of your fertile days.Schedule sex with your partner if you find that you’re both busy. This might seem unromantic, but turn it into a date night or something that can help you get in the mood. Be spontaneous as much as possible to keep things fun. Have sex at least two to three times a week, which should be enough to hit one of your fertile periods.Have sex at least once a day near the time you ovulate to increase your chances of conceiving., Make healthy choices if you want to get pregnant. Maintaining a healthy diet and weight, exercising, and managing stress can increase your chances of conceiving and having a healthy pregnancy.Be aware that it can take you longer than normal to conceive naturally after 35. See a doctor if it takes you longer than 6 months to rule out fertility problems.Stick to a healthy and nutrient rich diet of about 2,000 calories a day, depending on how active you are.Incorporate foods from the five food groups.Aim to get 150 minutes of moderate cardio activity such as brisk walking and muscle strength training on two days of every week.Limit and manage anything that causes stress in your life.Avoid recreational drugs and tobacco products, which can prematurely age your eggs.Avoid or limit your alcohol intake as well. Studies have shown drinking can decrease your fertility.Take prenatal vitamins to reduce the risk of any pregnancy resulting in neural tube defects., If you’ve been trying to conceive naturally for six months or longer with no luck, schedule an appointment with your OB/GYN. She can run tests to determine if you have a fertility issue or recommend a specialist for high-risk pregnancies.Be open and honest with your doctor about what methods you’ve been using to increase your chances of conceiving. Take any notes you’ve kept on your cycle. Ask any questions you might have about conceiving or your chances for getting pregnant.  There are a variety of reasons that may prevent you from conceiving naturally including structural issues with either the man or the woman.Determining what is impeding your ability to conceive can help your doctor formulate a more effective treatment plan and may also help you get pregnant. Undergo any tests your doctor might suggest for you and your partner including:   Semen analysis Hormone testing Ultrasound of the scrotum (for men) or uterus and fallopian tubes (for women) Testicular biopsy Genetic testing Ovulation testing with blood Imaging tests such as hysterosalpingography or hysterosonography., If your doctor determines that something specific is impeding your ability to conceive, treat the disorder. After receiving your treatment, speak to your doctor about resuming attempts to conceive naturally or use other methods such as in-vitro fertilization.Some treatments for infertility include:   Antibiotic treatment for infections of the reproductive tract Medication or counseling for erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation Hormone replacement Surgery., The number of eggs a woman has decreases considerably after the age of 40. Your doctor may suggest taking medications to help restore your regular cycle and stimulate ovulation if your infertility is unexplained or other treatments haven’t corrected it.Take these medications to increase your chances of getting pregnant.Speak to your doctor about the best medication for you.She may suggest options such as clomiphene citrate (clomid or Serophene) or letrozole (Femara), which are considered safe drugs and are relatively inexpensive.Inject or ingest fertility drugs. They may cause nausea, insomnia, and headaches.Be aware that fertility drugs can result in multiple pregnancy or conditions such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, which causes the ovaries to become painful and swollen., If you’re still having trouble conceiving following treatment, consider using one of the many forms of assisted reproductive technology available today.From in-vitro fertilization to gestational carrier, ARTs can greatly increase your chances of conceiving or having a baby to 5-10% per cycle.Some of the following ARTs may be available to you:   In-vitro fertilization (IVF), which is the most commonly used ART.This requires collecting eggs and sperm from the woman and man and then fertilizing them in a dish in a lab. After fertilization, the embryos are implanting into the woman.Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), in which a healthy sperm is injected into a mature egg.Donor eggs or sperm. Although most couples will use their own eggs and sperm, if there are serious problems with either the eggs or sperm, you can opt to use a known or anonymous donor egg or sperm.Gestational carrier. If you have some physical issue that impedes carrying a pregnancy but not conceiving, you can choose to have the embryo placed in the uterus of a woman who agrees to carry the baby. 

stop any birth control.  monitor your cycle for ovulation.  observe cervical mucous.  watch the calendar.  track your basal body temperature.  use an ovulation predictor kit.  enjoy sex regularly.  maintain a healthy lifestyle.  see your ob/gyn.  determine any causes of infertility.  treat causes of infertility.  stimulate ovulation with drugs.  consider assisted reproductive technology (art). 

 Line up a knife with the pod and press down to cut it open, then repeat with the remaining pods. If you don't wish to cut the pods in half, you can leave them intact or simply cut off the tips.  Whether you chose to infuse brandy, bourbon, tequila, or another type of alcohol with vanilla, just place the beans directly into the container and close the lid. Shake well.  Since strong-flavored spirits take longer to pick up the more subtle vanilla flavor, the bottles need to be shaken so that the vanilla gets distributed. For a week after putting the vanilla beans in the container, shake it several times a day. In the second week, shake it once a way.  Vanilla extract made with spirits aside from vodka takes longer to infuse. Store it in a cool, dry place for at least three months.  Open the bottle and sniff it, then take a taste. If the extract has a strong vanilla flavor, it's ready to use. If you can only taste the alcohol, replace the cap and let the extract infuse for another few weeks before using.  

slit open the vanilla bean pods.  place the vanilla beans into the alcohol container.  shake the bottle.  store the vanilla extract.  determine whether the extract is ready. 

 If you decide to simply present the original artwork as a gift, feel free to use any size paper (or, if using paint, a literal canvas) that you like. However, for many of these projects, you’ll be scanning the finished artwork to your computer. If you decide on one of these, use paper that will fit your scanner. Also:   Be aware that changing the size of your scanned image may alter the image itself. For example, shrinking your child’s 8.5 x 11-inch self-portrait to fit a small canvas pouch may cause facial features to condense and blur together. Conversely, blowing up a smaller picture to cover a larger dishtowel may cause the blown-up image to appear pixelated. To avoid this, use paper that roughly matches the surface area of the item that it will be transferred to. Or, simply trim larger sheets of paper down to size with scissors.; , Again, if you intend to give the original artwork as a gift, this is less of a concern. However, for artwork that needs to be scanned and transferred, consider the dimensions of the item that it will be transferred to. If the item is wider than it is long, instruct your kids to orient their paper accordingly.   For example, if you’re going to iron your transfer onto a small wide pouch, you’ll most likely want a horizontal image to cover as much surface area as possible.  Of course, if you want to, give your kids free rein to draw or paint whatever they choose. But also consider instructing them to draw appropriate subjects for the occasion. Ask them to create a custom image that ties directly into the occasion and/or the recipient for a more personalized gift. For example:   If the occasion is a birthday, they could draw a party scene with cake and balloons. For holidays like Christmas or Hannukah, have them draw a Christmas tree or a menorah. For relatives like grandparents, aunts, and uncles, ask each child to draw a family portrait, or make it a group project with each family member drawing themselves.  If you’ll be giving the finished artwork as a gift by itself, skip this step. However, if you’re going to use it to decorate another item (or present copies of one image to more than one recipient), scan the artwork to your computer. Once scanned, crop, minimize, or otherwise edit the image to your liking and save the file.   If you don’t have a scanner, you can either use a smartphone or digital camera to take photos instead.Or, bring the artwork to a copy store to have it scanned and saved to a thumbdrive.  

determine how big your canvas should be.  decide between wide and long.  pick your subjects.  scan your artwork. 

 Remove any worries that you might have about the first day by being ready for the day. Have all of the books and stationery organized the week before, know your classrooms and the school layout (visit the week before if possible) and have all of your clothes washed and ready for the week ahead. By being well prepared, you can help yourself to feel in control of the things you can be in control of, and this can reduce feelings of anxiety.  Iron your clothes, match them well and have clean and tidy shoes. Groom yourself nicely, to have neat hair and a clean face. When you present yourself neatly, people make good assumptions and it gives you a boost of confidence.  Think about the good things ahead, such as making new friends, getting assigned new subjects and learning amazing new things. There will also be clubs, after-school activities, sports and school team activities for you to become a part of, allowing you to meet new people who might turn into new friends.   It's okay to feel nervous. This is normal and it's something that every person experiences when doing something new. Try to balance the nerves with some excitement about what is ahead for you in the new school session. Breathe deeply and slowly to help control any butterflies you experience at school during those first days.  It doesn't take long to get to know where everything is and to learn your new timetable. It may seem like a big deal to begin with but it can help to visualize the following week and weeks after, when you'll be very familiar with all of the places and it'll feel like a normal routine. Visualizing this can help you to feel more comfortable about the beginning., Try to stay relaxed and comfortable. The first days at a new school are about being observant, neutral and respectful. Be friendly to everyone, just saying hello and smiling kindly a lot. Nobody knows you yet, so it's fine for you to avoid lengthy or in-depth conversations and just stick to the standard pleasantries of introducing yourself and saying hello.  Don't wait for others to do this first. Many other people are shy too, and even if you feel really shy, it's a gesture of respect and kindness to reach out and just say hello. Remember that you're not being asked to give a speech or even have a long conversation, just to say hello for now, and to tell people who you are.   Don't be afraid to mention that you feel shy if the time feels right. Other people may have the same feelings as you, and many people may be understanding. You could say something like: "I am a little nervous about starting at a new school and I feel a bit shy. I don't mean to be this quiet but it's a lot for me to take in. I am looking forward to getting to know everyone and the routine soon."  , Look at the person in the eye when speaking. If you avoid eye contact, you can make the other person feel uncomfortable. By speaking clearly and being willing to make eye contact, then you give yourself a good chance of being listened to and of making some connections with others.   Don't wait for people to come to you. Instead, go up to them and ask if you can join in. If you wait, chances are that many people will get set firmly in their group early on and won't approach you.  Half the battle with shyness is worrying about what to say to other people. This can be dealt with even before you go back to school by thinking about what things to talk to others about and coming up with a quick rundown of who you are and what things you like to do. Other things to consider when you talk to others include:  Ask what their favorite band is. Discuss a movie or the weather. All that basic stuff.       Use humor. Are you funny? The best way to win others over is either to make them laugh, or be nice.       Make sure to laugh at other people's jokes, it helps them to feel appreciated and helps you each to feel comfortable.  Getting to know others slowly is a good way of ensuring that the people you think might become new friends are definitely people you'll be comfortable around. Remember that everyone is like you, wanting to make friends.  Your teacher will be able to suggest some activities and techniques to help you to feel more comfortable and at ease. 

be well prepared.  concentrate on good presentation.  aim to be confident, even if you're feeling nervous.  remind yourself that you'll soon be very familiar with the school, perhaps within a week.  act your natural self.  introduce yourself to other people.  speak clearly.  know what to say ahead of meeting people.  take your time to make good friends.  talk to your teacher about your shyness if it impacts your classwork or interactions within class. 

 Drink 8 glasses of water if you are an adult. For children, the amount of water depends on body weight. Water helps mucus in the lungs to become more liquid. Water or fluids helps mucus to be brought out of the lungs and the nose and mouth more easily. This leads to better breathing., Regular exercise and physical fitness training help our pulmonary cope with disease. In most individuals who exercise at sea level, the lungs saturate arterial blood with oxygen more effectively than those who don’t. This means, if there is breathing limitation due to exercising at high altitudes, or to having exacerbation of asthma or other types of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, those who actively exercise may have extra ventilation that can be called on.Walking, running, swimming, and cycling are all excellent ways to restore your lungs’ strength. Before you exercise, begin by stretching and bending. Each exercise session should last about 20 to 30 minutes. Stop if you feel short of breath or have palpitations., Smoking is known for being dangerous to health. It is even worse for you if your lungs have been stricken by pneumonia. One effect of nicotine is constriction of the terminal bronchioles of the lungs, which leads to airflow resistance into and out of the lungs. When you are already having trouble breathing, you certainly don’t want you lungs to become even more constricted.Nicotine also paralyzes the cilia, or the hair-like projections found in the cells that line the airways. Cilia help remove excess fluids and particles--paralyzing them will stop them from helping you remove excess fluids in your airways caused by your pneumonia. Another effect of smoking is the irritation from the smoke itself which causes increased fluid secretion into airway passages.  Even when you think you’re all good, you shouldn’t stop taking your antibiotics unless your doctor tells you to do so. People who suddenly stop taking these meds or who do not take their meds on time put themselves at risk for drug resistance. This means antibiotics may not be as effective as they could have been if you don’t follow your doctor’s prescription., Good nutrition helps fight illness and a good balanced diet can give you the vitamins and minerals you usually need. For a little boost, intake of multivitamins or a tablet of Vitamin C once a day may help your immune system.   Adequate amounts of vitamins such as A, B complex, C, E, folic acid, and irons such as iron, zinc, selenium, and copper are required. These vitamins and minerals act as antioxidants and help the immune system fight diseases, especially infectious ones like pneumonia. Zinc sulfate is helpful in the reepithelialization, or in the repair of the lining of your airways. Vitamin D and beta-carotene supplements can also boost your immune system. 

drink lots of water.  exercise regularly.  quit smoking.  take your antibiotics as prescribed.  get enough vitamins and minerals. 

 That's the first and most important step. You can do this on practically any bike that is the right size for you. Starting on a basic single speed bike with coaster brakes is usually best. Since you don't have to worry about shifting gears and front/rear braking sequences, these bikes offer an easily learning curve.; , There are many different types of bikes that offer a wide range of capabilities. If you live in a city, you probably want a bike that’s built for roads. If you live somewhere where you can bike on trails, then a mountain bike might be more your speed. Standard bikes. These are old-fashioned, single speed bikes with coaster brakes (pedal backward to brake). Good for leisurely riding around town if there are no serious hills or other obstacles. BMX bikes. Low profile bikes with 20 inch (50.8 cm), usually knobby tires. These are for "competition" biking on trails or courses. And have cable operated caliper brakes on the front and rear. These bikes are single geared bikes. Road bikes. This is a general term for traditional looking, and racing like bicycles designed for good performance on pavement. There is a wide range of options within this category. Road bikes can often be classified into two broad groups of racing/performance or touring.  Racing bikes are designed for pure speed with an emphasis on light weight, and place the rider in an aggressive posture. Touring bikes are designed for sustained comfort and carrying loads. They have heavier components for durability, mounts for rack and fender attachments, and have a more upright riding position. Road bikes traditionally have "drop" or "aero" handlebars. These handlebars allow the rider a range of hand placements for comfort or for achieving an aerodynamic riding position.   Mountain bikes. Bikes designed for off-road use, with compact frames, stable handling, clearance for wide and knobby tires, and higher handlebars for a more upright position. For hilly terrain, these bikes will generally come with low-range gearing. There are many types designed for specific purposes, such as downhill versus cross-country racing. Mountain bikes can be equipped with sophisticated suspension and disc brake systems. Mountain bikes are also very popular as all-around bicycles due to versatility. Tandem bikes. These bikes have an extra seat and set of pedals for two people to ride together. Recumbent bikes. These bicycles seat the rider in a "reclining" position with the pedals positioned forward, which is a more natural position requiring less flexibility than upright bikes. These bikes can be fitted with windshields for good aerodynamic performance. However, these are generally heavier and can't match the performance of upright racing style bikes.  If you intend to ride your bike on trails and unpaved roads, a mountain bike is a good fit. If you don't intend to ride on unpaved trails and live in a city, a road bike will be more efficient.   Racing style bikes will not be as comfortable or practical for casual riders. Depending on where you live, shops may be limited to mostly racing and mountain bikes. A popular middle ground that you may find is the "hybrid" style bike. Hybrid bikes often mix elements of both road and mountain bikes. Hybrid bikes typically have thicker wheels and a wider seat. Frames are usually fairly light and most use caliper hand brakes. When deciding on a bike that will work for you, ask yourself a few questions to get started. What will your average riding time be? How often will you use your bike? Are you getting a bike for fun or more for transportation? What have you ridden in the past? Being able to answer these basic question will give you a good picture of what kinds of features you need in a bike. If you plan to ride your bike to work everyday, you probably want more of a road bike that is fast and light. If you want a bike you can attach extra components to like a basket and ride around, a hybrid or cruiser might work. And if you plan on exercising and riding trails, then a mountain bike is what you’re looking for.  Bicycles will vary in price depending on what type you’re looking at, where you’re looking, and the quality of materials. Road bikes will be better for commuting and speed, but can get expensive depending on the quality of materials. Cruiser or hybrid bikes sometimes offer more room to add accessories like baskets and saddle bags. If you intend to mount a basket, saddlebags, or a baby seat, you will want to be sure the frame is compatible with these devices. Many bike shops have complete assemblies with these attachments already mounted. If you plan on attaching a lot of accessories, avoid bikes from big box stores. These bikes, while less expensive, don’t typically offer suitable construction for attachments. Because the materials aren’t as good, adding too much weight can cause your bike to break down or not perform. Think about how long and how often you plan on having and using your bike. If you are planning to commute to work most days, invest in a higher quality bike. While more expensive, higher quality bikes will last longer and are constructed with durable, lightweight materials that will make performance better and last longer.  Road and mountain bikes usually have gears and shifters, often operated by some kind of trigger. Bikes that can shift gears are very useful for most riders, especially in hilly terrain, or for high performance. Fixie bikes don’t have shifters, are lighter and faster, good for flat commutes, but require some skill.   Bikes that have gears let you adjust your pedaling effort to account for hills, wind, or your own fatigue. However, these systems also add significant cost, complexity, and weight. Many riders commuting on busy, mostly flat, streets who want speed choose a bike with a single gear ("single speed" or fixie bikes). Most bikes can be converted to a single speed. But unless the frame is designed for it, a chain tensioner will be required. A fixie is good for riders who want a minimal, fast bike. However, these bikes require practice and skill to get used to. Fixies don’t have freewheel so you have to pedal constantly to move. Single speed bikes are similar to fixies, except a single speed does have a freewheel and lets you coast.  Comfort on a bike goes beyond how you feel on the seat. Depending on where you’ll be biking and your average commuting time, you want a bike that makes you feel comfortable and in control. Cruiser bikes typically have a bigger seat and let you sit upright. Touring bikes allow for good carrying capacity and typically have drop handlebars for a more aerodynamic position. Road bikes also allow for an aerodynamic position but can be uncomfortable due to smaller, light parts built for speed over comfort.   Choose a mountain bike if you like going over large bumps and dirt. Many mountain bikes have at least a front suspension to improve comfort and steering control on rough surfaces. Mountain bikes can also be good for general urban riding, due to stability and for going over curbs and the like. Beginners may find mountain bike handlebars and controls easier to use. Choose a road or touring bike if you’re riding on mostly flat roads and terrain. These bikes typically have drop handlebars that allow for several hand positions and postures. Touring bikes provide more comfort if you plan on carrying a lot with you because these bikes are outfitted with the necessary mounting bolts for cargo. Touring and road bikes also offer different gears which help you change resistance if you encounter a hill or strong winds. Hybrid bikes are good if you find more comfort in sitting upright and want a more padded saddle. Tires on hybrid bikes are wider and more durable than both road and touring bikes, and can be ridden on different terrains with ease.  The fit of the bike is essential to consider. Different bikes have different dimensions for varying body types. Make sure the straddle height isn't too high for you. Mounting and dismounting should be comfortable and easy. Make sure you have a good reach to the handlebars. When gripping the handlebars, you want a slight bend in your elbow. You should be able to easily grip your handlebars without having to bend over too much, even on road or racing bikes. When riding you want to be able to keep your head up without straining your neck. If you’re reaching too far forward and looking at the ground, your handlebars are too far away from your seat. Frame size and seat height will affect comfort as well. Look for a bike that you can easily adjust the seat height on. You should be able to easily touch your feet on the ground and maintain control over your bike. While you can make adjustments to most bikes, you want to look for one that provides you with a good saddle position. You want your knee to be directly above the ball of your foot when your pedal is in the 3 o’clock position. This will provide consistent movement and make it easier on your knees. Check wheel size. Bikes come equipped with tires from 12" for children's bikes, up to a standard 26 or 28 inch (66.0 or 71.1 cm), for adults, and even higher for specialized racing bikes. Larger wheels may improve your speed, but if your wheels are too large for your body, riding will be more difficult.  If you can't get the bike shop to let you try a bike out, go to another shop, or borrow one from a friend. It is easier to get a bike that fits than to adjust and get acclimated to one that doesn't.   Ride the bike around the block to get a good feel for it. You should feel comfortable and in control at all times. Make sure you can easily reach the handlebars and all the components, like shifters and brakes. Test the gears and brakes. See how easy it is for you to shift gears and brake quickly. The bike should be responsive and shouldn’t take too much effort to adjust gears or brake on. Practice turning corners. You want to be comfortable with maneuverability. Some bikes are lighter than others and require more precision when maneuvering. If you don’t feel comfortable on the bike, try out other ones to find something that feels natural.  No matter the type of bike, there are different weights and materials in every one.  If you’re looking at a mountain bike, ask about the frame weight and how it affects performance. Though mountain bikes will typically be heavier than road bikes, you may find that for you, a heavier one will be harder to operate on the terrain. Check out the quality of the suspension. Full suspension mountain bikes are meant for serious off-road riders. You may not need the best suspension of you’re not solely riding over extremely rough terrain. Road bikes and touring bikes offer a lot of options in the way of frames and frame construction. The more performance-based options might use a carbon frame. Carbon is a very lightweight material that helps with performance and speed. However, carbon frames can be more expensive. The material and shape of your frame can affect your comfort and speed, but might not be necessary for your type of riding. While carbon is popular for its lightweight nature, it’s easily damaged. Aluminum frames may be heavier, but are more durable and often less expensive. Get a bike with the right tires for your needs. Thinner tires, often on road bikes, are fast and lightweight. However, thinner tires aren’t good on rocky terrain and puncture easily. Touring bikes have slightly thicker tires with more tread, which allows for more versatility in terrain. The tread also helps grip on wet or slippery roads.  This is especially true with derailleur equipped bikes, the components that keep your chain on your bike. Having a bike built professionally ensures all the nuts and bolts are installed and tightened correctly, as well as the accessories.   If you’re newer to cycling, you will have an easier time getting on the road with a professionally built bike. Bike shops will ensure that your bike is properly tuned and that the wheels are properly aligned. By getting a professionally assembled bike, you will also make sure that every component from the position of the saddle to any accessories has been outfitted for you. A bike shop will be able to take your measurements and tailor any bike to fit your body perfectly, allowing for the best, safest riding conditions.  

learn how to ride if you don't already know.  learn about the basic types of bikes.  think about your intended usage.  decide between quality and price.  know what types of terrain you’ll be biking on.  decide on your desired comfort level.  find a bike that fits you well.  test ride a bike before you buy it.  test the weight and materials.  buy or have your bike professionally assembled. 

 When you're in high school, get involved in your school's drama department. Some theater departments allow students to direct plays. If you can't direct, get experience doing every other aspect of theater. This will help make you marketable in addition to helping you get into theater college programs.Look into youth theater in your area. A lot of community theaters let teenagers take part in their productions. Look for any opportunities to get experience. Act in productions and work as a stage manager. Run the lights and the props. Find out what you're best at, and what you love to do best. Ask your teacher for a realistic assessment of your talents.; , Theater is, of course, highly literary, and the main part of a director’s job is to interpret a written text.If you want to make it as a director, you need to feed your passion for drama by immersing yourself in it. Reading will help you to develop your ideas and approaches while giving you a deep well of knowledge to draw on. By reading about the context of your favorite plays, you will learn much more about them, which will feed into your ideas about how to direct plays.   Read plays, novels, screenplays, and adaptations, as well as literary criticism, history, and biography.Take one of your favorite plays and try to develop a deeper understanding by reading around it. For example, if you love Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot, read some of his other plays and novels to get a fuller understanding of him as a writer. You can also read some biographies and literary criticism, as well as social or cultural histories about the time and place in which he lived and wrote. Ask yourself how this extra knowledge can inform your interpretation of the play. Imagine you are trying to explain a character to an actor, and write down some thoughts on how you would do this for practice.  If you want to be a stage director, you should go to the theater as much as possible. See as wide an array of plays as you can to broaden your knowledge and give you an insight into staging and production. Go to every kind of theater you can, from the best theater in New York to a tiny community or school theater in a small town. The more plays you see, the more knowledge and understanding you will have.See a variety of plays. See classics, experimental, children's, and musicals. Even if the play is terrible, you will likely learn something. Go see different adaptations of the same play. Seeing the way different theaters perform the same play - or plays by the same playwright or from the same period - can teach you a lot about directing. See plays in other countries. Translate plays from other languages if you can. This can give you a unique perspective on the theater world and performances.Many theater productions have question and answer sessions after some performances. Attend these sessions and ask questions, or listen to the playwright, director, and actors discuss their process., Directing is very hands-on and practical, but a director will have a bachelor’s degree in theater production or some related media or arts field.Decide which schools will be the best for your career goals and your financial situation.   Find a city with notable theaters and theater programs. Charleston, Boston, San Francisco, New York, and Portland are all great cities of the arts with good training programs. Think carefully about what you want to study, and speak to people in the departments you are considering. Directors include graduates in drama, English literature, music, creative and performing arts, and foreign languages. Other humanities topics such as history, philosophy, and psychology can all be a good foundation., If you can't afford a prestigious university, go to a state college with a thriving drama department. Although there will be some prestige attached to famous institutions, a state college with a very active department could be a great place to get lots of hands on experience in a variety of settings.   While at the state college, make sure to build your resume by participating in theater productions, summer institutes, community theater, workshops, and anything else you can find.  Some performing arts schools have master’s programs in directing, which can be excellent way to learn the skills if you studied something unrelated.With a bachelor’s degree, you can start a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) course. These can be highly selective, and will include extensive study of theory and criticism as well as practical skills.If you have a relevant degree and a reasonable amount of experience, graduate courses are certainly not essential, and can be very expensive.This could be particularly appropriate if your first degree is in a topic quite far removed for theater and drama.  Keep looking out for and attending workshops, drama labs, and short courses even after you graduate. This will help you to constantly develop and will introduce you to new ideas and new people all the time. The theater is always changing so refreshing your education regularly is a good idea., Directors acquire a lot of skills through experience and practice. When you are studying, you can work with your friends and fellow students to produce and direct plays. It will be a great chance to experience what it’s like to produce a play with no budget, and you will learn a lot about collaborating and improvising.Becoming a member of the drama society will also help to get to know lots of people who have similar interests.  Look beyond your courses for opportunities to become involved in theater in your city. One way to get an insight into how a theater runs is to work as an usher part time while you’re at college. You’ll come to know audiences and staff and maybe meet some people who can give you good advice.   You can also get involved in local amateur drama groups as a volunteer. With smaller community groups, you may find that you will be given more responsibility and more opportunity to contribute to all aspects of productions.  Try to get involved with local programs during the summer break. Ask your professors to help you find them. It doesn't matter what you do there; just get in and do something - acting, stage managing, handling props, lighting, set building. Do whatever and as much as you can.   Make a great impression on the people who run the program because you will need their recommendations later on. Look for opportunities with summer stock theaters.  Keep an open mind and try to get involved in all aspects. You will learn valuable lessons that you can take with you. Learning how to change a set, run lighting and arrange costumes are all skills that will help a director.As a director, you will be better able to communicate with all the specialist staff if you have some experience with what their work entails. At all stages of the game, tell everyone you are "learning to be a director," not "I want to be a director." Ask everyone in charge of anything to "teach me how to do that." People love that, and it shows the right state of mind. Be humble, but not shy or retiring. Show your passion without your ego.  To be a good theater director, you must love and enjoy being around actors. Meeting actors and talking to actors helps you begin to understand what role they will play in the theater production. Start to learn about the relationship between a director and an actor. Take this time to understand the creative process of an actor so you know what they go through every night.Consider taking acting classes. This helps you go through the same processes that actors will go through, so you can put yourself in their shoes.  One the main things that directors have to do is deal with people. You have to inspire them, but more important, you have to make people do what you want them to do. Sometimes, that means making people play roles they may be unhappy playing. Learning how to relate, talk to, and inspire people will help you be successful., There are plenty of organizations and networks out there for young aspiring directors. Being a member of a network will help you stay in touch with your peers and will make it easier to stay in the know about news and job opportunities.It can also be nice just to talk to people who are experiencing the same thing as you. You can join a relevant union, such as the Actor's Equity Union, to keep updated on news in the industry.  Many directors get jobs through networking and contacts. After college, move to Los Angeles or New York or another town with an active theater community. Visit the little workshops and theaters until you are able to land a job doing something. During this time, keep meeting people and making contacts. Keep a list of these contacts, and keep in touch with these people. This will help you as you start directing.Try to move up the hierarchy, and if you have acting talent, try to get parts. If not, continue stage-managing and learn all you can. Acquiring a broad range of experience is very helpful for your directing skills and can help pay the bills as you develop your career. Always be on the look out for a place at the next-best theater and try to move up the ladder in size, prestige, and quality of production.  Working as an assistant is a great way to get your foot in the door and experience what life is like for a stage director. If you respect a local director and would love to work for that person, write him/her a letter with a CV and some information about yourself. Say what you can bring to the table, and why specifically you want to work with this director.It’s possible that people will offer you unpaid work assisting as an intern. This can be great experience, but isn’t sustainable in the long term. As an assistant, you should be dedicated and enthusiastic, but keep in mind that you don’t want to stay an assistant forever. Try to keep your career progressing outside of your assistant job. While you should be committed to your director, be sure you don’t end up mimicking the director in your own approach. Don’t lose sight of your own voice and style.  The early career of a stage director is almost always going to very difficult and frustrating. Keep an open mind about work and think about what kind of roles could help you develop your skills and experience.   Investigate running youth workshops, or working on community theater projects. Look for any avenue to get experience and contacts. Bear in mind that it will most likely take years to become a full-fledged director with a reliable income, and that many people never achieve it., Playwrights are the creative brain behind plays. Start meeting playwrights, getting to know them, and talking about their work. Talk with them about their process, and get them to help you understand the play better.   The more playwrights you befriend and meet, the more your name is put into the theater world. Think about this as networking. Interacting with playwrights can help them get to know you so they can ask you to direct their plays., While making ends meet, don’t lose sight of your goal. Get together with some of your like-minded friends and peers and form a company. Don’t worry about the size, and remember that throughout the history of theater small companies have been essential. It is part of the essence of theater.Forming your own company is great experience to help you learn how to direct and how to work with the other members of a theater production., The next step is to put on a show which you direct, somehow, somewhere. Perhaps the theater with which you're affiliated will let you direct a little show, or perhaps you and your friends can rent a theater and present your own. Sometimes, directing children's plays can be a good step.   A children's play can be a lot of fun, and you might find you really enjoy working with kids and would like to develop these skills.  This is a crucial skill to develop. You will have to spend time fundraising for the production.You will also have to market your play to attract an audience. These are duties that go beyond working with the actors.   Learning about how a theater's finances function and the costs of staging a play are crucial parts of your practical education.  You will learn so much from the experience of actually putting on a play independently of your school or college. Analyze what you do and make notes on how to improve. Think about your interactions with everyone involved, from actors to set designers. One of the most important things you will learn is how to work with a large group of people, many of whom will be working for little or no money.   Understanding everybody's motivations for working in the theater will help you work together. Evaluating the financial results will show you how much the play really cost, and highlight if you need to do more work on fundraising or on attracting larger audiences.  Becoming a theater director is a long, grueling process. It's about finding and making opportunities and hard work, but also entails ability and a little but of luck. Be prepared for setbacks and struggles along the road, but keep your enthusiasm for the theater.   One way to do this is to keep discovering new things in the performing arts and exposing yourself to them. This will help you stimulate ideas, which will all contribute to the development of your own unique directorial vision. Go to conferences, workshops, and other events to constantly learn and expand yourself. Read specialist publications on new theater and criticism to refresh your ideas.  

be part of your school's drama department.  read everything you can.  go to the theater.  get a bachelor's degree in a related field.  consider alternatives to universities.  consider graduate courses.  don’t stop learning.  get involved in the university drama society.  get experience outside of university.  fill your summers with theater.  get to know as many roles in the theater as possible.  learn about the actors.  learn to deal with people.  join a network for young directors.  meet people and network.  work as an assistant to a director.  take work when you can find it, and be prepared for a struggle.  meet playwrights.  form a company.  put on a play.  learn to manage a budget.  learn from your successes and your failures.  don't give up. 

 Train another peon to go scouting for the enemy (he is always by a gold mine, but some mines are occupied by creeps).; , Just as the builders finish building, send them to the gold mine, but have the last one build another burrow, then send him to the gold mine.  Take one of the peons gathering lumber and have it make a war-mill real close to the trees. Now start upgrading your great hall.  Just as your hero and a grunt finishes training, send them to a green dot on the map close to your base. Have them focus on one creep at a time.   If you see any chests or books drop from the creeps when they die, right click on them. If it is a potion, only use it when you're low on health for health potions, or low on mana with mana potions.  When you're creeping, you should build one or two extra burrows.  By now, your town hall should have finished upgrading. Use a peon from the gold mines to build a bestiary and spirit lodge.   Summon a second hero at the altar of storms. At the bestiary, research, ensnare, war drums, and envenomed spears.       At the spirit lodge, research witch doctor adept training and shaman adept training. Also, train a few shaman and a couple witch doctors and a couple kodo beasts and raiders.       While doing this, upgrade your stronghold.  Now, with 2 heroes and 3 grunts, a couple raiders, a couple kodo beasts, a couple witch doctors, and a few shaman you can try creeping red dots.   Expand (clear out a gold mine close to your camp, build a great hall there,and train peons to gather gold and lumber).       Hunt for enemy expansions if you don't feel like creeping or if all the creeps near your side are gone. While doing this, you should build a few more burrows.  When the stronghold finishes, it's your choice if you want the third hero.   In the beastiary, train 3-4 wyverns.       In the spirit lodge, research shaman master training and witch doctor training, and if any of your units died (other than grunts), replace them.       Use a peon to build a tauren totem and research pulverize. After it finishes researching, train 3-4 tauren.  With all those units and 2-3 heroes and knowing where the enemy is, you should attack.   If the enemy masses towers, bring along a few catapults.       If you destroy all his towers but the screen doesn't say victory that means he either got a hidden building, a different base hidden somewhere,or a hidden expansion.       Use a goblin laboratory to reveal, or a far seers far sight ability to check out the gold mines. Hunt him down and wait for victory to appear on the screen.        

put two peons mining gold, one building an altar of storms, one building a barracks, and one building a burrow.  use your great hall to train six peons and set the rally point on the trees.  start summoning your hero and training a few grunts.  level up your hero.  try attacking an orange dot when you get about three grunts and a level 9-10 hero.  get an army.  do some more leveling.  further train your army.  attack. 

 It’s not necessarily the amount of sugary or acidic items you consume that’s a cause for concern. Rather, you should limit the frequency, or how often you consume them. Exposing your teeth to items like sticky candies, soda, fruit juices, or alcohol weakens them for up to an hour. You’ll want to limit the number of times a day your teeth come into contact with them.Eat some raw fruits, vegetables or other alkaline products to reduce the acidic environment created by sugar. Limit consumption of high sugar or acidic food and drinks to meal times. Wait to brush your teeth up to an hour after eating, since they’re slightly weakened after a meal.  Smoking irritates gums and encourages plaque buildup. Both of these contribute to bad oral health and gum disease exposing the gums to germs and reducing the flow of saliva. Chewing tobacco similarly increases the risk of periodontal, or gum, diseases like gingivitis. If you use tobacco, ask your doctor or dentist for resources to help you quit., There is evidence that gum diseases are somehow connected to other health problems, such as diabetes and heart disease. There’s only evidence of correlation, that there’s some relationship between diseases, but nothing that proves one causes the other. Still, the correlation shows that eating a well-balanced diet, exercising, maintaining proper oral hygiene, and getting recommended amounts of sleep are all related.People concerned with overall health are often more likely to take better care of their teeth and gums.  

limit sugary or acidic food and beverages.  stop using tobacco products.  maintain your overall health. 

 If you have trouble knowing what looks good and what doesn't, select one or two friends whose style you trust and ask them to accompany you as you shop. Ask them for their opinion on the clothes you try on.  Sometimes, all you need is time to yourself to avoid feeling pressured.   If you feel uncertain about your ability to put together an outfit, cut out a few pictures from a fashion magazine to act as a guide as you shop.  Stock up on a few style staples that can be matched with a variety of pieces.   Purchase a classic style of jean, such as a boot-cut leg in dark indigo. Look for a nice pair of soft material, lined dress trousers in black, gray, or dark brown. Consider a pair of simple khaki pants. Shop around for a good skirt. A simple knee-length, A-line black skirt works with a variety of figures and outfits. Buy a fitted cardigan sweater that can be thrown over tank tops and nice blouses. Grab a selection of neutral colored camisoles that can be worn beneath low-cut shirts, sweaters, and jackets.  Avoid overwhelming yourself—and your budget—all at once. Purchase one or two new pieces at a time and focus on incorporating those into your wardrobe before buying more.  If your closet seems drab, liven things up with a bright splash of color. Look for blouses, skirts, and dresses in a variety of bold colors and patterns.   Pair these bright pieces with well-fit neutrals from your existing wardrobe.  Try on trendy cuts that you are not accustomed to wearing to get a taste for what looks good and what doesn't.  Gradually build outfits with the new clothes and accessories you've collected.   Match a new free-flowing patterned blouse with an old pair of slacks and your favorite pair of heels. Accessorize with a new necklace and bracelet. Pair an old button-down collared dress shirt with a new skirt and a daring set of heels. Dig out an old favorite among the jewelry in your jewelry box. Throw a new, bright tank top beneath a white sweater settled in the back of your closet. Pair it with some classic jeans and head out with a new bag on your shoulder.  

shop with friends.  shop alone.  cover your basics.  introduce one new piece at a time.  add a little color into your style.  try a new trend.  put it all together. 

   The story could inspire the cooking activity. For instance, the poem "Chicken Soup With Rice" by Maurice Sendak is a great opportunity to make chicken soup with rice. Or, the desired cooking activity could guide your story selection. For example, if you want to make bread, the book "Bread, Bread, Bread" by Ann Morris is a great introduction to bread around the world. As always when selecting the book, be sure it is appropriate for your audience's development level. Be sure to read the book first so you are familiar with it, so you are confident. Understand firmly the connection. For instance, in "Chicka Chicka Boom Boom" by Bill Martin, Jr. and John Archambault, the action centers around a coconut tree. It also focuses on the alphabet. Create or research food activities that center around the literature. In the above example, consider: dissecting a coconut, coconut pudding, alphabet soup, sugar and coconut sprinkled alphabet cookies, and more.; ,   Be sure to know if there are any children with allergies, especially: peanuts, tree nuts, eggs, dairy, wheat, and shellfish. Check for other medical concerns: diabetes, lactose intolerance, sensitivity to food dyes, obesity, and so on. Check for cultural restrictions: Does any child keep kosher? Eat halal food only? Eat vegan? Some foods should be prepared with care for young children. For instance, children under age one should not eat honey. Hot dogs should be sliced horizontally for young children to avoid choking.  Depending on what you have available, you may need to modify your plans.   What kitchen cooking space do you have? Do you have an oven for making bread? Can a parent bring in an electric griddle for pancakes? Can you use a crock-pot for applesauce? How long will the activity take? A 1-hour library story time will not have the time to make a cake, cool it, and frost it. But a full-day daycare program will. How long will preparation and clean-up take? Be mindful of the time it takes to set up and clean up after the food is made. How many adults will be available? Will you be doing this alone, or with another staff member or parent? Do you have the ingredients? Some programs will have plenty of funds for cooking, while others may have nothing budgeted. (In which case, you may need to ask for donations). Do you have parents willing to help out? Many people love to cook, and will gladly share their expertise with children. Parents can lend equipment like skillets, crock-pots, cookie cutters, bread makers, blenders, and the like. If you are especially lucky, perhaps the owner of a restaurant, bakery or farm can offer a field trip. Make an ingredient list. You do not want to find yourself out of baking powder on the day of the activity. Have everything assembled in your cooking area before you begin the activity.    Keep it simple. If in doubt, choose the straightforward food activity over one that takes a lot of ingredients, time, or skill. Applesauce is often a better choice than apple pie, for instance. (Although both are good.) Never do a recipe with a group of children you have not done yourself before! If in doubt, do a test batch yourself before attempting it with groups of children. Sometimes, directions from the internet, books, and magazines turn out to be faulty or badly written. Safety issues are extremely important. Discuss this with children ahead of time. Cooking is a potentially hazardous activity, and must be treated as such. Some tasks are "adults only", such as using the oven or using a sharp knife. Some impulsive children may have great difficulty with this. Understand developmentally appropriate tasks for children to do. It is no fun for children to cook if you do all the work! What a toddler can do will be less than a first grader. Also, some children may have difficulty with fine motor skills, or coordination, so be aware of these students.  Younger kids can use pictures, while older children can sometimes read words. The children can read and follow the recipe by "reading" the picture cards. Children learn to grasp pre-literacy skills in this way.  Cooking can be a very hazardous activity, and children need to know safety rules to reduce risk.   Children must wash their hands every time. No exceptions. Be sure that they also rinse completely, as they sometimes forget. Children should not use sharp knives. However, you can allow then to use a relatively dull butter knife and see what amazing things there are that they can accomplish with them. Some things are adult or teacher-only. This includes things like using the oven, using the cook stove, or any potentially dangerous activity (safety). , What do you think happened when...? (This encourages problem solving and critical thinking skills.)  , (cooperation and taking turns)  , Alternatively, divide the food. Many children can each knead a bit of dough, cut and decorate a few cookies, or create their own miniature pizzas.  This encourages independence and self-sufficiency.  (pre-math)  , (sequencing, another pre-math skill)  ,, 

select an appropriate story introducing the cooking activity.  know your children's dietary restrictions.  consider your cooking resources.  select an appropriate food activity for making with a group of small children.  if possible, prepare "recipe cards" which are large cards with pictures of each step you are completing in the recipe.  be sure to use food health and safety procedures!,  talk about how to measure and why you are measuring (pre-math).  ,  ask open-ended questions of the children, such as what will happen when we put this in the oven?,  be sure each child gets a chance to "help" in the activity.  if you have a large group of children, more than three or four, plan to do the activity more than once, dividing the children into groups.  let the children help with the clean-up, too.  even though pre-school children cannot yet tell time setting a timer and asking them to watch the time with you, helps them to begin to develop a sense of time.  point out that you must complete the steps in a recipe in a certain order to get the desired end product.  when the recipe is complete, enjoy the food with the children and congratulate them on their creation.  ,  you may want read the story again as the children enjoy the food.  

 Decide between shorts or pants. Shorts might keep you cooler, but make sure to wear longer shorts as they will ride up. Pants would help protect your legs from possible vegetation and bugs. You can always roll your pants up if it's too hot.   You may also want to bring a hat, bug spray, and sunblock. Take a change of clothes with you. Some elephant trails cross or arrive at rivers in which the elephants might enter to play. Be prepared to possibly get wet. Leave anything you would care about breaking behind.; , When you ride an elephant, you use your feet to control the elephant's movement. Your instructor should teach you the commands before your ride. Be sure that you understand and practice the commands before you get on your elephant. Here are some basic commands:To walk forwards, press your toes behind the elephant's ears. To walk backwards, press backwards with your heels. To have the elephant lift its trunk, use your toes to push upwards. To have the elephant sit down, push downward with one of your heels. To have the elephant turn to the left, hold your left heel backwards and press forward with your right toes. To have the elephant turn right, hold your right heel backwards and press forward with your left toes.  Always approach the elephant from the side where it can see you. If you come at the elephant from the back or from the front, the elephant may not be able to see you. Many elephants are trained to attack anyone that approaches from the left so always approach from the elephant's right side.Pay attention to the elephant's demeanor as you approach. Signs of a happy elephant include flapping ears and a swaying trunk and tail. The elephant may examine you with its trunk to smell you or see if you have some food. If the elephant is staring at you intently, holding their trunk in the mouth, or blowing the elephant may feel threatened or anxious. Do not approach the elephant if you notice any of these things.  There are many different ways to mount an elephant. You can mount an elephant by using the front or hind legs, ears, trunk, or by stepping on the tusks.The instructor will have the elephant kneel so that you can mount. Grab the elephant's right ear and place your foot on its bent knee. Bend your knee and then swing your other leg over the elephant.Your instructor will give you directions before you mount and walk you through the process. Try to mount as quickly as possible. Your elephant may begin to stand up rather quickly., Sit as forward on the neck as possible and tuck your legs behind the elephant's ears. Keep your toes behind the elephant's ears so you can give instructions. Sit up straight but be flexible and move with the elephant. This helps to keep your balance.Remember, elephants sway as they walk, so do not be too rigid. If you feel like you're losing your balance place your hands on the elephant's back or neck to steady yourself.  If you have the option, choose to ride the elephant bareback instead of using a chair. An elephant's neck is much stronger than its back.Riding on a chair puts more pressure on the elephant's back.   Often times saddles are on put on incorrectly or tightened improperly which leads to chafing of the elephant's skin. Riding bareback also allows you to be closer and more intimate with the elephant.  You will dismount the elephant the same way that you mounted the elephant.Command the elephant to sit down. Hold on to the elephant's right ear, bend your knees and swing your left foot over the elephant's body. Place your leg on its bent knee as you step down.   Make sure the elephant is in the sitting position before you begin to dismount. Remember to maintain your balance as the elephant kneels down.  

wear light weight clothing.  learn foot commands.  approach the elephant from the right side.  mount the elephant.  sit up straight.  ride the elephant bareback.  dismount the elephant. 

 Your skin is your body's largest organ. It only makes sense to try to protect it from harmful elements. For example, you should wear sunscreen every day. Make it part of your daily routine.If you smoke, quit. Avoiding the harmful effects of cigarettes is a great way to prevent damage to your skin. Eat a healthy diet. Make sure to get plenty of vitamin-packed fruits and veggies. You should also drink plenty of water.  Your skin is your body's first line of defense against infections. Breaks in your skin can allow harmful bacteria to get into your skin. Taking care of the skin can have an important impact on your overall health. Make sure to keep your skin hydrated and clean.  Improving the health of your skin is also great for your mental health. Research shows that clear skin leads to greater confidence. When you feel better about yourself, you will naturally be more happy and relaxed. An increase in confidence can help you avoid symptoms of depression and anxiety. 

learn to prevent damage.  know the health benefits.  increase your confidence. 

 They can be metal or plastic. Some items may need a primer for real color to stick. You may have to use several coats of paint.; , Any number of weird or normal things can be found that would make a cool stencil. Choose something with a unique spacing or design. Even a toy railroad track or ping pong net might work. Or create your own out of cardboard or thick paper. If you want to make your own stencils, the best material to use is transparent overhead sheets because they are sturdy and reusable.  Pick colors you have around for a cheap redo of tins. Or if you want, buy something fresh for the job in the color scheme you want. Do not mix and match faux crackle paints with regular because they are not made to mix with other paints. They may refuse to dry and ruin your work when sprayed over or put under other paints. You will have enough variety without them, just using the stencils and your creative hand.  You may have to think backwards as you plan, so that the color you want in the design shape is laid down first. Make sure you cover any pre-printed writing on the can at this stage because you don't want to have to come back and retouch after your never-to-be-repeated-exactly stencil spraying has occurred.  This will affect your overall theme for the tin when completed. And sometimes it's hard to remember what color was used on the bottom if you do multiple items over multiple drying days. Don't be afraid of trying a new color or pattern. Just consider it all experimentation and have fun.  Have a light touch with the spray paint. Spritz in short blasts till you know how your paint adheres. Some paints go on wet and sloppy and need lots of level drying time. But don't worry if they run or bleed into a mess. Just go right over it with another color and call it your own special design. This is where you might need cheap gloves to prevent your stencil-holding hand from being sprayed.   Multiple stencils can be used on an item. If sprayed wet (before first coat has dried), do less spraying with the second color. Spraying when still wet creates a different effect as the colors swirl and affect each other. Of course, items sprayed can be left to totally dry between coats. 

find suitable objects.  find stencils with which to work.  choose your spray paints.  coat a solid cover of paint as the base.  consider whether you will spray one side or two sides at a time.  hold the stencil as close as you can to the item.  decorate with stickers if desired.

 Puppies are lots of work and if this is your first sighthound or even your first dog, consider adopting a retired racer. They are a very adaptable breed so when you bring the dog home it will be a blank slate.; ,   Keep the Greyhound on the lead and take him or her around the house. If you have glass doors, it's advised you tap the glass and let the dog (still on the lead) touch the glass with his or hers nose so they know not to run into it. Then let your new dog loose and don't make a big fuss because it could make the dog nervous. Let him or her sniff the dog bed and let them explore, if they want to go to you they can but don't go to them because they're still a bit nervous. After they've had a good look around let them out in the designated area and let them go to the loo, praise them and give them a treat for doing so.  For the first few days out and about, it's recommended that your new Greyhound wears a muzzle so he cannot nip at any other dogs or wild rabbits.     Greyhounds are not aggressive dogs and are the complete opposite, they are calm and affectionate. But because of their prey drive from racing, they can take off after wild rabbits or any other small animals. Greyhounds could nip other dogs in an act of self defence. In kennels, they're normally used to other Greyhounds for kennel mates but if another smaller dog of a different breed or a bigger dog runs up to the Greyhound without it being in his or hers eyesight it could spook your dog. If the other dog nips back, it could be fatal because Greyhounds' flesh is very thin.  This is probably one of the first nights ever for your dog to be alone, let him or her get settled 10-20 minutes before you go to sleep. For the first couple of nights, it would be better to keep a light on or a radio turned down so he or she does not feel alone. Your dog will soon realise that it's also their kennel as well as your home and will sleep like a log!  , It's very important to keep your Greyhounds health in good shape.   Groom him or her regularly and using a special dog toothbrush and toothpaste (Do not use human toothpaste. It's poisonous to dogs.) Brush their teeth once a week. It's very important, because Greyhounds do not drool. They keep all the saliva in their mouths which can quicken tar build up on the teeth and gums. It's also important to clean the dogs ears and clip their claws to make sure they're in no pain and can live life to the fullest. 

choose your greyhound.  once you have chosen the perfect dog for you, you will need to introduce him or her to your home gradually and calmly.  take them out and about.  help them create a healthy sleep routine.  keep them in good medical health.the rest is down to the owner, look after your new pal well and have fun living your life with your dog, don't and vets bills and other terrible things can pop up  

 To create a fire charge, you must have one piece of coal, one gunpowder, and one blaze powder.   Mine coal using a pickaxe, craft a block of coal into nine pieces of coal, or smelt coal using coal ore and any type of fuel. Coal can also be obtained from chest minecarts in abandoned mine shafts and stronghold storeroom chests.Obtain gunpowder by killing Creepers, Ghasts, or Witches, or search for gunpowder in dungeon chests. Create blaze powder by crafting a Blaze Rod picked up from a Blaze. A Blaze is a mob with yellow skin and black eyes that dwells in the Nether. Create a crafting table by gathering wood, constructing wood planks, and using the wood planks to build the table. , The instructions for accessing the crafting grid vary depending on your gaming system.   PC version: Right-click on the crafting table to open the crafting grid. PE: Tap on the crafting table to open the crafting grid. Xbox 360 / Xbox One: Press the X button on the controller to access the crafting grid. PS3 / PS4: Press the square button on the controller to access the crafting grid. ,,, A fire charge is a round, black ball featuring gray and orange swirls.  The fire charges can now be placed in the dispenser.Skip to step #15 to add the fire charges to the dispenser if you already own a dispenser. If your character does not own a dispenser, proceed with the following steps to craft a dispenser.  To create a dispenser, you must own seven cobblestones, one bow, and one redstone wire.   Obtain cobblestones from dungeons, strongholds, villages, or jungle temples, or mine cobblestone using a pickaxe.Craft a bow using three sticks and three strings in a 3x3 crafting grid.Place redstone wire by selecting redstone dust in the hotbar and right-clicking on the surface of a block. ,,,, The dispenser is a gray box that features a hole on the left side of the box., This will bring up the dispenser’s inventory menu.  The fire charge will be placed inside the dispenser.  The hole in the dispenser must be facing the space on which you want the fire to start.  Fire will shoot from the dispenser, and start a fire on the adjacent space. 

verify that your character owns the items required to make a fire charge.  navigate to your crafting table and position your character directly in front of the table.  ,  open the crafting table to access the 3x3 crafting grid.  add the gunpowder to the far left box in the top row of the grid.  ,  add the blaze powder to the middle box in the top row of the grid.  ,  add the piece of coal to the far left box in the middle row of the grid.  ,  verify that three fire charges appear in the box to the far right.  move the fire charges to the fourth, bottom row of your inventory, also known as the hotbar.  verify that your character owns the items required to make a dispenser.  navigate to the crafting table and open the 3x3 crafting grid as outlined in step #3.  ,  place one cobblestone in each box in the left and right columns, and in the box at the top of the middle column.  ,  add the bow to the middle box in the center of the middle column.  ,  add the redstone wire to the middle box in the bottom row of the crafting grid.  ,  verify that the dispenser is displayed in the box to the far right.  move the dispenser to the hotbar, then right-click on the dispenser.  move a fire charge over to the “fire charge” slot located to the left of the dispenser.  select the dispenser from the hotbar, then place the dispenser on a surface adjacent to the space you want the fire to occupy.  right-click on the dispenser. 

 Yes, you heard right: hairspray. It may not be the most glamorous cleaning agent (or it may be glammed-out, depending on your perspective), but some ink incapacitators swear by it. Here's what you do in order to try to remove the stain:   Douse a Q-tip or cotton swab thoroughly in hairspray. Quickly take the Q-tip and attack the spot of the foul. Apply leather cleaner and conditioner to the spot of the foul afterwards. Because hairspray can dry out leather, causing it to begin cracking, it's important to treat the leather after using this method. Repeat until the ink stain is removed.  70% isopropyl alcohol has worked for some leather owners in the past, although it's probably not a preferred method.Soak a Q-tip or cotton swab with a bit of rubbing alcohol before rubbing it on to the stained leather item. Because alcohol is also a drying agent, be sure to couple this approach with leather cleaner and conditioner afterward. Repeat if necessary.  Dampen the tip of a magic eraser and then rub it into the stain. Magic erasers contain a material called melamine foam, which helps remove tricky stains.Finish routine by applying a leather conditioner to the spot using a clean towel.  Some people have succeed at removing ink stains with the help of non acetone-based nail polish removers.Dab a little on a Q-Tip, rub the Q-tip against the stain, and finish with a nice bit of leather cleaner and conditioner to keep the leather from unnecessarily drying out.  

make use of hairspray.  try using isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol.  attack the stain with a magic eraser.  use nail-polish remover — the kind that's not acetone-based.

 Make sure to hand wash your shoes with a shoe foam cleanser or baking soda instead of throwing them into the washing machine. Using the machine can warp your shoes by putting stress on the arches and soles and can damage them over the long run.Suede and leather are both special types of shoes and shouldn't be hand washed.    To wash suede shoes, use a suede brush or suede eraser. To clean leather shoes use polish or saddle soap.  Dirt and debris not only look unpleasing, but they can also actually damage your shoes over a long period. Make sure to hand wash your shoes regularly and keep them clean. Instead of waiting for dirt and mud to harden from a hike or walk, make sure to clean your shoes when you get home., Water and humidity add to the damage on leather or suede shoes. To protect them from rainfall or other wet conditions, protect them by spraying a layer of water protector over them before going out into the elements.Leather protectant spray can be purchased online or at many retail shoe locations.  When you begin to feel your sole or heel getting soft or holes begin forming on the sole of your shoes, you should take them to get professionally fixed.Replacing the critical part of your shoe should be reserved for nicer, more expensive shoes because the work can range anywhere from $40 to $80. A cobbler can reinforce your heels, outsoles, and toes. Reinforcing your shoes will add another layer of protection to the most vulnerable pieces of your shoe. As an alternative, you can also purchase a sole protector and attach it to your shoe yourself to add another layer of protection for your shoe As a quick fix before taking them to a cobbler, you can apply a strong glue to hold your soles or side panels onto your shoe.Options, like Shoe Goo, is made specifically for the purpose of keeping worn shoes together.Taking your shoes to a cobbler for reinforcement can cost anywhere from $5 to more than $100., If you want your expensive leather shoes to retain their shape and look, you need to shine and polish them regularly. Apply leather lotion to your shoes with an old rag or t-shirt whenever you notice there is a scuff or scrape.Shoes that are worn more often should also be polished more often.   As a general rule of thumb, shining your shoes once a week will keep them looking new.A cheap and easy fix to hide scuffs and scrapes on black shoes is to use a black magic marker on them. 

hand wash your shoes.  keep your shoes clean.  spray your shoes with a water protector.  get your shoes professional fixed.  polish leather shoes. 

 Inscribed shapes come up fairly often on standardized tests like the GMAT and GRE, so it is important to know what they are. A square inscribed in a circle is a square that is drawn inside of the circle, so that all four vertices (corners) lie on the edge of the circle., The distance from the center of an inscribed square to each of its corners is equal to the radius of the circle. To find the length of s, we must first imagine cutting the square in half diagonally to form two right triangles. Each of these triangles will have equal sides a and b and hypotenuse c, which we know is equal to two times the radius of the circle, or 2r.  The Pythagorean Theorem states that for any right triangle with sides a and b and hypotenuse c, a2 + b2 = c2 . Since sides a and b are equal (remember, we are still dealing with a square!) and we know that c = 2r, we can write out the equation and simplify the equation to find the side length as follows:   a2 + a2 = (2r)2"', now simplify the expressions:  2a2 = 4(r)2, now divide both sides by 2:  (a2) = 2(r)2, now take the square root of each side:  a = √(2r). Our side length s for the inscribed square = √(2r).  In this case, the perimeter of the square P = 4√(2r). Because of the distributive properties of exponents, which tells us that 4√(2r) is equal to 4√2 * 4√r, we can simplify this to the following equation: the perimeter of any square inscribed in a circle with radius r is defined as P = 5.657r!, Consider a square inscribed in a circle with radius 10. That means that the diagonal of this square = 2(10), or 20. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we know that 2(a2) = 202, so 2a2 = 400. Now divide both sides in half to find that a2 = 200. Then take the square root of each side to find that a = 14.142. Multiply this by 4, and you will find the perimeter of your square: P = 56.57.   Notice that you could have found the same thing by simply multiplying the radius, 10, by 5.657. 10 * 5.567 = 56.57, but that might be hard to remember on a test, so it's better to memorize the process we used to get there.  

understand what an inscribed square is.  recognize the relationship between the radius of the circle, and the side length of the square.  use the pythagorean theorem to find the side length of the square.  multiply the side length of the square by four to find the perimeter.  solve an example equation. 

 (See the Things You'll Need section below). Set them out to make sure you have everything ready. When obtaining the items, consider the following:   Reuse and recycle. Use a piece of lace off of an old piece of clothing that has ripped or is just old and needs to be retired. Whatever piece of lace you choose, make sure it can spread from one side of the shirt across to the other, measuring horizontally across the shirt. Use any old solid colored shirt. Think ahead and decide in advance what color you want to spray paint. The colors should complement each other if you want it to look good. Keep in mind that opposite colors attract, dark colors look good on light colors, and dark colors work well with neons.  

gather the things you need to complete this project.

 Heat a large frying pan over medium heat. Pour in enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan. When the oil is hot, place a tortilla in the pan. Let it cook for 30 seconds, then turn it over and let it cook for another 30 seconds. Place it on a paper towel to drain. Repeat with the remaining tortillas.   If your pan is large enough, cook more than one tortilla at a time. Add a small amount of oil every few minutes, since the tortillas will absorb it as they cook.  One at a time, sprinkle each tortilla with a liberal amount of cheese. Roll up the tortillas and place them in an oiled casserole dish. Line them up close to one another so that they stay rolled. Continue until you run out of tortillas.  

soften the tortillas.  stuff the tortillas with cheese. 

 Find the size of your or another woman’s chest by wrapping your measuring material around the back over your shoulder blades, under the armpits, and across the fullest part of the bust.Ensure that you do not pull whatever material you’re using to measure too tightly around the chest. To measure for a bra, bathing suit, or other garment that calls for it, you will use this bust measurement along with the circumference just below the bust to find the cup and band size., Use your measuring material to find the length around your or another woman’s torso at its smallest point, which is your natural waist. Find this point by observing where the torso creases when bending side to side, and note that it will fall above the bellybutton and below the ribcage.Note that there is a difference between the natural waist and where the waistband may be worn on pants, skirts, or shorts. When clothing measurements call for a waist size, it refers to the narrowest part of the torso, the natural waist. You may want to take another measurement below the natural waist where you know you will wear a garment. Be sure to exhale and relax, or have the woman you’re measuring do so, before you take a waist measurement. The abdomen shouldn’t be enlarged with air, sucked in smaller, or otherwise in an unnatural or unrelaxed state., Wrap your measuring material around your own or another woman’s hips at their fullest point to determine hip size.   The fullest point of the hips is generally about 8 inches below the natural waist, but of course the distance varies from person to person. Take a few different measurements if you need to ensure that you find the widest point. If you’re taking the measurement on yourself, make sure your measuring material is level across your hips and rear end by observing yourself in a mirror.  Take the measurement of the inseam for a pair of pants by measuring along one leg from groin to ankle with the leg remaining straight.   This is best done on another person or with help from someone else to take a measurement on you. If you don’t have someone to help, you can also measure the inseam on a pair of pants that fits you well.The proper inseam for a pair of pants may vary depending on the style of pants and the height of the heel on the shoe worn with them., Use your measuring material to take any other measurements that a sizing chart or clothing pattern calls for.   Make sure that you always take a measurement from the fullest part or longest extension of a body part. Measure around the widest part of your arm or thigh, for example, and measure for the length of a sleeve with your arm bent to accommodate movement.It may be helpful to keep a piece of string or elastic tied around the natural waist, as it will be used as an endpoint for other measurements like front waist length, back waist length, and rise. 

measure bust size.  take a waist measurement.  measure hip size.  find the inseam.  take any other measurements necessary. 

 Most aluminum is actually aluminum alloy because aluminum itself is very soft. Keep this in mind when cleaning and avoid harsh chemicals and abrasive sponges, since you don't know which alloy is used.; , (29 ml) of vinegar, lemon juice or cream of tartar for small pieces of aluminum or aluminum cookware. For larger pieces, double or triple the amount and place aluminum inside a large pot. Bring to a boil and let it boil for 15 minutes. You can place many aluminum pieces inside the pot at the same time. 

scrub the aluminum with your ph-balanced cleanser to remove food, dust, dirt and grime.  mix a solution of water and 2 tbsp.  wash with your neutral cleanser, rinse well and dry.  

 Look for oregano oil that contain carvacrol, which is the active ingredient in oregano oil. Take one 50 mg capsule oregano oil three times a day while you have a URI or LRI. There are a number of products that you can buy in local stores and online. Make sure that you choose a product that:   uses organic (herbicide and pesticide free) oregano oil has been standardized to 75-85% carvacrol uses Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), sets of rules and regulations set up by the FDAhas a “Seal of Approval” from the Natural Products Association (NPA) or the US Pharmacopeia (USP), Add 2-3 drops of oregano oil to one tablespoon of olive oil and take by mouth once per day. You can also add 2-3 drops of oregano oil to food each day to get your dose of oregano oil.   Do not exceed this amount. Oregano oil can be toxic and even lethal if taken in large doses., Oregano leaf tea may also offer some medicinal benefits and it has far fewer potential side effects than the oil. If you do not want to risk the side effects that can come along with taking oregano oil, then you may want to try making some oregano tea instead.To make oregano tea, pour one cup of boiling water over one teaspoon of dry or fresh oregano leaves. Steep the tea for about five minutes. Then, use a strainer to remove the leaves from the liquid. Drink 1-3 cups per day until you recover from your respiratory infection.  

take oregano oil capsules.  mix oregano oil with olive oil.  try making a tea from oregano leaves. 

 If you have the space, a rustic, antique surface makes a quaint decoration and a convenient surface to arrange your towels on. Neatly pile your towels atop the chair, arranging them from largest to smallest.  Select either a low cabinet that sits on the ground or a high cabinet that must be nailed to the wall. By opting for a cabinet with a glass front, you can store your spare towels while simultaneously using them as decorations. Piles of crisp white towels can make your bathroom look cleaner and more refreshing, while piles of colorful towels can introduce contrast and vibrancy into the space.   You can also arrange the towels you presently need on top of the cabinet.  A bookshelf is functional and introduces a bit of visual interest into the room, since you would not typically expect to see one in a bathroom. Plus, a bookshelf pays homage to the idea of having “reading material” in the bathroom; though, whether you choose to include such material is entirely up to you. Pile your largest towels on the bottom shelves and your hand towels and washcloths on the mid-range shelves for easy access.  If you prefer to keep your towels out of sight, you can arrange them inside a more decorative surface, like a large, lidded wicker basket. You can also introduce a more functional piece into the room, like a window bench or vanity seat with built-in storage.  

fold your towels and sit them on a vintage chair, table, or bench.  put up glass-front towel cabinets.  use a small bookshelf if you have a large enough bathroom.  hide your towels away in a decorative or practical container. 

 Before you start looking for work, you need to make sure you are eligible to work. There are some federal and state regulations that say you must be a certain age to work, and others that restrict teens from certain types of jobs. Find out any rules in your state that would keep you from working. You may need to talk to your school to see if you need paperwork from them, as well.Individual companies may also have restrictions about age, so you want to pay attention to those requirements as you are searching and looking at applications. You don’t want to spend the time it takes to file an application if they only hire people who are 18 years or older.; , One of the most important, and often hardest, aspects of getting a job is learning to ask for it. Talk to everyone you know and tell them you are job searching. Ask them if they know of any good opportunities at the moment. It is great to ask adults like your parents, aunts and uncles, teachers, guidance counselors, and church leaders. These connections can be especially helpful in getting informal jobs like babysitting and lawn care.There is also always the possibility that you know people who work in places that would hire teenagers for assistant type work, filing, or cleaning positions. Once you have made the initial ask, and especially if the person tells you they will check into something, make sure to follow up with them later on to see if they found out anything.  A great option for teens is to go the more entrepreneurial route, rather than seeking jobs within a company structure. Going the self-employment route gives you greater flexibility in regards to how often and how many hours you work. When you are using your connections, pointing out your interest in self-employment is always a good plan.The types of jobs you have available in this area include babysitting (which people always need), lawn care (such as mowing, gardening, or even simple landscaping), dog walking, or car washing. You could even offer pickup and delivery services (if you can legally drive) for things like groceries, dry cleaning, or other goods. People have all kinds of things that they need done, and as a teen, you may be able to offer them lower prices than if they hired an adult. Don’t limit your thinking about what opportunities might be available.  Volunteering for a while can be a great way to start building relevant work skills that make you more marketable. If you have the time to put into volunteering somewhere on a consistent and long-term basis, you may be able to build enough rapport with them that you can move into a paid position.If the business or organization you are volunteering with starts looking to hire, you will be a better candidate than many others because you already know their environment and goals well.  In today’s marketplace, online and telecommute jobs are plentiful, and many are viable options for teens. If you have a skill for writing, there are many online platforms that allow you do freelance work. As long as you can perform the writing well, your age would not restrict you. If you have any website design or other graphic design experience, this can be another good option.In many cases, you will still need to meet specific qualification standards. Some freelance jobs will require you to have a degree, some experience, or be of adult age. When looking at potential opportunities, be careful to look for these requirements. Consider learning to buy and sell things online, such as comics, antiques, or other merchandise. You may need your parents to help set up an account for something like eBay if there is a restriction, but then you would be able to do the work of selling. Online working options could be great when you are still in school, because they rarely require you to work specific scheduled hours. You would have the freedom to work around your schedule, and do extra work anytime you have days off from school.  Although jobs may be limited by your age, many great opportunities still exist. Many restaurants, retail stores, or agricultural and labor jobs allow younger employees. Don't say no to these types of jobs, even if they would not be your favorite choice. At 16, this probably won't be your lifelong job, so be willing to do something that you may not love for a while to earn a little money and gain work experience.  

pay attention to age regulations.  use your connections.  make a job for yourself.  don't be afraid to volunteer.  pursue online opportunities.  be open to what is available. 

 Ask yourself if the salary is appropriate for the area you will live, your personal budget, and the amount of experience you have in your profession. You can figure out if the salary is appropriate by checking salary guides online, talking to mentors, or looking into what the company usually pays employees in your position. If you don’t think the offer is reasonable, you can try to negotiate the salary., If you’ve done your research and feel that the offer isn’t enough, then you can try to negotiate for a salary that you would be happier with. Negotiating salary is not unusual, so don’t feel shy about doing it. Come up with an amount that you think is realistic. Then, contact your potential employer by phone, email, or in person and tell them what your ideal salary would be. Keep in mind that they may say reject the offer. If they do, ask to take some time to make a counter offer or have a counter offer ready.Explain to them why you would be a valuable employee and why your ideal salary is reasonable. Tell the potential employer how you are genuinely interested in the job. Do not get defensive if the answer is no in the end.  Benefits should be considered along with salary. Benefits include important things like healthcare, but it also includes more minor things. Consider if your company has a gym, wellness programs, tuition reimbursement, and flexible hours. You can negotiate for your benefits when and if you negotiate salary. It’s also an option to negotiate for better benefits if the company is unwilling to compromise on salary.Benefits also include your 401(k), travel stipend, and paid time off. You should research what benefits are typical for someone in your position. Check out what the company’s competition offers as a benefits package if possible.  You shouldn’t ask to go on vacation right away, but it’s okay to ask what the vacation package is like. Consider how much vacation you will need to visit family or keep from burning out at work. If the offer has less days than expected, you could try to negotiate. Research what the typical vacation time is for someone in your position with your level of experience. Come up with an amount of vacation time that seems reasonable. Present this amount of time when and if you negotiate for salary and benefits., You may be offered the job directly on the phone. If not, you might be asked to call back. It's best to call the hiring manager responsible for interviewing you. You can go ahead and let them know that you intend to accept the offer, or have questions answered first before accepting.Don't leave a voice message indicating your acceptance of the job offer. If the hiring manager isn't present, leave a voice message indicating you'd like to talk to them about the job offer.  It’s important to express your gratitude for the opportunity. Let them know how excited or thrilled you are to have been offered the position. If you aren’t ready to say yes at this point in the call, expressing appreciation is vague enough to let them know you’re interested without committing before questions have been answered., Once you’ve had all of your questions answered, ask for the details of this conversation to be sent to you in writing. Ask them to write down the salary, benefits, start, and start dates that were discussed during the phone call. That doesn’t show your potential employer that you don’t trust them. It’s just a way to protect yourself in case the employer goes back on their word., It’s especially important to know this if you currently have a job that you need to give notice to. You can ask for a later start date if the date given doesn’t work for you. Don’t push it too much, though., You can address it to a different person if you are asked to, though. Make sure to write down your contact information and phone number at the end so the employer can get in touch with you.  Your future employer may already know that you've accepted the job, so don't ramble on about how good of a fit you are and what you can offer the company. They know this by now if they offered you the position. You should, however, include the following:Thanks and appreciation for the opportunity Direct acceptance of the job offer Starting date of employment  , Because it's sometimes tough to recall every single detail of the job before you've actually started it, you may need to ask your contact questions about your future employment. Don’t feel like you’re being annoying. This is expected by the employer. These questions can include, but are not limited to:   Questions about supervisors and/or who you'll be reporting to. Questions about work eligibility and/or visa requirements if accepting a job overseas.  This may not be applicable, but it is good to let them know if there will be any conflicts. You don’t want to surprise them after you’ve started the job. Be sure to remind your liaison of any dates you will not be able to work on because you scheduled something before you accepted the position.   For example, if you agreed to travel across the country for your grandfather's 80th birthday two weeks after your start date, inform your liaison that you won't be able to work those days because of a prior scheduling conflict  , Finally, you can say “yes” to the offer. Congratulations! You can say something like “I would be happy to accept this position.” Or, “I’m thrilled to accept the offer and become a team member.”, Make sure that your email is well-written and that you've proofread it for typos and grammatical errors. Even though you already have been offered the job, you want to make sure all your correspondence is professional. They likely won’t revoke the offer due to a few grammatical errors, but it could be embarrassing. 

accept the salary if you think it’s reasonable.  negotiate the salary if you aren’t satisfied with the original offer.  inquire about the benefits.  ask about vacation.  accept the offer over the phone first.  express your appreciation.  ask for a written letter.  ask about the start date.  address the email to the person who offered you the position.  make your email brief.  clarify any questions you may have had.  inform the contact of any scheduling conflicts.  accept the offer directly.  read over the email. 

 Make a plan to give up one kind of non-vegan food per week. Not only will this make for an easier lifestyle adjustment, but it will also help your body make the transition as smoothly as possible. Any sudden, drastic change in your diet would likely wreak havoc on your body, especially if you go from being an omnivore to being a vegan.   Listen to your body and be easy on yourself. Don't force yourself to completely change everything at once without guidance. You need to know how to properly substitute for certain elements such as protein and fats before thinking that a head of lettuce is all you need for the rest of your life. Start by removing meat, then eggs and cheese, then all dairy products, and then worry about diligence when it comes to ingredients lists (some get pretty sneaky).  It's much trickier for vegans than for vegetarians. You already know that you can't eat cheese because cows are exploited in order to generate the milk to make cheese, but did you know that even most cheese alternatives contain casein, a milk protein? Do your homework and read ingredient labels to prevent accidental consumption of non-vegan food.   You'll soon find that vegan websites will endorse certain brand name products. Knowing what to look for in the aisles will cut down on turning grocery shopping into a tedious chore.  It's a good source of both protein and calcium, and you can prepare it in a variety of ways. It takes a little getting used to, especially if you've never eaten much tofu before, but give it a chance.   Tofu, along with soy or rice milk and other non-meat alternatives, can be your best friends in the vegan world. Name a product, there's a tofu version of it. And it doesn't taste bad either!  , Most prepared foods are going to be off-limits, so whether you like it or not, you're going to have to learn to cook. It'll give you a greater connection with your food, as it can be exciting and very rewarding (your friends and family will dig it, too). Recognize that the taste and experience of your food is just as important as the practicality of implementing it into your lifestyle. Be creative and choose a variety of produce and products to avoid monotony and boredom.   There are many vegan cookbooks and free online recipes nowadays to provide you with inspiration. Investing of your best energies and mental capabilities to the daily task of cooking vegan meals can enhance your enjoyment and satisfaction of re-training your taste buds to savor new, even strange flavors. Who knew this path was going to be so exciting?  

ease into it.  know the difference between live foods and life-less products consumed as food.  learn about tofu (and soy products in general).  make time to cook. 

 Black is preferred to blue. Make sure you have pens that allow you to write neatly and legibly. A neat, clean application will be preferred to a messy one.  You never get a second chance to make a first impression, as they say. Regardless of the job, managers are more likely to hire someone who looks professional. Also, you may end up getting an on-the-spot interview, so you want to look how you would when going in for a scheduled interview.  It is always better, if possible, to take the application home so that you can take the time to fill it out neatly and have someone proofread your work., Employers sometimes include specific instructions on applications to see if applicants can follow directions appropriately. For instance, you may be asked to list information in a certain order.  In describing jobs listed on your model application, emphasize the skills and experiences that are applicable to the job you are applying for.For example, if you have worked as a cook and are now applying to be a sales associate, you might emphasize your work ethic and ability to multitask when describing your cooking job. You may want to get two copies of the application and fill out a practice one first, so that you can produce a clean draft after having used the first to craft your responses.  If something is not applicable to you, make sure that you mark it as “Not Applicable” or “N/A.” Otherwise, your potential employer may think that you accidentally skipped the question.  You don't want a hiring manager to think of you as someone who makes errors that should be easily avoided.   For checking bodies of text, reading backwards can catch spelling errors you'd miss by reading it normally. Make sure all information is accurate. You can be fired for presenting inaccurate information on your application.  

bring your own black pens.  dress in appropriate attire when asking for applications and when turning them in.  ask if you can take a blank application home.  read the application fully, including any special instructions.  use your model application as a template, but tailor your responses to the job.  complete every space on the application.  proofread everything that you have written. 

 Glitter nail polish comes in a variety of shades and sizes. You can go for bigger chunks of glitter or smaller chunks. For an robin's egg look, slightly bigger glitter chunks may work better., After your base coat has dried, simply paint over it with your glitter polish. Use slow, steady motions to avoid smearing your nails.         If you do not have enough glitter after one coat of polish, add another to add more speckles to your nails.  If you want, you can add a clear topcoat on top of your nails. This helps protect your nails. It can help your nail polish remain chip and damage free. If you do decide to add a topcoat, make sure the glitter nail polish has dried completely first.        

choose your glitter polish.  apply the polish to your nails.  set the look with a topcoat (optional). 

 Gustar is usually translated into "to like," but when you compare a Spanish sentence using "gustar" to its English equivalent, you'll notice a few differences.Example:  English: I like the food. Spanish: Me gusta la comida.   Even though "I" is the subject of the English sentence, it is not the subject of the Spanish sentence. This much is obvious because of the way "gustar" is conjugated. "Gusta" is the third person singular form of gustar, so "gusta" refers to a single thing or person—in this case, it refers to "la comida."  If "gustar" referred to the first person singular "I," it would be conjugated as "gusto."   Instead of "I like the food," a more direct translation of "Me gusta la comida" would be "The food is pleasing to me.” This version of the sentence places "the food" in the position of subject, as it is in the Spanish version of the sentence.; , An indirect object describes to whom or to what the action is done. In other words, the indirect object in "gustar" sentences refers to the person doing the liking.   In the previous sample sentence, "Me gusta la comida," the indirect object is "me." This is the term used for the first person singular indirect object and roughly translates into "to me." As such, saying "me gusta" would be the same as saying "it is pleasing to me" or "I like it."  , In every sentence using "gustar," you will need to change the subject of the English translation to the indirect object pronoun in the Spanish version.   No matter which verb tense you use in the indicative form, the indirect object pronouns will remain the same. Those pronouns are:First person singular: Me (to me) Second person singular: Te (to you) Third person singular: Le (to he/she/it) First person plural: Nos (to us) Second person plural: Os (to you all) Third person plural: Les (to them)    , Since gustar is almost always used to describe love for objects instead of people, you will almost always use the singular or plural third person conjugation.   For the present indicative:  Third person singular: gusta Third person plural: gustan   Example:  "You like the book" becomes "Te gusta el libro." "You like the books" becomes "Te gustan los libros."   The conjugation of "gustar" will always depend on the subject of the Spanish sentence, but this subject is the object of the English version of the sentence.  Now that you know which parts of the English sentence match up to which parts of the Spanish sentence, you should be able to correctly string the parts of the Spanish sentence together.   Example: Translate "We like the movie" into Spanish using the "gustar" verb.  "We" is the subject in the English sentence, so it will become the indirect object of the Spanish sentence. The first person plural indirect object pronoun is "nos." The object in the English sentence, "the movie," becomes the subject of the Spanish sentence, "la película." Since the subject of the Spanish sentence (la película) is singular, "gustar" needs to be conjugated into its third person singular form, "gusta."   When you piece the entire thing together, the Spanish translation would be: Nos gusta la película.  You can technically use "gustar" when discussing like for another person or people, but doing so implies physical attraction instead of platonic/friendly affection.The only time you would use either first person or either second person conjugation of "gustar" would be if you are referring to physical attraction toward yourself (first person) or toward the person you are speaking to (second person).  Example: "Me gustas" in Spanish means "You are pleasing to me" in English.   You may also use either the singular or plural third person form of "gustar" when describing physical attraction toward another person or group of people other than the person you are speaking with.  Example: "Me gusta ella" in Spanish means "She is pleasing to me" in English.  Oftentimes, the reader or listener will not know who the indirect object pronoun refers to when you use the third person singular form. As a result, you may need to add a little more to the sentence for the sake of clarification.This is usually done by adding "To _____" before the indirect object pronoun. In essence, you are referring to the same indirect object twice in the same sentence. This might seem strange in English, but it's normal in Spanish.  Note that the English "to" translates to "a" in Spanish.   Example: If you wrote, "Le gusta la cocina," the reader would have no way of knowing who the kitchen (la cocina) is pleasing to (le gusta). "Le" can refer to too many possibilities.  If Pablo likes the kitchen, you would need to precede the sentence with, "A Pablo." As such, the correct sentence would be: "A Pablo le gusta la cocina."    , Even when the indirect object pronoun can only refer to one specific person, you may still see the "A ___" construction.   In these instances, you are emphasizing the way the indirect object feels. For instance, someone saying "A mí me gusta la silla" would be emphasizing the fact that he or she really likes chair (la silla). Usually, this is done to draw attention to or contrast against other opinions.  When you want to talk about something that is disliked, you will need to add “no” before the verb “gustar” just as you would with any other verb. This “no” must also come before the indirect object pronoun.   Do not place the “no” in between the indirect object pronoun and the verb. Example:  English: I dislike the book Spanish: No me gusta el libro.  As it applies to "gustar," the present indicative should be used to talk about something that is presently liked.   Example: "We like you all," Nos gustáis.  yo: gusto tú: gustas él/ella/usted: gusta nosotros/-as: gustamos vosotros/-as: gustáis ellos/ellas/ustedes: gustan  , The preterite indicative is a past tense verb form. You should conjugate "gustar" in the preterite indicative to describe something that was definitely liked in the past but no longer liked in the present.   Example: "Raquel liked baseball when she was young," A Raquel le gusta el béisbol cuando era joven.  yo: gusté tú: gustaste él/ella/usted: gustó nosotros/-as: gustamos vosotros/-as: gustasteis ellos/ellas/ustedes: gustasteis  , The imperfect indicative is another past tense verb form, but it varies slightly from the preterite tense. Use the imperfect indicative of "gustar" when you want to describe something that was concretely liked in the past and may still be liked in the present.   Example: "You have liked us," Te gustábamos.  yo: gustaba tú: gustabas él/ella/usted: gustaba nosotros/-as: gustábamos vosotros/-as: gustabais ellos/ellas/ustedes: gustaban  , The conditional indicative tense describes something that is true only if another condition is also true. As it applies to "gustar," this verb tense suggests that something is definitely liked as long as another defined condition is also definitely true.   Example: "You all would like the book if you read it," Os gustaría el libro si lo lee.  yo: gustaría tú: gustarías él/ella/usted: gustaría nosotros/-as: gustaríamos vosotros/-as: gustaríais ellos/ellas/ustedes: gustarían  , When talking about definite future events and feelings, you would use the future indicative tense. Conjugate "gustar" in the future indicative to describe a like that will definitely exist in the future without needing any special condition.   Example: "They will like the news," Les gustará la noticia.  yo: gustaré tú: gustarás él/ella/usted: gustará nosotros/-as: gustaremos vosotros/-as: gustaréis ellos/ellas/ustedes: gustarán  

compare "gustar" to its english equivalent.  understand how indirect objects work.  change the english subject to a spanish indirect object.  choose the singular or plural form of "gustar.",  string everything together.  use caution when applying "gustar" to people.  clarify the indirect object when necessary.  emphasize the indirect object when appropriate.  place the negative “no” before the indirect object pronoun.  conjugate the present indicative.the present indicative is the primary conjugation and the one you'll usually need to learn first.  use the preterit indicative.  know the imperfect indicative.  learn the conditional indicative.  use the future indicative. 

 If your goal is invest small amounts of money online, your number one objective should be to find a broker with very low to no minimum required investment. Typically, brokers do require at least $1,000 minimum investment, but there are many that require less.   Currently, online brokers that have no minimum initial investment include TD Ameritrade, Capital One Investing, First Trade, TradeKing, and OptionsHouse."Small Amounts of Money" varies between investors. For investors with slightly higher minimums, E*Trade requires a $500 minimum, and Charles Schwab requires $1,000. Note that investing less than $500 is often not recommended, since there is typically a fee per trade of over $5, which means a $500 investment essentially starts off with a 1% loss due to the fee. You can avoid brokerage fees — and sometimes a broker entirely — by enrolling in a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) directly thorough an underlying company. Instead of receiving your dividends in the form of cash, the dividends will be automatically reinvested in the company for price appreciation and compounding. Some DRIPs are free, while others require a small fee.; , Unfortunately, investing online is not free, and brokers do charge a variety of fees. These fees are typically charged per trade (meaning you are charged once when you buy something, and once when you sell). These are known as commissions   Before opening an account, it is important to look at the fees charged on stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds). These are the three main types of investments that are appropriate for those investing small sums.Typically, commissions on stock transactions for small trades range from $4.95 to $10.00, whereas mutual fund commissions range from $15 to $80. ETFs are often offered commission-free by brokers. Since mutual funds and ETFs are important types of investments for those investing small sums of money, you should select a broker with low mutual fund fees, and commission-free ETF trading. Websites like Stockbrokers.com can be a valuable resource for comparing fees between brokers. You can use this website to look at all the brokers mentioned above to choose the one with the lowest cost.  Once you select a broker that has both low minimums (allowing you to invest small sums), and low fees for stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, you will need to choose an account type to open. While there are many types, the main ones to know are Individual, Traditional IRA, and Roth IRA.    Individual account. These are offered by most brokers, and they are standard accounts with no special tax privileges. This means any profits you make while investing and any income you earn from your investments will be taxed at appropriate rates.  Traditional IRA. A traditional IRA is a type of retirement savings account. Money deposited into a traditional IRA grows tax-deferred (meaning you don't pay any tax until you withdraw it), at which point it is taxed at normal income. With a Traditional IRA, you cannot withdraw money until you are at least 59.5 years of age, or you will receive a penalty. Contributions to a traditional IRA are usually tax-deductible.  Contributions to IRAs, whether traditional or Roth, are limited by income earned.    Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is also a type of retirement savings account. Like a Traditional IRA, earnings grow tax-free, except contributions are not tax deductible. The main benefit is that when you withdraw the money, you do not pay any taxes on your contributions (since they were paid on your income before you contributed). You can also withdraw your initial contributions any time with no penalty or taxes.Which to choose? The answer depends entirely on when you need the money and your goals. If you are starting a retirement account and do not plan on using the money until you are 59.5, the Traditional IRA may be appropriate. If you need the money sooner, a Roth IRA or individual account are likely better options.  

select a broker with low account minimums.  examine fees carefully.  select an account type to open. 

 Before you begin trimming your rabbit's nails, you'll want to make sure you've got everything you need. Failing to plan ahead can leave you with a squirming, uncooperative rabbit and a lot of scratches. Make sure you have:   a long-sleeved shirt and long pants for yourself (to prevent scratches) a towel to wrap the bunny in a flashlight (optional) to find the quick nail clippers - some people prefer to use human nail clippers for rabbits, while others prefer a special rabbit nail clipperstyptic powder, styptic pads, Kwik-Stop, or Cut-Stop to stop the bleeding if you cut too close; , It will be incredibly difficult to attempt to trim your rabbit's nails alone. You probably won't be able to hold the rabbit's body, find the quick, and trim the nails on your own without dropping or injuring the rabbit, so it's best to have someone assist you.Wrap the rabbit in a clean towel with his paws sticking out. Make sure your rabbit's head is not covered by the towel, as this may frighten him and/or affect his ability to breathe. Make sure your friend is sitting down while holding the rabbit. If the rabbit squirms out of your friend's hands and falls while she's standing, the rabbit may become injured., Once your friend is holding the wrapped up rabbit, you'll need your friend to get him into position. It's best to have your friend cradle him while also restraining him to protect your rabbit from squirming and/or falling.   Ensure that the rabbit is held in place in your friend's lap. Lay the rabbit belly-up and upside down, with his head pointed toward your friend's knees. Laying a rabbit upside down with his head lower than the rest of his body puts him into a calmer, "trance-like" state.Have your friend use one hand to support the rabbit around his chest. This will help reduce the chances of him squirming free while you work.  The quick is the term for the vein that runs through your rabbit's nails. The nail grows around and below the quick, so it's important to only trim the excess nail that has grown past the quick without damaging the nerves there.You'll need to find the quick on each nail before cutting. Take extra care not to rush this part, as cutting into the quick can be very painful for your rabbit and will cause him to bleed. Use a flashlight to find where the vein/quick extends to in each nail. This may be particularly useful if your rabbit has darker nails, which can make it difficult to find the quick with the naked eye.  Make sure you've identified the quick before cutting into the nail. Once you're ready, proceed with caution and make sure the rabbit is restrained.   Position the nail clippers in place just below the vein.Make sure you cut approximately two millimeters away from the quick. Clip firmly to ensure that the nail is cut all the way through. Otherwise, if you only cut halfway through, your rabbit may become frightened and start to thrash and squirm.  Once you've successfully trimmed one nail, you'll get a pretty good sense of how the rest of the nails go. Some rabbits who have grown up getting regular nail trimmings will get used to it and won't fight as much. Other rabbits may be frightened, and will need extra restraint and reassurance.   Make sure you get each of the nails on all four paws. Give your rabbit a treat when you're finished. He may come to associate the discomfort of nail trimmings with a treat, which could make him calmer in the future. Trim your rabbit's nails every four to six weeks to prevent injuries and overgrown nails.If you don't feel capable of trimming your rabbit's nails on your own, you can take him to a groomer or a veterinarian for instructions on how to trim the nails. You can also pay to have a groomer (or your vet) trim the nails for you.  Sometimes no matter how careful you are, you might accidentally cut into the quick. If your rabbit is squirming and struggling, it may be difficult to tell which nail is bleeding, but it's important to determine where to apply pressure and any styptic products (if necessary).   Try to restrain the rabbit. You should be able to tell which paw is bleeding, so while your friend restrains the rabbit's body you'll need to hold that paw and examine it.  Once you've determined which nail is bleeding, you'll need to put pressure on it. Just like a cut on a human, putting pressure will reduce the flow of blood to the site of the injury, which will help it clot and heal faster.   Use clean gauze, a clean paper towel, or both. Put pressure directly on the wound - in this case, the tip of the nail.Applying pressure may be enough to stop the bleeding for a small wound. If it keeps bleeding, you'll need to use a styptic product.  Styptic products stop the bleeding when you've accidentally drawn blood. If the quick was cut and won't stop bleeding from pressure alone, you'll need to apply a styptic product to the injured nail.If you're using a styptic powder, wipe away the blood and press a pinch of the powder directly into the tip of the bleeding nail. If you don't have a styptic powder on hand, you can improvise by using cornstarch or flour in the same way you would apply a styptic product. Some people find that gently pressing an injured nail into a bar of mild bath soap can help stop the bleeding.  Before you set your rabbit loose in the house or return him to his cage, it's important that you make sure the bleeding has stopped first. Leaving your rabbit unattended or placing him in his cage (which could cause his nail to get stuck in the grate and further injure it) can cause continued bleeding and additional injuries.Wait for about 5 to 10 minutes to ensure the bleeding has stopped before leaving your rabbit unattended or returning him to his cage.  Rabbits shed their coat every three months. Rabbits will try to lick their coats clean like a cat, but unlike cats they cannot vomit up hairballs. If you don't brush your rabbit regularly he may develop a hairball blockage in his stomach, which could cause him to starve to death.Brush your rabbit at least once every week. Choose a bristle or pin brush to avoid injuring your rabbit's skin. Brush in the natural direction of hair growth - typically, this will be from head to tail., Even if you groom your rabbit regularly, he may develop mats from time to time. Mats are tangled clusters of hair that begin growing together. This can cause irritations and infections on the skin below the mat. However, rabbits have exceptionally sensitive skin, and cutting a mat out with scissors could cause serious injuries to the rabbit.Check your rabbit for mats every time you brush him. If you find a mat, do not cut it out with scissors. Use a mat splitter or mat rake to tease out mats and detangle them without cutting.  While you're grooming your rabbit, it may be a good idea to check his ears for signs of infection. Ear infections are quite common among rabbits, so check on his ears periodically to ensure that your rabbit is in good health. If you observe any signs of an ear infection, it's important to take your rabbit to the vet as soon as possible. Common signs of an ear infection include:   pain/sensitivity to touch frequent head shaking redness/swelling, especially in the external ear canal thick, white fluid in the ear canal (which may sometimes be creamy in texture) excessive ear wax odor in and around the ear crusts forming around the ear canal digging at the floor and/or holding down the ear (a sign of pain) lack of appetite or interest in food patchy hair or loss of hair around the ears scaled skin around the ear canal  , A rabbit's teeth will continue to grow, just like his nails. Usually access to chew toys will help manage the growth of teeth, but occasionally an injury occurs that makes it difficult for your rabbit to chew his wooden toys or eat his food. Check his teeth periodically to make sure they're in good health.You'll probably only be able to see the front teeth (incisors) in your rabbit's mouth. The incisors should be even. That means both top teeth should be the same length, and so should both bottom teeth. Make sure there are no cracks in the teeth, no loose teeth, and no food or debris trapped between the teeth. If you observe any problems, contact your vet immediately, as your rabbit may need medical help.  The best way to prevent health problems is to be proactive in your veterinary visits. No matter what type of pet you have, it's important to ensure that he gets regular checkups and is able to get treatment for any ailments that arise.   Rabbits should visit the vet at least once every year. Older rabbits (over five years old) may need to see the vet twice a year.Let your vet know about any problems you've observed or concerns you have about your rabbit's health.  

gather your materials.  have a friend hold your rabbit.  get the rabbit into position.  find the quick.  cut the nail.  repeat the process.  identify the bleeding nail.  apply pressure.  use a styptic product.  make sure it's stopped bleeding.  brush your rabbit's coat.  detangle mats.  check the ears for infection.  examine the teeth.  schedule regular veterinary visits.

 Mineral extraction usually occurs at some time in the future as equipment and employees are often scheduled years in advance. If you do not start mining or drilling operations before the expiration of a lease, then all rights to the property and the minerals reverts back to the owner.Oil and gas have the ability to cross property boundaries underground. Some states require drilling companies to specify how oil and gas royalties will be shared among adjacent property owners., There is usually no guarantee that gas or oil will be present, so it would be to your advantage to pay a smaller amount for a lease rather than purchasing outright that will cost more. A lease gives you the right to test the property for minerals., Speculators buy the property with the goal to sell the mineral rights to another company who will do the actual production. It is an opportunity to acquire valuable property from individual owners and sell those properties to mining companies for a higher price than what you paid., In an option transaction a property owner is offered a small amount of money today for the option of buying the property at a certain price before a specified date in the future. You would then quickly try to find someone who will pay an even higher price, purchase the property from the owner, and then sell the buyer your mineral rights. If you fail to pay the specified price by the expiration date of the option, the property owner keeps the option payment., Companies such as Patriot Royalties do all the purchasing of mineral rights and the mining. Investors receive monthly income, and you don’t pay taxes on 15% of the production from a well.   Like other assets, oil and gas royalties can be bought, sold or transferred. The royalty income lasts for as long as the well produces, which may be several decades.  Most mining and drilling activity is regulated by state law. These laws may restrict extraction or require additional expenses, so make sure you are familiar with all regulations relating to extracting the minerals. Also, consider that laws may change or new laws and regulations may be passed which impact your ability to extract minerals.   Note that if you are merely receiving royalties and are not the majority owner of the mineral rights, you have no say in the production schedule. If the majority owner decides prices are too low, they may cease production at any time, which will stop the flow of royalties.  

determine the advantages of buying vs. leasing mineral rights.  lease rather than purchase gas and oil rights.  purchase the mineral rights as a speculator.  purchase mineral rights as an option.  invest in oil and gas royalties.  familiarize yourself with local and state laws. 

 To get the egg out of the bottle using this method, you will need baking soda, vinegar, and a plate. This method uses a chemical reaction to increase the air pressure inside the bottle. The increased air pressure will push the egg out of the bottle.You need about 3 tablespoons of vinegar and 2 tablespoons of baking soda for this. The plate is just used to catch the egg. You can also do this over a sink if you’d prefer.; , Pour the vinegar into the bottle, taking care to avoid the egg itself. Exact measurements aren’t necessary, but three tablespoons should be more than enough. Keep the bottle upright during this step., Again, exact measurements aren’t necessary, you just need to add enough baking soda to react with the vinegar. Swirl the bottle to make sure the baking soda and vinegar mix together and start reacting.The baking soda and vinegar react together to form a carbon dioxide gas. As the gas continues to form, the air pressure inside the bottle will increase.  Immediately after swirling the bottle, flip it upside down so that the egg is blocking the mouth of the bottle. Try to avoid pouring out the baking soda and vinegar mixture.Once the pressure inside the bottle gets high enough, you should see the egg get pushed through the mouth of the bottle onto the plate.  

gather the necessary materials.  add 3 tablespoons of vinegar to the bottle.  spoon 2 tablespoons of baking soda into the bottle.  turn the bottle upside down and position over the plate. 

 Paul says in Cor. 13, "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres." To see how loving you are, try doing a self-assessment and ask yourself if you are all these things. Are you patient? Are you kind? Do you not envy? etc.   Also one of the greatest commandments is to love others. "Greater love hath no man that this; that he lay down his life for his friend." Jesus set the example for us of how to love by dying for us. The Bible says, "We love because he first loved us."; , It is impossible to feel perfectly happy everyday. Life is hard sometimes, and it has a way of making us down at times. But joy is different than happiness. Joy is more like a subdued peace or calm. It is a feeling that everything will be ok despite what happens.   The Bible says, "The joy of the Lord is your strength." The more that you are able to have joy, and not let yourself be depressed, the more strength you will have to tackle life. Happiness and joy often times are a choice. We can't control what happens to us, but we can control whether or not we will let things steal our joy. Don't let things steal your joy. Learn to stay relatively happy with life no matter what happens.  We also can chose to stay at peace no matter what happens. The Bible says that we are not to "take offense." We can chose to let things get to us, or we chose to not let them. Don't let people get under your skin. Don't let people affect you so much. Learn to stay at peace no matter what.   Recognize that God will "work all things together" for your good. The more you are able to trust God, the more you will be able to stay at peace. Also there is the verse, "Do not be anxious for anything but in everything, by prayer and petition present your requests to God and the peace of God that transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." We are to have peace in Christ. We are to let him "lead us beside still waters" and "restore our soul." God does not want us to run ourselves ragged. He wants us to rest in Him. To be still and know that He is God. The main way to truly have peace is to follow God's commandments. The Holy Spirit will convict us when we stray and this will keep us from being able to have peace. So "fear God and keep his commandments" and you will have His peace "that passes all understanding."  , Don't rush people. Don't demand that they do things quicker etc.   We are to have patience with other people even when they hurt us. We know that God is still working on all of us so this means not having unrealistic expectations of others. We are to have grace and peace with ourselves and others. The more we have patience with ourselves, the more we can with others. Sometimes we are our own worst enemy. We need to recognize that, even though we are saved, we still battle with the flesh. None of us are perfect. "If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us." Recognize that you will sin, that it is a fact of life, and you will then be able to have more patience with yourself. Spiritual growth is a process. Also recognize that others will sin against you. It is inevitable. But God will give you the strength to be patient with others and forgive them.  Be polite. Say please and thank you. Don't interrupt others when they are talking. Really, really listen to people. Don't be loud and obnoxious. Be quiet and humble.   Kindness is the opposite of being rude. It is "to do unto others as you would have them do unto you." It is esteeming others as better than yourself. It is respecting others, valuing them, protecting their feelings. It is being gentle with the others and not being quick to judge them. It is trying to always say things that will build that other person up. "Let your conversation be always full of grace" Paul said. Kindness is speaking with grace to others. It is having a soft heart. It is being compassionate with others as Jesus was. Remember to be kind to everyone you interact with today and people will see God in you. A great quote is, "Preach the gospel at all times. Use words only when necessary." How do we preach the gospel at all times? By being kind to others.  Try to be good. No one can be perfectly good except for God, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't still try. To be good is to follow God's commandments as best as we can. To be good is to be in right standing before God and others. To be good is to be above reproach. To have a good name. To have a good character and reputation.  Here are some practical ways to be faithful to others: Be dependable. Be on time. Stay committed to your spouse. Be committed to your friendships. Stay in touch with your parents and siblings etc.   Jesus said, "Let your yes be yes." We are to do what we say we are going to do. We are to follow through on commitments. We are to say what we mean and mean what we say. We are to not be flaky or halfhearted in our commitments. We are to be like a rock or an oak tree. The world is generally scattered and can be all over the place, but Christians are called to be firmly planted and rooted in Christ and in His word. We are to be different. We are to be faithful to others and to God.  Don't be easily angered; be slow to anger, as God is. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Learn to be submissive when you need to. Be gentle with other people's hearts and feelings; treat them the way you would want to be treated.   Gentleness is like how one must interact with a young child. There is a quote, "In order to treat everyone in your life better, picture them as a young child or an elderly person." Having this mentality would make us much more gentle with others. It would make us more gracious and kind and humble in our interactions. To be gentle is to not be proud, to not insist on your own way. It is to be soft with others. To be tenderhearted and kind.  Don't believe Satan's lies that you can't control yourself. Any Christians with the Holy Spirit has the ability to control themselves.   Self-control is often the one that most Christians struggle with. It can range from our eating habits to the thoughts we allow ourselves to think. It can be related to activities we choose to do etc. The key is to not let ourselves be mastered by anything. Good things can become idols when we do not have self-control with them. A good way to grow in your ability to have self-control is by fasting. Fasting is the best way to keep your body in check and to learn to say no to your body. It trains you to not give in to every desire that you have.

 Remember, though, to consider the flow of energy and the flow of physical spaces throughout the house. Consider incorporating feng shui principles elements in your design overview.; , Basically each room should be designed by the primary users of the room and the focus should be on filling the space with the look, feel, and objects that provide pleasure and a quiet feeling of "rightness" for those individuals. Some possible designations which might make sense in your home:    For one family member - The room will be used, primarily, by one member of the family. Other family members and friends might visit the room daily or weekly to visit, convey messages, clean, remove clothing for washing, and similar activities.  Essentially, the room will be an individual space and should be arranged and decorated in according to the tastes and desires of that individual. Provide a place where visitors can sit down and feel at home if this function is in the vision for the room. Give primary voice to the individual who will claim the space as their own. Examples of such rooms might be the bedrooms, kitchen for the chef of the family, laundry room for the designated clothes care person, the study for dad or mom or kids, the garage, the shed, the sewing room, the greenhouse, and other similar rooms which are mostly used by one individual family member.    Shared by family members - This could include a bedroom shared by siblings or mom and dad, a family room or den, the dining room or breakfast nook, and similar rooms around the house.  The design should strive to make all individuals who use the room feel comfortable. Each individual should be a participant in picking the elements which provide comfort and should have the right to veto arrangements or items which make them feel uncomfortable. Some family members might not be too keen on having a stuffed elk head across the room or might have a personal objection to a proposed design element.    For guests - Keep things open, interesting, and inviting.  Special use rooms - Included here might be an exercise room, computer room, game room, home theater with surround sound, video or sound mixing room. These should meet the special needs of your family or individuals as well as remaining open, warm, and inviting.  The feeling that is evoked when you enter a room will be a combination of the visual and audio. Primary elements are the overall lighting, be it natural sunlight or mood lighting, spot and task lighting, room color, furniture placement, sound dampening or masking, and the audio experience.  Provide plenty of well-organized storage so that everything is at hand and the room stays naturally decluttered. , Angle chairs and couches so they are about three feet apart.

Strewing herbs used as a dry potpourri or simmering on the stove are warm, inviting, and subtle.  Avoid putting your things on those sitting spaces (don't throw your jacket or keys onto an open chair, for example). Add an ottoman so someone can prop their feet if they'd like. Keep a blanket nearby, or put a throw on the chair so a person can use it if they get cold.  Use lint rollers often. Remember that some people are allergic to pets.

 Avoid the use of a detergent, as this can damage the hair cuticle further. Maximize your use of protein sources to provide polymers to help repair damaged hair fibers. Consider using avocados and eggs as thickeners and polymer sources. Use mild emollients like shea butter or coconut oil.  Make sure your ingredients are blending well. If you are using an emollient that is solid at room temperature, warm it up first. Add your thickeners, scents, and any additional botanicals you would like to add to the conditioner.  Add vinegar or soapy water drop by drop to acidify or basify the conditioner. Use pH paper to measure the pH of the conditioner. Make sure it falls within an acceptable range of 5.5 to 7, trying to hew closer to neutral.  Spread it evenly throughout your damp, untangled hair, from your tips toward your roots. Cover your head, and let it sit for approximately 20 minutes. Heating the conditioner can help spread it and help compounds in the conditioner bond with your hair.

gather your ingredients.  blend your ingredients in water using a blender or food processor.  adjust the ph of your conditioner.  apply the conditioner.  rinse thoroughly.  store or dispose of excess conditioner. 

 A recent addition to Bangkok transport, the sky train was built to combat the intense traffic situation. If you are out on the street during rush hour, always opt to travel in the sky train. Covering all the major stops in the city, the sky train will take you to your destination in just a fraction of the time that you would spend of the road. The Disneyland space-agedness feeling that it provides makes your journey on the sky train just as interesting as the attractions in your destination. Your bird's eye view of the city will give you a glimpse of the many hundred vehicles crawling their way through the heaviest congestion. Breathe a sigh of relief that you are not down there! The real cherry on the top of Bangkok's sky train are the ticket prices. Cheap in price and soaring above traffic and pollution, there is absolutely no reason to not choose the sky train.; , If you cannot fly above there is a way down below: the mass rapid transit (MRT), Bangkok's subway system. This subway is pretty much an underground version of the Sky train. In fact, it reaches a number of regions in the city that the sky train does not. There are stations located everywhere and several can be found in close proximity to a number of Bangkok Serviced Apartments as well the famous Anantara Baan Rajprasong Bangkok Serviced Suites. Again the biggest blessing of the MRT is evading the heavy traffic overhead. Since prices for the MRT are just as cheap as the sky train, it is again another sensible option during Bangkok's rush hour.  Covering the whole Western Edge of the city, this is an excellent mode of transportation to truly appreciate the authentic Bangkok atmosphere. The breeze is heavenly, the water is sparkling, the backdrop is picturesque and the price is dirt cheap.  These three-wheeled rickshaws are perfect for evading traffic as they somehow manage to squeeze their way from one lane to another, getting you to where you want to go. Tuk-tuks come in handy when you have arrived at your stop via Sky Train or MTS and still have substantial distance to cover within the region. Fortunately or unfortunately, tuk-tuks have little regard for traffic rules and hence it does not hurt their conscience to jump lines and disregard cues. While this can make for a scary or dangerous ride, it will get you where you're going, and fast.  This is the fastest and perhaps the most exciting way to get around the busy streets of Bangkok. Clad in orange and purple vests, these taxi drivers are readily available to whisk you to your destination. Able to literally squeeze their way through the nastiest traffic jams, this can be a huge help during Bangkok's rush hour.  

use the sky trains.  take the mrt.  make an adventure of your travels with the chao phraya river boat.  travel shorter distances in a tuk-tuk.  take a motorbike taxi.

Attempt to avoid follow-up questions by colouring in as much truth as you can., Get inside the head of someone listening to your head. A good liar uses the same tools as a good communicator. Empathize with your listener and anticipate what he wants to hear. Learn what your listener knows and identify his interests and schedule to avoid any missteps in your story that may trigger any suspicion., Lying can make you nervous and scared. You may not notice yourself fidgeting, stuttering, or breaking eye contact. People can pick up on your non-verbal cues so try to limit gestures that aren’t already natural to your personality.Some people talk faster than normal or give too much eye contact to overcompensate for a lie. Rehearse in front of a mirror or a friend to get the most natural delivery you can.

Avoid overly repetitive information as you speak naturally.Liars may probe with repetitive information and their spoken words may be weaker at the start and end of a statement as they try to read their listener to see if their lie is being believed. Repetition may be difficult to read especially if using a cellphone as coverage may become spotty and cause repetition.  Cultural context may dictate how you utilize pauses in your delivery. However, if you use a pause, it may come off as regrouping to deliver a lie. Saying something like, “That’s a good question” may come off as you delaying to gather your thoughts as you commit a lie.Both honest and deceitful people use pauses in speech so this will be a difficult factor to detect without proper context.  Keep consistent. Depending on how big of a lie you tell, it may be hard work keeping everything in order. Remember every detail you lay out even if it is not asked of you. Make sure not to give different information to different people., You must commit to your lie. Any wavering makes it obvious that you’re lying. Lying may feel unpleasant as fear and guilt set in. Your body language and facial expressions may give away your emotions as you want to get the lie over with.

Lying is not a socially acceptable activity so it’s okay if you don’t get any joy from what you’re doing and find it difficult to commit.  If you are being accused of a lie, turn the table and manipulate your accuser. You may ask questions like “Why were you there, do you not trust me?” or “I’m sure you don’t want your friends hearing what you’ve been up to either”., Politicians use this technique to drive people away from other issues. People are uncomfortable accusing others so any chance they have to change topics may be seen as welcomed relief. For example, if a politician is asked about his views on the economy, he may drive the conversation to immigration. Similarly, if you are being accused of missing curfew, you may move the conversation to your brother driving without a license., Avoid responsibility from your lie by softening or even erasing anything you’re being accused of by admitting to things that your accuser will find satisfactory.

If you spread yourself too thin, you’ll have a harder time giving anything 100 percent of your effort.Try to focus on no more than three goals at a time.  Doing your best is about pushing your own limits, not trying to measure up to someone else’s achievements. Be honest with yourself about where your abilities are right now. Set goals that make sense for your current skill level.For instance, if you’re new to running, don’t expect yourself to be able to run a six-minute mile right away. A better first goal would be to run a mile in under 10 minutes.  Believe in your ability to work hard and build your skills, even if that means making mistakes sometimes. Commit to challenging yourself as you work towards your goals.The opposite of a growth mindset is a fixed mindset. Someone with a fixed mindset views their skills and abilities as inborn traits they can’t control or improve.  Turn each goal into a series of smaller goals. Then make a list of action steps you need to take to achieve each small goal. To keep yourself motivated, create daily or weekly milestones to work towards. For example, if your overall goal is to learn a new language, you might break the goal down into steps like mastering basic greetings, comprehending the spoken language, and speaking fluently. Each of these smaller goals will have steps within that you must complete.  

think about what you want to achieve and why.  choose your projects carefully.  know what you’re capable of.  adopt a growth mindset.  break down your goals. 

 Remove one of the bass drum heads and place a soft material such as a pillow or blanket inside the drum. The material must slightly touch both heads in order to achieve a muted sound. Once you've replaced the head you removed, re-tune the drum. The pillow will deaden many of the bass drum's overtones, resulting in a quieter, more muffled sound.   Music stores also sell specially designed muting pillows for bass drums. These pillows come in a variety of weights and sizes, allowing you to adjust the level of deadening in the drum.; , Tom and snare drums can be deadened using plastic O-rings. These rings are placed along the top of the drums and help absorb some of the vibrations created when a drum is struck. As a result, the sound created by these drums will ring less, offering a more manageable sound.   Drum gel may also be used in a similar fashion to O-rings. These are small adhesive gel packs that can be placed on the toms and snare to mute the drum. Other DIY options for muting the snare and toms include covering portions of the drum with fabric such as an old shirt, heavy duty tape (such as duct), or gum!, Mute pads are placed entirely over the top of the drums (or cymbals) and almost completely deaden the sound of the drums. This makes mute pads ideal for perfecting hand technique or rhythm, but not a great choice when you need to actually hear how the drum will sound.   Using mute pads also alters the rebound of the drum, causing your drumming to feel different. 

fill the bass drum with a pillow.  mute with plastic o-rings.  use mute pads.

acquire a frying pan.  get an egg.  walk to the pan on your kitchen counter.  choose the ingredients that you need for the recipe.  finished. 

 Start with the stove heat on high to get the oil nice and hot, quickly. The onions should sizzle when you put them in the pan with the oil.   Once you see oil evaporating a little bit, the oil is ready for the onions.; , It's easier to fry onions in smaller portions, so for 2 sliced onions, you can try frying 3 batches or so., Deep fry the onions on medium heat until they turn a golden brown. This should take about 10-20 minutes.   While they are sizzling in the oil, gently mix the onions around to keep all of them coated, and to disperse the heat and oil evenly. If the flame is very high the onions will burn on the outside and remain watery on the inside.  Use a big, perforated spoon (a spoon with holes in it for drainage) to removes the onions from the pan once they are golden brown. You want a perforated spoon to drain out excess oil.   Place the onions on a plate with a paper towel on it, to absorb the rest of the excess oil. Put the onions aside for later.  The bowl or pan needs to be big enough so there is enough room to mix the chicken in with the marinade, and have the marinade coat the chicken completely.   Keep the chicken in big pieces, and on the bone. Keeping the chicken on the bone will create a stock once the chicken is being cooked, adding a nice, full flavor to the biryani.  One by one add the marinade ingredients to the chicken:   Ginger garlic paste - 2 tbsp Red chili powder - 1 tbsp Salt - to taste (approximately 1 tsp) Yogurt - 1 cup Garam Masala Powder - 1 tsp Green cardamom powder - 1 tsp Cumin powder - 1 tsp Turmeric - 1/2 tsp Fried brown onions - 1 cup Ghee (clarified butter) - 4 tbsp Freshly chopped coriander leaves (cilantro) - 1/4 cup Mint leaves (no stalk) 10-15 2-4 green chilies (broken or cut) Lemon juice - 1 tbsp  , Mix all the ingredients until they are dispersed throughly, and the chicken pieces are completely covered with the marinade mixture. Once the chicken is coated with all the spices and flavorings, let it marinade.   There is a wide range of how long you can let the chicken marinade. You can marinade the chicken overnight to ensure the chicken absorbs all the flavors, or you can marinade it for less time. However, give the chicken a minimum of 4 hours to marinade to set in., Once you are finished with the marinading the chicken, cover and place the chicken in the refrigerator, and work on the other parts of the biryani.  Rinse the rice with cool water to remove some of the outermost starch, and then allow it to continue soaking in the water. Let the rice soak between 30 minutes to 1 hour.   For biryani, you want to use basmati rice to give the fullest flavor to the dish.  This is the water you are going to cook the rice in. The water must be boiling before you add the rice.  Along with the rice, add some other ingredients to give the rice a full flavor, and prevent the rice from sticking:5 green cardamoms 2 black cardamoms 3 cloves 2 pieces of cinnamon 1 bay leaf 1 piece of mace 1 tsp of ghee 1/2 tsp of salt  , Stir the ingredients to make sure they are all mixed in, and then cover the rice boil it for 8-10 minutes or until the rice is cooked half to three quarters of the way. Once the rice is cooked half to three quarters, you can take out the whole ingredients you added earlier (cloves, cardamoms, etc.)  , Since the rice should only be cooked half to a quarter of the way when you take it off the stove, the grains should be soft on the outside but still hard in the middle.   This is because the rest of the rice gets cooked on dum (when you layer the chicken and rice, seal it with dough around the edges to lock in the steam, and put it on a very low flame). You can tell how cooked the rice is by taking a grain and pressing it with your fingers. The rice should break apart into pieces, but still have a hard texture to it. If it is soft and mushes in your fingers, you have cooked it too much., Turn off the heat once you rice is cooked half to three quarters of the way, and let it sit. The hot water will cook the rice a little bit more, without cooking it too much., Add 1/4 tsp saffron to 2 tbsp of warm milk and let it soak for approximately 15 minutes. This saffron mixture will go on top of the rice when you are preparing to cook the final part of the biryani and it will give a nice flavoring.  Place 2 cups of chapati flour in a bowl and add approximately 3/4 cup of lukewarm water.Stir until the mixture forms a soft dough.   If the dough is dry and isn't really mixing well, you can add 1-2 tablespoons of water. Knead the dough by pushing on it with your knuckles and heels of your hands. Make sure your hands are damp with water while doing this so the dough doesn't stick to your skin. Knead the dough for about 10 minutes to ensure it is fully mixed together.  Traditionally, biryani is cooked in an Indian cooking pot called a biryani handi, but any thick bottom pot will work just fine.A non-stick pot/handi works best.   Spread the chicken so each piece of chicken is touching the bottom and/or sides of the pot. This will help ensure that each piece of chicken gets cooked throughly.  The rice that you cooked earlier is now ready to be added to the chicken. Create a layer of rice, adding about half of the rice on top of the chicken.   With your perforated spoon, pack the rice firmly into the pot. It is okay if some water comes along with the rice, it will help things cook with the steam. On top of the rice, sprinkle on fried onions(approximately 2 tbsp), chopped coriander leaves(approximately 1tbsp), and mint leaves (approximately 8-10).You can also sprinkle on cashew or golden raisins, but these are optional.  This is the second, and final layer of rice you will be adding to the biryani. Once the rest of the rest is spread evenly, add on the rest of the brown onions (approximately 1 tbsp), a little bit more coriander leaves (approximately 1/2 tbsp), mint leaves (3-5), the saffron milk mixture, and approximately 6 tbsp of ghee.An alternative and optional topping is adding some rose water. Just add about 1/2 a capful, and sprinkle it over the top of the biryani., Roll the chapati dough into long pieces and put the dough on the edges of the pot's upside down lid.You add the chapati dough to the edges of the lid, so when you turn the lid right side up, the dough seals the pot so the chicken and rice can steam cook together.   Press lightly but firmly to make sure the lid is secure and tight. You can add a weight to the lid to ensure that it stays sealed, but usually if you use the dough, it is sealed good enough.  Keep the biryani cooking for about 5-10 on high flame. Then, take the pot off the flame, put a cooking plate on the flame, and place the pot back on the flame with the cooking plate.   This is the safest method to cook the biryani and make sure the biryani doesn't burn because of the direct contact with the heat.After about 35 switch off the flame, but don't open the biryani yet. Let the biryani sit for another 10 minutes.  The dough will be a little cooked and hardened, but crack through it, and take of the top to check the biryani.   A lot of steam will come out so be careful not to burn yourself. Slowly stick a large spoon on the inside side of the hand and lift to get the bottom layers of the rice out. Then, as you work your way down, bring up a piece of chicken. The pieces of chicken should have a brown coloring.  Usually, biryani is eaten with your hands, and is served with raita, a cold, refreshing, yogurt condiment. 

heat the oil in the pan.  add your onions to the oil.  reduce the flame to medium.  take out the onions from the pan.  put the chicken in a bowl or pan.  add the spices and powders to the chicken.  mix your ingredients.  refrigerate the chicken.  soak the rice.  bring 8 cups of water to a boil.  add the rice.  stir the added ingredients.  check the consistency of the rice.  turn off the heat.  prepare the saffron milk.  prepare the sealing dough.  place chicken into a thick bottom pot.  spread the rice.  add the next layer of rice.  put the lid on the pot upside down.  cook the biryani.  carefully remove the pot's top.  enjoy!

 Slice the cabbage half into lengthwise halves, and cut each half into lengthwise halves again. You should be left with four wedges.   If the cabbage core has not yet been removed, cut the hard core out after slicing the cabbage half into two wedges.  Rinse the potatoes under cool, running water and cut them into wedges.   If using red potatoes, you should only scrub them gently with your fingers instead of using a vegetable brush, since these potatoes have thinner skins. Cut each potato into quarters, and cut each quarter into three crosswise pieces.  Fill a stockpot with 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) of water and bring it to a simmer over medium to medium-high heat.   You should have a steamer basket that fits inside the stockpot. The bottom of the basket should not come in contact with the water in the stockpot, though, even when the water is at a full rolling boil.  The potatoes should be placed on the bottom and the cabbage should be spread out in a single layer over the potatoes.   If you do not have a steamer basket, you could also use a metal colander. The potatoes are denser and usually take longer to cook, so they should be placed on the bottom, which will be the hottest part of the basket since it receives the most direct heat.  Cover the stockpot and cook until the potatoes and cabbage are both tender.  Spray a skillet with nonstick cooking spray and add the caraway seeds. Cook, stirring frequently, until the seeds take on a stronger fragrance and a deeper color.   This should take about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat as soon as you finish toasting them.  After the caraway seeds have cooled for a couple of minutes, transfer them to a small mixing bowl. Add the onion, garlic, salt, and yogurt to the bowl, as well, and stir until evenly distributed.  Transfer the cabbage and potatoes to individual serving dishes and add a dab of the flavored yogurt sauce over each serving.   Alternatively, you could set the bowl of yogurt sauce out in the middle of the table and allow your family or guests to add the yogurt sauce as they desire.  

cut the cabbage into wedges.  clean and cut the potatoes.  set a stockpot of water to a simmer.  place the cabbage and potatoes in a steamer basket.  steam for 25 minutes.  meanwhile, toast the caraway seeds in a small skillet.  combine the seeds, onion, garlic, salt, and yogurt.  serve the steamed vegetables with the yogurt sauce. 

 The first step in any emergency situation is to stop and assess the situation. See if you can determine what caused the injury to the person and if it is safe for you to approach. t doesn't help anyone to rush into a situation before the hazard has completely ended — you can't help the person if you fall victim to the same emergency, and emergency medical services (EMS) does not need to rescue two people instead of one.; , These include: Slurred speech A rapid heartbeat Confusion Dizziness Lightheadedness Suddenly being unable to respond coherently, or unable to respond at all  , A series of questions will immediately give you a lot of information regarding the person’s state. The questions should be easy while still requiring a level of basic cognition. Begin by asking the person if he’s all right to see if he’s responsive at all. If the person responds or even groans to show that he’s not unconscious, try asking:Can you tell me what year it is? Can you tell me what month it is? What day is it? Who is the president? Do you know where you are? Do you know what happened? If the person answers clearly and coherently, then he is displaying a high level of consciousness. If the person responds but answers incorrectly to several of the first questions, then he’s conscious but showing signs of what is called an altered or changed mental state, which includes confusion and disorientation., If the person is conscious but showing signs of an altered mental state (such as being unable to clearly answer simple questions), then you should call 911 immediately. When you call 911, inform them of the patient's score on an AVPU scale:   A — Alert and oriented  V — Responds to Verbal stimuli  P — Responds to Painful stimuli  U — Unconscious/no response   Even if the person responds coherently to all of your questions and shows no signs of an altered mental state, you should still call 911 if the person:Has other injuries from the traumatic event Feels chest pain or discomfort Has a pounding or irregular heartbeat Reports impairment to vision Cannot move her arms or legs    , This is useful to see if you can gather any clues as to what caused the person to either pass out or have a diminishing level of consciousness. The person may or may not be able to answer any of these, depending upon his level of consciousness and how responsive he is. Try asking: Can you tell me what happened? Are you on any medications? Do you have diabetes? Have you ever experienced a diabetic coma? Are you on any drugs or have you been drinking? (You may want to look around for any signs of needle marks on arms/feet or bottles of medication of alcohol nearby.) Do you have a seizure disorder? Do you have have a heart condition or have you ever had a heart attack? Did you have chest pain or any other symptoms prior to going down?  , The person’s answers—whether logical or nonsense—will help the emergency responders determine the best course of action. Write everything down if you need to in order to pass along the information just as the person communicated it.   For instance, if the person has given incoherent answers to most of your questions but also communicated that she has a seizure disorder, then she may continue answering questions incorrectly for five to ten minutes in the post-seizure phase of the disorder, yet she may require little more than a brief period of observation from paramedics. As another example, if the person has confirmed that she is diabetic, then the emergency responder will know to immediately check her glucose levels when you pass along that information.  If the person has provided incoherent answers to all of your questions—or if he’s given logical answers but seems on the verge of nodding off—then do what you can to keep the person talking to you. Emergency responders will have a much easier time assessing the situation if the person is conscious when they arrive. Ask the person if he can keep his eyes open for you, and ask him additional questions that encourage him to keep talking.  If you know the person or witnessed her "pass out," you may be able to provide emergency medical staff with clues as to the diagnosis or "cause" of unconsciousness. Common causes of diminished consciousness or loss of consciousness include: Severe blood loss Severe injury to the head or chest Drug overdose Alcohol intoxication A car accident or other major injury Blood sugar problems (as in diabetics) Heart problems Low blood pressure (common in the elderly, but they usually regain consciousness shortly thereafter) Dehydration Seizure Stroke Hyperventilating  , In the event of many medical conditions—such as diabetes—the person may wear something like this to inform the condition to responders.If you find one, report it immediately to emergency medical personnel when they arrive.  It is important to have someone watching over the patient at all times. If he remains semi-conscious and appears to be breathing and not in any distress, continue to watch him until medical staff arrive. If the person becomes totally unresponsive, the situation is much more serious and you will need to assess him further and proceed with the steps below.  Try yelling, "Are you okay?" and shake the person gently. This may be all it takes to bring the person back to consciousness.  If the person is unresponsive to your questions, but you are not sure whether she is "unconscious" to the degree that requires CPR, then you should administer a painful stimulus to see if it produces a conscious reaction.The most common form of this is a "sternal rub," which entails making a fist and using your knuckles to rub vigorously into the person's sternum or breastbone. If the person responds to "pain" — to this sensation — you can continue to monitor her without CPR as this is a sign that she is okay for the moment. (If she does not respond to pain, however, you will likely need to proceed to CPR.) If you fear the person otherwise has a chest injury from the trauma, other methods of testing her pain response include pinching the person’s fingernail or nail bed or pinching the person’s trapezius muscle (back of the neck). The pinch should be very hard and directly to the muscle.If the person responds to the pain by either curling all her limbs in or out, this is referred to as posturing and could be indicative of spinal injury.  You likely have already done this, but especially if the person is unresponsive to pain, you need to make sure that an ambulance is on the way. Remain on the line with the operator, or if someone else is there, hand the phone to him so he can receive further instruction.  If the person is unconscious but breathing, then you may not have to perform CPR, especially if no one around is certified in the practice. Be sure to keep a constant watch on the rise and fall of the person’s chest to ensure that he’s still breathing. If you cannot tell by watching alone, you can place your ear near his mouth or nose and listen for breath sounds. When you listen at someone's mouth, point your head down his body to the chest and watch his chest rise and fall at the same time. This is the easiest way to see breathing. Note that if you have any reason to suspect a spinal injury but the person is breathing, then do not try to reposition him unless he vomits. In this case, roll his entire body to the side while supporting his neck and back to keep them in the same position.If you have no reason to suspect a spinal injury, then roll the person onto his side, position his top leg so that both his hip and knee are at a 90° angle (to stabilize him on his side), and then softly tilt his head back to help keep his airway open.This is called the "recovery position" and is the safest for the patient to be in, in case he vomits at any point.  You can check the person's pulse on the underside of her wrist on the thumb side — called the "radial pulse," or by gently feeling one side of her neck about an inch below her ear — called the "carotid pulse." Always check the carotid pulse on the same side of the body on which you are sitting. Reaching across the neck of a patient for her pulse can cause panic if she wakes up.   If a pulse is absent at any point, and especially if there is no breathing, now is the time to start CPR if you are trained; if not, follow instructions of emergency medical personnel over the telephone. If you accidentally hung up after initially calling them, you can call back at this point for further instructions. They are trained to provide instructions for laypeople over the phone.  Cardiac arrest is one of the most common reasons for a person to collapse and become unresponsive for no other obvious reason, such as due to a car accident. Providing CPR (if necessary) while waiting for the arrival of paramedics can double or even triple a person’s chance of survival in the event of cardiac arrest.Find out if anyone in the immediate vicinity is CPR certified.  If the person isn’t breathing or has stopped breathing, then the first step is to check his airway. Place one hand on his forehead and the other underneath his jaw. With the forehead hand, slide his head backward and tilt his jaw with the other. Watch for any signs of his chest beginning to rise and fall. Place your ear over his mouth and feel for any breath on your face.   If you can easily see something in his airway when you look into his mouth, then try to remove it, but only if the object is loose. If the object is clearly lodged, then do not try to remove it from his throat since you may inadvertently push the object farther down his airway.The reason we check the airway first is that if there is a blockage (or an obstruction, such as often happens in choking victims), and if we can easily remove it, our problem is solved. However, if there is not, check for a pulse and, if there is no pulse (or if you cannot find one and are in doubt), immediately begin chest compressions. Head-tilt chin-lifts should not be done on skull, spine, neck injuries. Instead, use the jaw-thrust method, in which you kneel above the person's head and place your hands on either side of his head. Place your middle and index finger along his jaw bone and gently push it upward so that the jaw is jutting forward, as though he has an underbite.  Current CPR standards place the emphasis on chest compressions with a ratio of thirty compressions for every two rescue breaths.Begin chest compressions by:Placing the heel of your hand on the person’s breastbone directly between his nipples Placing the heel of your opposite hand over the top of the first Positioning your body mass directly over your positioned hands Compressing hard and fast downward approximately two inches into his chest Allowing his chest to rise completely Repeating to a count of thirty At this point, add in the two rescue breaths if you are trained in CPR. If you are not, continue with compressions and ignore the breaths as they are much less important.  You can stop performing CPR as soon as the person shows signs of breathing on his own.Watch for the rise and fall of the person’s chest and place your ear near his mouth to check if he’s breathing on his own.  If the person continues to show no signs of consciousness or breathing on his own, then keep performing CPR at a rate of two rescue breaths to every thirty chest compressions until emergency responders arrive. 

size up the scene.  recognize signs of when a person may be losing consciousness.  ask the person questions.  call 911.  ask follow-up questions.  keep track of all the person’s answers.  keep the person talking to you.  be aware of other common causes of unconsciousness.  check the person for a medical alert necklace or bracelet.  monitor the person until emergency medical personnel arrive.  attempt to wake the person with a loud noise.  administer painful stimuli.  ensure that you have called 911.  check if the person is breathing.  check for a pulse.  ask if anyone around knows cpr.  check the person’s airway.  perform chest compressions.  check for signs of breathing again (reassess the person for breathing approximately every two minutes).  continue cpr until paramedics arrive.

 As hard as it is to consider, it’s possible that your parents are actually treating your fairly and with the right amount of caution.   Do you have a trusted aunt, uncle or grandparent with whom you could discuss your situation? Do you think your high school guidance counselor could offer you some advice? If you don’t feel like you could talk to other adults because you’re afraid they’d end up siding with your parents and agreeing that you currently have the correct limits placed on you, that might indicate that your parents actually are being fair. If that’s the case, you need to be honest with yourself.  You’ll feel better after writing down your thoughts without fear of offending anyone, and you’ll be able to reread your journal over time to see how well you are following your parents’ rules and behaving in a mature manner.   Your journal will provide a written history of how you and your parents are negotiating your rules. If you are truly following their guidelines and behaving as they want you to, you will be able to show them that you've kept your word. This will allow you to produce evidence for your argument and help you prove that they can trust you with more freedom.  Consider why the rules are in place and what your parents believe those rules are accomplishing.If you had a teenaged daughter, would you allow her to go to a party at a friend’s house with no adults around? Would you allow your 14-year-old daughter to go on dates with no adult supervision? Your parents were once the age you are now, and it’s very possible that they got away with behavior that they don’t want you to repeat. If you can’t see any reason for the rules, ask your parents to explain them. For instance, you could say, "I know you want to keep me safe, but I was wondering why you think allowing me to go to a movie on a Friday night would be putting me in a dangerous situation." They might have reasons that they’ve never mentioned to you or that you haven’t considered, and you might be able to ease some of their fears. For example, if you want to attend a movie with a group of friends but your parents are afraid someone might pose a threat to you, you could say "I understand your fears, but I would be with a group of girls my age, and we'd be in public the whole time. If anyone was threatening us, we'd call for help and leave that situation." Remember that your parents have a reason for their rules. Even if their rules seem unreasonable, your parents put them in place because they want to protect you, and the reason they want to protect you is because they love you. Someday you might thank them for it.  You’ll be out on your own someday, and you’ll be free to make your own rules. Even if your parents’ are placing ridiculous limitations on your behavior, you will be an adult soon. If you have no choice but to suffer through this period of your life, you can use this time as an opportunity to learn discipline and patience.  

talk to a family friend or trusted adult.emotions run high when you’re a teenager, and you might not perceive your situation correctly.  keep a journal and write about your feelings toward your parents’ rules.  think about the rules from your parents’ perspective.  don’t forget that this situation is only temporary. 

 Sterile saline, such as that found in first aid kits, is the ideal substance for flushing a contaminated wound.The physical act of washing removes the bacteria and debris, while the saline is so similar to the pH of the body tissues that it causes minimal tissue damage.   The trick to using saline is to use large volumes and keep washing until the area looks clean.; , For a very dirty wound with lots of mud or gravel in it, an alternative is to boil water and then let it cool. Use this water to literally wash the area clean.   There is a slight risk using water that it will damage the exposed tissue bed, as it does not have the same composition as body fluids and therefore draws fluid out of damaged tissue. However, medical studies have shown that using tap water to irrigate a wound does not have a huge impact on whether the wound eventually gets infected., Salt water has natural disinfectant properties and is a good standby for cleaning a cat's wound. To make a salt water solution boil the kettle, measure out a cup of water,and add half a teaspoon of salt. Then stir to dissolve and leave to cool.   This salt water is also around the same composition as tears and body fluids, so it is less damaging to exposed tissue than commercial disinfectant solutions or water alone.  There are a variety of disinfectants that are sold for use on pet wounds. The most common are providone-Iodine and chlorhexidine. Consult with your veterinarian if you want to have one of these products on hand if your cat gets scratched up.   Remember, not all disinfectants are safe for cats. Those contained phenol are toxic to felines. Read the label to see if the product is a phenolic disinfectant, and avoid using if it is. Another sign the product contains phenol is if it goes cloudy when water is added. If in doubt, avoid and use an alternative. To use povidone-Iodine dilute it by mixing 1 ml of povidone-iodine with 100 ml of water.Use this solution to wash away contamination from the surface of the wound. To use chlorhexidine mix 2.5ml of chlorhexidine with 100 ml of water to make the correct strength to clean a wound.Chlorhexidine is the active constituent in many surgical scrubs, such as Hibiscrub. It is a pink soapy solution that needs to be diluted in water. Chlorhexidine has good antibacterial properties and also has a slight residual action, which means it keeps on working at killing bacteria for a while after it has dried.  Another popular wound cleansing agent is hydrogen peroxide. However, this has the potential to be very damaging to tissue if used undiluted. The 'myth' is that the fizzing as the peroxide contacts the wounds is simply killing the bacteria, but unfortunately it is also damaging the tissue bed, which needs to be healthy for future healing.   The correct dilution is to take a 3% solution of hydrogen peroxide and mix one part peroxide with three parts water (for example 25 ml of peroxide with 75ml of water) to make a disinfectant solution that is suitable for cleaning wounds., The disinfectant to use is a matter of personal preference and what you have available. Always follow the instructions on how to dilute the product, because using it too concentrated can be damaging to tissue. Be aware that many household disinfectants and some disinfectant sprays contain benzalkonium chloride and are not designed for use on living tissue.If in doubt as to the suitability of a product for use on a cat, then consider just using a saline or salt water solution instead, as this is always safe.  Your cat may be in pain or shaken up after an injury and it may lash out when you touch the sore area. This is true even if it is normally sweet tempered. With this in mind, try to enlist the help of a friend or neighbor to hold the cat so that you can concentrate on the wound.   Try wrapping the cat in a large bath towel with just the wound exposed. This is a good way to keep it calm and minimize the risk from teeth and claws., Grab your chosen rinsing solution and place it in a bowl. Use a syringe to suck up the solution, and then squirt it over the wound to rinse and clean it. Repeatedly spray the wound this way until you are happy the wound is clean.   Fresh bite wounds need to be cleaned and disinfected, to reduce the risk of infection.Scrape wounds sustained if the cat was hit by a car or fell from a tree, may be contaminated with grit, gravel, and bacteria. A thorough cleaning to remove contamination helps reduce the risk of complications, such as poor healing or infection.  If you do not have a syringe, then soak clean cotton wool in the cleaning solution and squeeze the cotton wool so the solution runs down over the wound. If the area is very contaminated, and this is not lifting the debris away, then use downward stroking movements with the cotton wool to clean the area.   Use a clean piece of soaked cotton wool for each downward wipe, so that the dirty piece does not recontaminate the wound on the next downward pass. Keep cleaning until the cotton wool comes away clean, and then finish with a rinse. If your cat has a burst abscess, a considerable volume of pus may leak from the wound. Use dry cotton wool, gauze, or absorbent paper tissue to wipe away the pus. Apply gentle pressure to the area around the abscess, pressing inward towards the tooth mark through which the pus is draining. It is important to remove as much pus as possible or it will act as an ongoing source of infection.  Once you have cleaned away the gross contamination, you can start applying the disinfectant. Follow the directions on the packaging for proper application.   The aim is to wipe away infection until you expose healthy, uncontaminated tissue and then apply the disinfectant.  Most wounds are best left open to the air, so do not attempt to bandage or cover a small, insignificant wound. However, if the cat is trying to lick or chew the wound then it needs to be covered. In these cases, the healing of the wound may be compromised.There is a myth that it's healthy for a cat to lick a wound. In truth, that abrasive tongue is likely to damage exposed tissues rather than promote healing.  As a cat owner, it's important to know your cat's normal behavior. This will help you to assess whether something is wrong. Look for changes in behavior, including, but not limited to, changes in eating patterns, types of movement, and interest in socializing.These can be the signs of a variety of illnesses, including physical trauma. If your cat's personality or behavior has changed drastically, and you can't figure out why, take it to a veterinarian. These changes could be symptoms of a medical problem.  If you heard a cat fight, or your cat comes back limping, then check the cat over for signs of trauma. A tell-tale sign of a fight are tufts of hair that are clumped together. Look at the cat and check to see if any areas of the coat look unkempt or are sticking up at an odd angle.Gently investigate the cat's body by parting the fur and looking at the skin underneath.   Alternatively you may find an area of hair loss, where the aggressor cat pulled the fur out. The area may have a wound, or you might see spots of blood or see a swollen area.This is easiest to spot on white or pale coated cats. For a black cat, gently run your hands over it and watch for a reaction to tenderness, or feel for a wound, swelling, or scabs.  You may not always witness a fight or see the signs of a fight on your cat's coat. This is why it is important to regularly inspect your cat for injuries that you might otherwise miss. This is especially important to do if your cat is an outdoor cat, and if it's prone to fighting.   A good time to do this is when you are snuggling and petting the cat. Keep the cat calm and gently sweep your hand over the body while looking at the skin beneath the fur. Older wounds may be infected, in which case you may find swelling, a scab, hair loss, or a bloody or purulent discharge. Old abscesses that have burst often contain a lot of pus which mats the fur. Also, the skin over the abscess dies off and can leave a considerable hole behind, through which you can see muscle or exposed tissues.  

find some sterile saline.  boil some water and use it once cooled.  make a salt water solution.  get a pet-safe commercial disinfectant.  dilute some hydrogen peroxide.  use the safest option that you have available.  get another person to help you hold the cat.  rinse the wound with a syringe.  use a cotton ball soaked with cleaning solution if you don't have a syringe.  apply disinfectant.  decide whether to bandage the wound.  watch your cat for signs of injury.  look for a wound if you witnessed, or heard, a fight.  regularly inspect your cat for injuries. 

 If you soil is low in magnesium, the grass that grows in it will be low in mineral as well. Considering that your horse receives the majority of its daily magnesium needs through a normal forage diet, it is important to understand if your soil is helping or hindering those needs.You can hire a soil testing service or test it yourself using a commercial test kit. The easiest way to avoid magnesium deficiency in your horse is to properly maintain your pastures.  Depending on the soil that they grow in, grasses can be magnesium deficient. The same is true of horse feed. In turn, this can cause your horse to develop a magnesium deficiency. Make sure that the grass and feed that your horse is eating are high in magnesium and other important minerals.Your retailer or distributor should provide information on the mineral make up of their feed.  Because magnesium is water-soluble, it is easily leached from the ground during rainy seasons. If it has recently rained a lot, the grass will likely not have enough magnesium in it, leading to your horse developing a deficiency. You can increase the magnesium in the soil by sprinkling dolomite or Epsom salts in the field or pasture where your horse feeds., Many consider skittishness a symptom of magnesium deficiency in horses. In fact, magnesium is often recommended as a supplement to help horses relax. If your horse seems more timid than usual, they may be suffering from a magnesium deficiency.There is little scientific evidence to support this claim. If your horse is acting anxious, consult your veterinarian before giving it any supplements.  

research your soil’s mineral makeup.  evaluate magnesium levels in new grass or feed.  consider what time of year it is.  observe if your horse seems nervous or skittish.

 When describing a ring, it helps to know how professional jewelers refer to each part.The band refers to the portion of the ring that actually wraps around your finger. The shank can refer to the band as a whole, but it more commonly refers to the portions of the ring that sit on either side of a gemstone. The gallery is the underside of the band and is the portion that actually sits on top of the finger.; , Ring bands can be made from a variety of base metals, but gold, platinum, silver, tungsten carbide, titanium, and palladium are the most common options.Gold bands are classic and available in multiple colors. Yellow gold is the purest and most traditional. White gold is created when yellow gold is plated with rhodium, and rose gold is created when a copper alloy is mixed into the metal. Purity is indicated by karat size. Larger karats indicate greater purity. Platinum is almost always 95 percent pure. It is a white metal that is very durable, heavy, and naturally hypoallergenic. Silver is a white-gray metal that is very soft and weak against damage, so it tends to be an inexpensive choice. It is more commonly used in fashion rings than in engagement or wedding rings. Tungsten carbide is gray metal made from tungsten and carbon. It is very hard, heavy, and durable. Even though it retains is luster, it cannot be cut and re-soldered due to its durability, so bands made with it cannot be re-sized. Titanium has a naturally gray finish but is sometimes polished black. It is as strong as steel but as light as aluminum and is a popular choice for men's rings. The metal is also hypoallergenic. Palladium is silver-white in color. It does not tarnish and is both hypoallergenic and flexible. Rings may also use recycled materials. Recycled metal can come from a variety of sources and will take on the traits of its dominant metal., A ring may include special designs or other features that are not common enough to categorize. Even though there is no way to categorize these characteristics, you should still describe them when describing the ring.   Metalwork designs are a common example of such characteristics. For example, the band might be designed to mimic the shape of leaves, or there might be a carefully crafted wire flower centered in place over an otherwise simple band. Another special feature worth mentioning might be an engraving. Most engravings are personal in nature. They can either be placed on the gallery of the ring or on the top surface of the band.  Some rings consist of nothing more than a solid metal band. Others include one or more gemstones. The latter must be described in further detail since you'll need to elaborate on the gemstone type, quality, and placement.  The setting style of a ring refers to the placement of gemstones along the ring. There are many different settings to choose from.The channel setting has two metal tracks with a row of tiny gemstones in between. The bezel setting places a single gemstone within a thin, flat piece of protective metal. With a pave setting, one large stone sits at the center of the band while the rest of the band is covered by many small stones. In a prong setting, thin metal "claws" extend up from the band to hold a center gemstone in place. There will usually be four to six of these metal prongs. There can also be shared prong settings in which small adjacent stones share prongs with the large center stone. A cluster setting places one large gemstone at the center of the band and surrounds this gemstone with smaller outward facing gems on all sides. In a gypsy setting, the stone or stones are sunk into holes along the band of the ring. As a result, the stones are flush with the band's surface. For that reason, this can also be referred to as a “flush” setting. A tension setting is similar to a gypsy or flush setting, but the holes are more shallow and the gemstones rise about the surface of the band. Tension alone holds each stone in place. With a bar setting, small gemstones encircle the entire ring and small metal bars separate each one from the next. With an invisible setting, special grooves are cut into the band that allow the gemstones to sit securely in place without metal bars or prongs holding them up.  Identify the center gemstone. If the ring has more than one gemstone, you will need to name each one.   Diamonds are a popular gemstone, especially for engagement rings. They also happen to be the birthstone for the month of April. Cubic zirconia looks similar but is less radiant and much less expensive. Other popular birthstones include: garnet (January), amethyst (February), aquamarine (March), emerald (May), alexandrite (June), pearls (also June), ruby (July), peridot (August), sapphire (September), opal (October), tourmaline (also October), topaz (November), tanzanite (December), turquoise (also December), and zircon (also December). Additional gemstones you might find are citrine (ranging in color from yellow to orange-brown), jade (bright green), lapis lazuli (dark blue), moonstone (typically colorless), morganite (soft pinks and peaches), onyx (black), paraiba tourmaline (electric blues and greens), and spinel (bright red)., In simple terms, the cut of a stone refers to the shape of the stone. Accent stones tend to be square or round, but the center stone can come in a wide variety of cuts.The round cut or brilliant cut is the most popular shape. It features a round crown and girdle with a smaller conical base. The oval cut has a symmetrical oval crown. The princess cut is a square cut. The banquette cut looks like a narrow triangle. The triangle cut has a triangular crown. Marquise cut stones are almond-shaped or football-shaped. Pear cuts are also known as teardrop cuts. The top of the crown is pointed and the bottom is rounded. Heart shaped stones are, as the name suggests, shaped like hearts. The emerald cut looks like a tall rectangle with cut corners. The radiant cut is a blend between the emerald and brilliant cuts. The outer shape looks like an emerald cut but faces are strategically placed to refract light like a brilliant cut would. Trillion or trilliant cuts look like triangles with curved sides.  The carat is the standard unit of measurement used to weigh gemstones. A larger carat size indicates a larger stone.   One carat equals 200 milligrams.Gemstones can also be measured in size, but when describing the stone, you would usually only mention the carat weight.  Naming the type of gemstone does not adequately describe the color of the stone. Color is broken down further into three separate characteristics: hue, tone, and saturation.   The hue refers to the primary color of the stone. Some stones only come in one hue, but others are available in multiple hues. For instance, jade is always green, but moonstone can be colorless, gray, brown, yellow, green, or pink. Tone simply refers to how light or dark the color of the stone appears. Saturation is the intensity of color. Stones with bright, vivid colors are more saturated than stones with a light tint of color.  Gemstone clarity essentially refers to the amount of inclusions contained within the stone. Stones with fewer inclusions have greater clarity.   Inclusions are cracks and cuts that are visible from inside the stone. Some accidental inclusions decrease the value of a stone while carefully crafted inclusions can increase its value. Certain gemstone types are more likely to have inclusions than others.  Oftentimes, rings are purchased with a specific meaning or purpose in mind. You would usually label such a ring by it intended purpose without giving the matter a second thought.   Engagement rings and wedding rings are the most obvious examples. Birthstone rings might be given as a special gift for someone's birthday. Class rings are usually worn to acknowledge and celebrate one's high school or college graduation class.  When describing your ring, you may also indicate the size of the ring. Sizes are based on the diameter of the ring band.   Adult ring sizes usually range from size 4.5 to size 13.Size 4.5 rings are 0.58 inches (14.8 mm). Size 5 rings are 0.61 inches (15.6 mm). Size 6 rings are 0.65 inches (16.45 mm). Size 7 rings are 0.68 inches (17.3 mm). Size 8 rings are 0.72 inches (18.2 mm). Size 9 rings are 0.75 inches (19 mm). Size 10 rings are 0.78 inches (19.9 mm). Size 11 rings are 0.81 inches (20.6 mm). Size 12 rings are 0.84 inches (21.4 mm). Size 13 rings are 0.87 inches (22.2 mm).  Most rings stand alone, but some rings are sold in sets. Each ring in the set may look slightly different, but the overall design of all rings in the set will share some similarities.   Engagement rings are sometimes sold in sets with wedding bands. Simple fashion rings may also be purchased in sets, but this is slightly less common.  Including the cost of the ring in your description is not often necessary, but there are times when the circumstances may warrant it.   Always state the price in clear terms if you are describing a ring you want to sell. Mention the price if you are debating whether or not to purchase a ring and are describing it to someone who may help you reach that decision. Typically, you would not mention the price of a ring you already own when you are only describing it to friends or acquaintances.  

know how to refer to the various parts.  identify the metal.  note any distinctive characteristics.  state whether or not it includes gemstones.  describe the setting style.  name the gemstones.  specify the cut of the center gemstone.  note the carat weight.  indicate the gemstone color.  describe the clarity of the gemstone.  note the purpose.  indicate the size.  state whether or not it comes as a set.  consider stating the price.

 One of the major causes of falling too hard for a guy is seeing him as flawless. Remind yourself that no one is flawless. Instead of choosing to ignore his shortcomings, figure them out and think about whether or not you can accept them. If you avoid this and end up in a relationship with him, his inability to maintain the perfect image you created for him will damage the relationship.Try having a conversation about weaknesses. He probably knows his flaws best, and learning this information from him might help to ground you. Tell him your weaknesses too so that he doesn’t assume that you’re perfect either.  When you’re in the giddy early phase of getting to know a romantic interest, you can be blind to the reality of relationships. Look back briefly on past experiences that didn’t quite work out in your favor. Consider the fact that some of those hard times could happen with this new guy that you like. Ask yourself if you're willing to go through that pain again. Ask yourself if you see the potential for any of those problems to come up again., When you’re really starting to develop feelings, sometimes it’s hard to stay true to who you are. You might be acting a certain way that appeals to him in order to speed up the relationship’s development. While this might get his interest in the short term, it’ll eliminate the possibility of a healthy relationship later. Be honest about the fact that you love rap music even if you know he only listens to country. It might take longer for him to know if the two of you are compatible enough, but this slower progression is more healthy and natural, and if things finally do progress, you’ll know it’s for the right reasons. 

avoid putting him on a pedestal.  remind yourself of past failed relationships.  be yourself if you want it to last. 

 This app is free and will enable you to connect to your Fitbit.

 t’s okay to admit when you don’t know the answer or even that something had you a little scared. Children, especially older ones, can sense insincerity. Being honest with children lets them know that you are authentic and that they can trust you, which is one of the biggest part of forming a bond.It also sets an example for how you would like them to be with you.   For example, tell them that you’re honestly a little nervous about getting to know them. If a child asks you about something difficult, traumatic, or scary that they see or hear about, then be honest and age-appropriate about the situation.; , Although you should be honest with young children as much as possible, sometimes children will ask you things that are a little too personal, or about a topic that is too mature for their age. Sometimes they do this out of genuine curiosity, sometimes just as a “test” to see how much you will tell them.   If a child asks you something that you aren’t comfortable answering, then try saying, “that’s a conversation for another day” or, “Wow! That’s a really big question. I need some time to think about that”. You can also say, “I'm honestly not comfortable talking about that right now.”  , Doing so sets a good example for children and strengthens your bond with them in several ways. It lets them know that you are human and relatable. It also demonstrates to them that it is okay to mess up, as well as how to handle it.   Don’t let a fear of making a mistake with or around the child stop you from bonding with them. If you make mistake, it just shows them that you are human. For example, you might try saying, “I made a mistake. I thought I was supposed to do it this way, but I wasn’t”.  Children are known for saying things that can be insensitive, rude, and just plain mean. Taking it personally can cause you to develop resentment toward the child which would definitely prevent you from bonding. Let the child know that it is not okay, but don’t let it hurt your feelings or make you angry.   Often, especially with younger children, they don’t realize that what they are saying is hurting. Gently let them know that what they said was not okay. If needed give them another way to say it. Older children may do it intentionally as part of acting out, or even just because they are experiencing natural hormone changes that are making them moody.  

be honest.  don’t divulge everything.  admit your mistakes.  don’t take it personally. 

 It is suggested that margin sizes be 1-1.5 inches (3-3.5 cm).; , Do not make indentations unless you are using bullets to clarify a point.   Avoid "justifying" or "align righting" your letter. These alignments make letters difficult to read. Your right margins should be ragged, not uniform.  This allows for the correct amount of white space and ease of reading.   Most readers find starting letters or paragraphs near the end of a page challenging. It tends to interrupt a reader's concentration.  Having these gaps tell the reader you are moving on to the next point or topic of the letter.   This break between blocks of text is also a way to give the person's eyes a break while he or she is reading.  This can also give the reader an illusion of more white space.  

set uniform margins on the left and right sides of the document.  keep all your paragraphs lined up on the left side throughout your letter.  start the body of your letter no lower than midway down your page.  leave 2 lines of space between paragraphs.  organize your letter so it does not appear repetitive by mixing up your use of paragraph lengths. 

 If your dislike of this person comes from them antagonizing or displaying potential harmful behavior toward you, do not be afraid to stand up for yourself. Let an authority figure know, whether that be your teacher, your boss, or the police, if necessary.Explain the situation to them and let them know what this person has done to make you feel threatened or harmed.

 There is a big difference between online classes that are run through a program specifically for a high school and one for colleges. There is more work involved in a college based program, and you are expected to manage your time like an adult. For that effort, you will get 6 quality points in your grade point average instead of 4 though in most cases.; , In many schools it is considered a privilege, not a right to take online classes, as schools have to pay by the student for the classes so they want to be sure they are only paying for those who have the highest chance for success. Speaking of paying for the class, if you go to a private school, you may have additional class fees for online classes, so be sure to ask about that, too.  Some online programs, for example don't offer core classes online, but they offer some electives.  Most colleges have moved into the 21st century, but the last thing you want is to find out that the only thing that will keep you from your dream school is some antiquated policy.  This doesn't vary from any other type of class. There may be more spaces available, but there will still be a limit.  There will likely be an enrollment verification that you need to complete and a deadline by which it needs to be done. High school classes may be somewhat flexible, but college classes will likely drop you from the class if you miss the deadline.   The first assignment will likely be something simple like introducing yourself on a discussion board or taking a quiz to show that you understand the rules and policies of the course.  This is the only way your teacher has to communicate with the class. Your teachers in your classrooms stand up in front of the class every day. Your online teacher uses the announcement forums. You must read them.   You also have to read the assignment postings and the syllabus. In a traditional class you might be able to get away with filing your syllabus in the round metal cabinet at the end of the teachers desk on your way out of the room, but you can't do that with an online class. Your teacher isn't there in front of you every day to remind you when your work is due. You have to read the announcements, the assignment postings, and the syllabus.  In college classes if you miss a due date, you will likely get a 0. A lenient teacher might give you 10 points off for every day it's late. People tend to make the mistake of thinking an online class is a work at your own pace class. It isn't. It is a flexible schedule class to some degree, but there are assignments and there are due dates and more so than any other type of class, you have to manage your time effectively.  If it can go wrong it will. Technology fails. Power goes out. Computers crash. The proverbial dog will eat your proverbial homework and your proverbial teach won't give a proverbial -- you get the point. If you wait until the last minute, you will end up missing something. It's never a good idea, and with an online class, it is a terrible idea. Just don't do it.  

first find out if your school offers the option to take online classes, or if they will allow you to enroll in an online class concurrently through the local community college.  find out if you meet your school's criteria for taking online classes.  find out if the classes you need for your graduation requirements are available online.  make sure that the college you are planning to attend accepts credits from online classes or check with your high school to see if they notate anything on your transcript that indicates the difference between online and on ground classes.  once you have determined that online classes are the way to go, find out what the enrollment dates are and get enrolled before the deadline.  on the first day of class, log in and read the announcements.  throughout the course, make sure you read the announcements regularly.  don't miss due dates.  don't wait until the last minute. 

 The GPS market is flooded with different devices, options, and features. Unless you plan on using your GPS in the wilderness or for research experiments, however, your smart phone or a car GPS, can provide directions and your location quickly and easily. Most have touch screens and come with a rechargeable battery.    Smart Phones: Most smart phones come pre-loaded with a "Maps," or "Directions" app that uses GPS. If you do not have one, search and download an app, like Google Maps, from your app store to use GPS.GPS Devices: These are small, rectangular devices that specialize in driving directions and finding restaurants, airports, and other points of interest. Examples include TomTom and Garmin, and most cost under $170 dollars.; , This is the basic screen for a GPS. It shows a location, usually with your current location at the center, and all of the roads and major landmarks nearby.  Some GPS use touch screens, others have keypads, and some have scroll wheels and buttons. Click on the button labeled with a compass, navigational arrow, or crosshairs to show your current location.   Your location is sometimes stored under the heading "Where am I?" "Favorite Locations," or "Current." iPhone users can see their current location using the built-in Compass App. Make sure you "Allow Location Services" for the compass under "Settings" → "Privacy" → "Location Services" → "Compass"  , Using the search bar found at the top of your GPS, type in the address you want to reach. Many touch screen GPS's let you choose a location by holding your finger on the location in the map.   Some GPS's will prompt you with a button labeled "Get Directions." Choose this if there is no search bar to input an address. If you know the exact latitude and longitude of your trip, use these; they will give you the most accurate location possible.  The GPS will give you directions at every turn you need to take. Don't worry if you miss a turn -- most GPS will auto-correct and give you a new route to get back on track.   If you are struggling to keep up, check your GPS's settings and make the "Turn Warning Frequency" setting longer -- giving you more time to hear the next direction.  

buy a smartphone or car gps to get directions and your location.  open the "map.",  click on "my location.",  choose your destination address.  follow the gps instructions to get to your location. 

 As often as you can, see how you can be of service to your teen as they attempt to change their smelly ways. See if they need more time in the restroom in the mornings to get ready. If so, then perhaps help them to wake up a bit earlier. Or, if they need more money to buy items, see if they can give you a list and you’ll get them.You might say, “I’m running to the store for a few things. Would you like to give me a list of any bathroom or personal items that you need?” You can also help your teen problem-solve. For example, if they are low on time in the mornings, then you might suggest that they shower the night before or lay out their clothes to help make getting ready in the morning a little faster.  Depending on your teen they may be excited or dreading going shopping. So, tailor the trip according to their personality and needs. You could even split this up into a few brief shopping trips as well. When you go out, give them the freedom to browse the aisles and choose what they like.It may be a good idea to direct them toward a particular aisle and then give them some privacy. You could say, “Why don’t you hang out here and pick out a shaving cream that you like and anything else you want. I am going to head over to the frozen foods, just find me when you are done.” After you buy the products, if they plan on taking them to school, remind them that it is not a good idea to share hygiene items with others as you can get all sorts of infections and illnesses., You can also do some shopping on your own and stock your teen’s bathroom with an assortment of new products. Keep an eye on which ones they use and keep those filled. If they seem to avoid others, perhaps try a new brand or scent. Keep in mind that what you might buy for you might not be trendy or eye catching enough for your teen.If they ask about a particular product that you left out, you might say, “A friend told me that she loved that shampoo, so I thought you might like it too.”  , Schedule in particular times for certain aspects of hygienic care each day. That way your teen will know what to expect and is more likely to just go with the flow. Make sure that all members of your family participate and try to keep on track, even over holidays and school breaks.   For example, about 15 minutes before bed time make a point to encourage all of your family members to hit the bathroom and brush their teeth. You can also get them into a routine of making and keeping haircut appointments, dentist appointments, etc. After this routine is established, you can even have them start scheduling their own. This will be a helpful habit for them to have in adulthood.  Your teens are watching how you behave and will look to you as a role model. So, make sure to take time to take care of yourself, even if you are busy. Talk to them about the products that you enjoy or the medical appointments that you’ve scheduled. Tell them your opinions about your dentist and ask for theirs as well. Keep the bathroom door open, when reasonable, so your teen can watch you go about your routine., Offer sincere praise at regular intervals. However, make sure that you don’t draw too much of a contrast between past and present. Instead, talk about how they continue to improve as they mature and grow up. This will make them proud and more likely to follow your advice in the future.You might say, “I’m so happy that you’ve stopped biting your nails. I knew they would be beautiful if they grew out. Has it been hard to resist biting?”  , If you notice that the teen is also appearing downcast or depressed, then you may be dealing with a larger mental health issue. Try to observe the teen’s sleeping and eating patterns to get more of a clue regarding their overall mindset. If you continue to be concerned, seek out the help of a medical professional.Consider how you teen was about a year ago and see if there is a stark contrast in how they are now. This can be a clue that they are suffering.  If you are working with a teen who is special needs or has additional complicating issues, you may want to speak with a counselor or your pediatrician. They may be able to offer you additional modeling techniques. They can also assist in teaching the teen how to be aware of social cues indicating proper hygiene practices. 

ask them how you can help.  take your teens shopping for personal hygiene products.  leave interesting hygiene products in your teen’s bathroom.  make hygiene a part of your daily routine.  demonstrate personal hygiene habits in front of teens.  recognize and praise improvements in your teen’s hygiene.  watch out for other troubling behaviors.  make an appointment with a counselor.

 Steam cleaning uses hot water to deep clean your carpet and extract deeply embedded particles.You can purchase a steam cleaner and do this yourself. Before you steam clean, you need to vacuum and spot treat the stains on your carpet. Follow the manufacturer instructions for using your steam cleaner.   Pull the machine slowly as you go over your carpet. Only go over the area one time to limit the amount of water that you apply to the carpet. It is extremely important that you dry your carpet thoroughly. Not extracting all of the water can result in mold, mildew and odor. Open windows and use fans to speed up the drying process. If you do not want to purchase a steam cleaner, you can rent one from a local hardware store or carpet store.  Dry cleaning involves applying a dry powder to your carpet, working the powder into the carpet, and then vacuuming up the dry powder. The dry powder helps pull the dirt and soil out of the carpet. Vacuum your carpet before you apply the powder. Follow the instructions on the cleaner to determine how much you should use on your carpet.The instructions may recommend that you use a mechanical brush to work the powder into the carpet. However, the brushes should not be used on Berber as it may cause snags. Instead, work the powder gently in with your hands. Always read the label to determine how long to leave the powder on. Some powders require 20 to 30 minutes while other compounds may be vacuumed up immediately. This type of cleaning is recommended for Berber because there is not a risk of over-wetting the carpet and causing mold and mildew.  If your carpet is deeply stained or you are not comfortable using these methods on your own, hire a professional cleaner. A professional cleaner will assess the type of Berber you have and the condition of your carpet. The cleaner can then choose an appropriate cleaning method.   Use carpet cleaner that has experience working with Berber carpet. Visit the Institute of Inspection Cleaning and Restoration Cleaning website to find a certified carpet cleaner near you.

Microwaved carrots can be added to many meals as a side dish or vegetable accompaniment.  

place 1 pound/450g of cleaned carrots into a casserole dish or microwave dish.  cover the dish.  ,  microwave on high (100 percent power) until tender.  serve hot. 

 Do not mix anything into the bleach other than what is instructed with the directions of your bleach.  All bleach is caustic and can damage your skin leaving your fingers blistered, very sore, dry and discoloured. The bleach used in this process removes melanin so it will leave your fingers white, but the colour of your skin will return as your skin regenerates skin cells.  

follow the directions on the packaging.  make sure you wear gloves. 

 It not only captures their attention but also makes it easier for you to start a conversation. You may also have a higher chance of being paired up together, and you can discuss assignments and tests with them. You'll also be able to comment on what they say without looking weird.  There are a variety of different topics that you can talk about, but you can mostly focus on the ones that your crush is interested in. Try to come up with a new subject every time you talk to them. That way, they'll see you as an interesting, fun person and perhaps look forward to your conversations. You could also try asking them for help with a task, even if you don't need assistance. As long as it's believable, it should work as long as you don't do this too frequently. However, be sure that you show that you're intelligent. For instance, if you're a math whiz, don't ask your crush questions related to math.  You could also your crush about an assignment, which may open the way up to other subjects. Even if you're not in the same class, ask your crush about their lessons or what homework they have. However, be sure to talk about other topics so that you don't exhaust the current one.  In order to show them that you care, lend them pencils, paper, or any other supplies that they may need. Allow them to cry on your shoulder if something bad happens to them, and show them that you are a kind person. Be sure that you don't overdo it; otherwise, they may take advantage of your generosity.  A simple "hello" might lead to a conversation. Even if you don't have time to talk to them, quickly greet them to show that you're thinking of them. It may also grab their attention and cause them to think of you.  Add your crush to Facebook or other social networks you're both on. This is especially recommended if you both have mutual friends. This can lead the way to conversations outside of school, and you may be invited to events.  Now that you're talking to your crush, subtly flirt with them. This will help you get a sense of how interested they are in you, and you'll also show that you're attracted to them. If you get a positive response, continue flirting a bit and slowly increase it. However, if you feel that they aren't interested, tone it down a bit.  Although you may be attracted to them, you need to focus on your own life. They are just a person, and if they don't show interest, move on. No person is worth that much effort.  

sit next to your crush.  initiate conversations with your crush.  start conversations with school-related topics.  be kind to your crush.  greet them.  connect on social media.  flirt.  understand that your crush is human. 

 Try to remove as much of the urine as possible. This will ultimately make your job easier. Use clean paper towels and apply pressure. Repeat with new paper towels until you are unable to soak up any more urine.Skip this step if the urine has already dried. You can also use old throw away towels instead of paper ones. The thickness of regular towels allows for better absorption, soaking up more cat urine. If available, use a white towel. Once there's no longer a yellow-tint to the liquid being absorbed, you'll know all the urine has been absorbed.; , Enzymatic cleaners, like Nature's Miracle, contain special biological enzymes that break down the proteins in urine, reducing or even completely eliminating the smell.Note that some enzymatic cleaners may not work if other chemicals were used beforehand to try to treat the stain. It is generally a good idea to try the enzymatic cleaner first, and saturate the area well. Follow the manufacturer’s directions closely and allow to dry for several days. You may not have to do anything else.  If an enzyme cleaner didn't completely remove the smell, use a vinegar solution. Combine equal parts of white vinegar and water in a bowl or spray bottle. Saturate or spray the soiled area. Saturate a little bit beyond the soiled area so you can be sure to remove all urine.   If you have a black light or UV light at your disposal, you can see the urine glow in the dark and find the exact location of the urine spot.  Use a bristle brush and thoroughly rub the vinegar/water mixture until the area is completely soaked. The vinegar will neutralize the ammonia smell in your cat's urine., Again, use paper towels or a clean rag to blot up as much vinegar solution as possible. Let the area air dry completely after you've blotted it.  Wash the soiled area with a household cleaner that does not contain ammonia. Ammonia smells like urine to dogs and cats. Wipe the area clean with water. In a spray bottle, mix 10 parts water to 1 part bleach. Put on rubber gloves and spray the soiled area. Let the bleach sit for 30 seconds, then clean the soiled area with a damp cloth.   Be careful with the bleach as it may damage and change the color of some materials.  If any clothing has urine, add 1 cup (60 ml) of apple cider vinegar to the laundry detergent in your regular wash. If you still smell urine, add some enzymatic cleaner to your wash.Dry cleaning may be necessary. If you can't get the smell or stain out of an item, you may just have to throw it out.  Baking soda, also known as sodium bicarbonate, is a natural cleaner as well as an odor-absorber and deodorant.  Mix 1/2 cup of 3% hydrogen peroxide with one teaspoon (5 ml) of dish detergent and spread it over the baking soda.You may want to spot test this cleaning solution on an inconspicuous area at first to confirm that there is no discoloration.  Wear rubber gloves if possible, and wait for the telltale foaming action of the baking soda and hydrogen peroxide to kick in. , Vacuuming the soiled area removes both the urine particles and the deodorizer you applied. Extracting wet vacs work the best for this since they saturate the carpet and then vacuum the water back into the vacuum's tank.In a pinch, you can use your regular vacuum; it just won't be as effective as the wet vac.   For best results with a wet vac, use cool water in the vacuum tank and always follow the manufacturer's instructions. Avoid using steam cleaners, since the high heat will actually set the stain., Never yell or punish your cat for urinating in the wrong area. Instead, quickly move her to the litter box. Consistently take her to the litter box and give positive feedback when she uses it. This will reinforce a positive association with urinating and her litter box.  Cats like clean litter boxes, just as humans like clean bathrooms. If you're neglecting your cat's needs when it comes to offering a clean litter box, he may find it harder to resist urinating on your sofa or carpet.   Keep your cat's litter box in a quiet location that is not near its feeding area. This will increase the chance that the box will be used properly.  Cats that are spayed will not purposely urinate in order to mark their territory, solving the problem for you in the first place. Plus, you won't end up with a litter of kittens to potty train!  , While accidents do happen, particularly with young or even elderly animals, there may be a medical issue at the heart of the problem if you notice your pet urinating inappropriately. Contact your veterinarian to discuss possible medical reasons that your cat is urinating outside of the litter box. Ignoring a medical issue, such as a urinary tract infection, kidney disease or diabetes, could be life threatening for your pet.  

blot the urine on your carpet with paper towels.  use an enzymatic cleaner.  mix up a vinegar solution.  scrub the vinegar solution into the soiled area.  dry the area thoroughly.  disinfect hard surfaces.  check clothing for urine.  sprinkle baking soda over the area.  mix a small amount of hydrogen peroxide and mild dish detergent together.  use a scrub brush to rub the solution into to the baking soda.  blot the area and allow the mixture to dry.  ,  vacuum the soiled area.  re-train your cat.  replace the cat's litter box more often.  consider getting your cat neutered or spayed.  have your cat checked by the veterinarian. 

 A bacterial skin infection can occur on any part of the cat’s body, including its face and nose. Thoroughly check your cat’s whole body by running your hands over its fur as if you are petting it. Feel and examine the skin for itchy, red skin lesions, pustules (pimples), hair loss, open draining sores, and epidermal collarettes, i.e., a circular lesion with a circular rim containing scales or peeling edges.Skin folds can develop bacterial skin infections as well. If your cat has skin folds, make sure to look under the skin folds for lesions, pustules, and sores. Bites and scratches from other animals can also cause skin infections and abscesses. Monitor these closely.; , Try to determine if your cat began itching before or after the infection developed. If your cat began itching before the infection developed, then the cause of the infection is most likely environmental. If your cat began itching the affected area after it developed, then the cause of the infection is most likely due to internal factors., Cats who have deep pyoderma, a severe skin infection, may have open draining sores and a fever. Signs of a fever in cats are a loss of appetite, as well as depressed, lethargic, quiet, and withdrawn behavior. A cat with a fever may or may not feel warm to the touch.Other symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, pale gums, and weakness.  Because it is difficult to differentiate between a bacterial and fungal infection, you will need to take your cat to the vet once a problem is identified. Your vet will also be able to test whether the infection is caused by environmental factors or internal factors. The vet is not able to prescribe medication until they have performed an examination. The tests may include:A microscopic examination of the pustules and/or discharge. Antibiotic sensitivity and culture tests to pinpoint the bacteria causing the infection. This can include skin scrapings and fungal cultures to rule out fungal infections and microscopic parasites. Food trials and allergy testing to exclude food allergies as the cause. The use of a flea comb to examine the skin and hair for lice and fleas. Blood tests to identify any internal causes.  

examine your cat’s skin.  monitor your cat’s itching.  check to see if your cat has a fever.  consult your vet. 

 There are many different credit card companies offering cash-back rewards cards. The best way to start when researching these offers is by searching online. There you'll get a comprehensive listing of every company offering cash-back credit cards, and you'll be able to read the specific terms and conditions of each card.   Search online for "cash back credit card" or "best cash back credit card offers" to see a comprehensive listing.; , Before you sign up for a cash-back credit card (or any credit card, for that matter), you should look into the terms and conditions of that card. Many cards have offers that expire after several months to a year, while even otherwise good rewards cards have limits to what you can get cash back on.Some cards offering higher cash-back rates often have restrictions on where they can be used. For example, a card that offers 3% may only give that rate for groceries; all other purchases may be just 1% cash back. There may be limits to how much you can reclaim on a cash-back rewards card. Once you pass that limit, your rewards percentage may lower considerably.Cards with specific business or category affiliations often get a higher percentage back from each purchase than a general cash-back card.Certain cards rotate out which category or categories they offer the highest rewards for, which may make it difficult to consistently get the best rewards.  Stiff penalties and high fees can quickly outweigh the benefits you receive from a cash-back credit card. Before you commit to a given credit card, look at how much you'll have to pay in annual and monthly fees, as well as any potential penalties that are imposed for late payments or periods of inactivity.Some cards make you forfeit accumulated rewards and rebates if you miss consecutive payments or have a prolonged period of card inactivity. Depending on the credit card company you're considering, you may have to agree to an inflated annual fee to get the most out of your cash-back card. For example, one American Express card only charges annual fees for the "Preferred version," which doubles your rebate on certain items but charges a $75 annual fee. Depending on how often you make purchases and use rewards, this may or may not be worth it.  The APR is the rate of interest charged each year on purchases you make with your card. Most cards have a fixed APR for the year, though you may be able to avoid paying that interest for many credit cards.Some credit card companies assign an APR to your card based on your credit score. There may be multiple tiers of percentage rates, depending on how well you score. Many credit card companies do not impose interest on your purchases if you are consistently diligent in paying off your monthly balance, but not all cards. Ask about the APR for any card you're considering.  Getting cash back for your purchases may sound like free and easy money. However, there can be significant out-of-pocket costs associated with your card, depending on what you qualify for. If you have good credit, use your card frequently, and pay off your bills on time each month, the rewards may outweigh the costs. If not, though, you may end up paying considerable fees.Foreign transaction fees are assessed when you use your card while traveling in a foreign country. Some cards charge a foreign transaction fee, while others do not. Those that do charge a fee often vary, but it's best to find a fee below 3%. There are also a number of "travel" credit cards that do not charge a foreign transaction fee.Many of the best rewards offers require excellent credit.Depending on your credit score, you may not be eligible for these deals, and you may have to settle for a less-rewarding card.  Any time you apply for a credit card, the credit card company you apply with runs a credit check on you. Having outstanding debts can significantly lower your credit score and may even flag you as a high risk.Make sure you are in good standing with all of your creditors before you begin the credit card application process. That way your credit check will come back with a higher rating, and you may even be eligible for a better interest rate or card option.  If a lender runs a comprehensive credit search, your credit may be affected in the future if that lender uncovers a bad credit history. When you pre-apply for a credit card, a "soft" credit search is run. Only you see your credit search, which means that your future credit won't be affected. This can give you the opportunity to put off applying and pay off your debts so that you will be approved when you do apply in the future.If you're approved, you can go ahead and apply. If not, you'll need to fix your credit before applying again.  Once you've settled on a card and you've gotten your finances in order, you're ready to apply for your own cash-back credit card. The easiest way to apply is by going online and visiting that card company's website. From there you can fill out an online application form, and you'll typically find out if you're approved as soon as you submit your information.You'll need to enter some personal information, including your name, address, phone number, and social security number. In order to check your credit, most card companies will also ask for your bank account information and details about your employment history and income. If you're approved, your card will arrive in the mail shortly. If not, you should call the card company to find out why so that you can make any necessary arrangements.  The easiest way to rack up rewards is by using your card consistently. You can use your card for everyday purchases, but if your card offers higher rewards through certain vendors or types of stores you should make a point of making purchases there.You can typically use your credit card anyplace that you would otherwise pay with cash, debit cards, or personal checks. Check to see if most vendors accept your card. Some credit cards, like American Express, are not as widely accepted as some of their competitors, such as Visa or MasterCard., Most credit cards charge a fee for withdrawing cash. However, it's particularly ill-advised for a cash-back credit card. The fees and potential interest charged for getting cash back may end up outweighing the cash-back rewards you accrue., Cash-back credit cards can be a great perk for smart shoppers. If you're not careful, though, you could end up forfeiting a lot of the rebates you rack up. Canceling your card can also have negative repercussions for your overall credit score. If you want to maintain your credit and keep your rewards, you'll need to keep your card active and use it regularly.If you don't use your card frequently enough, you may end up losing your rebates. However, overspending just to get a rebate could deplete your savings. Try to find a balance by using the card regularly without overspending. If you need help, you can contact a credit counseling agency to help you manage your finances. Canceling a credit card may cause your credit score to go down. It's best to keep your card active and use it regularly, even if it's just for small purchases.  Failing to pay off your bill for two or more consecutive months could cause you to lose your accrued rewards. Maintaining a debt for prolonged periods of time can also negatively affect your credit score. The best way to ensure that your bills get paid on time each month is to set up a direct debit payment through your bank.Most financial institutions that offer online banking give you the option of setting up automatic monthly payments for bills, utilities, or even rent payments. Make sure your payment and billing information is up to date to ensure your monthly payments wipe out your bills.  

compare credit card offers.  read the fine print on cash-back rewards.  look at any annual fees and penalties that are imposed.  check the annual percentage rate (apr) imposed on purchases.  recognize that it's not necessarily free money.  sort out any outstanding debts.  pre-apply to check your credit eligibility.  apply for the card of your choice.  use your card for all normal purchases and expenses.  avoid withdrawing cash with your card.  protect the benefits of your cash-back card.  set up a direct debit to pay your monthly balance in full.

 Besides all the other health benefits of drinking water, it will also help keep your metabolism up. When the body gets dehydrated, metabolism slows down. This means you won't burn as many calories, making it harder for you to lose the weight you want to., While protein is important for building muscles, it also helps keep your metabolism high. This is because the body burns a lot of calories digesting it, so your metabolic rate will stay high if protein is a normal part of your diet.Good sources of protein are chicken, fish like salmon and sardines, eggs, tofu, low-fat milk, low-fat cottage cheese, nuts, and beans.  Heart disease is the number one killer of men in the United States, and diets high in saturated fats and cholesterol are a chief contributor to heart disease. Good fats, like mono- and polyunsaturated fats, lower cholesterol and decrease your risk of heart disease.Sources of good fats include oily fish like salmon and sardines, olive oil, avocados, and nuts. Even when you're eating good fats, make sure no more than 25-35% of your overall calories come from fat. Any more will lead to weight gain.  Iron deficiency will slow down your metabolism, so you'll want to get plenty of this nutrient in your diet. Some good sources of iron are shellfish. red meat, lentils, beans, and spinach., Carbohydrates are important for a diet geared towards building muscle. Without carbs, your body will burn protein for energy, which means that the protein won't go towards building your muscles. There are two kinds of carbs, however. Complex carbohydrates take longer for your body to digest than simple carbs. As a result, your body's metabolic rate will remain high if you eat these foods.Good sources of complex carbs include whole grain products, starchy vegetables, green leafy vegetables, and beans., Spicy foods like chili peppers give your metabolism a short boost right after eating. It doesn't last very long, but eating spices regularly can have a sustained effect on your metabolism. Try adding a scoop or two of chili powder to your meals to add flavor and give your metabolism a boost., Although men usually love a good steak, red meat is not the best choice for your health.Satisfy your meat craving with lean meat like poultry, and keep red meat down to 3 servings per week.   You don't need to cut out red meat entirely. Extra lean cuts of beef and pork will provide much less fat and cholesterol, which is good for your waistline and overall health.The USDA considers an extra lean cut of meat as follows: for every 100 grams of meat, there are no more than 5 grams of total fat, 2 grams of saturated fat, and 95 milligrams of cholesterol., It's very important to keep track of your calories to avoid overeating. Make sure to read all food labels and write down everything you eat. This will help you keep your eating under control by showing you where you stand in relation to your daily maximum. Keep your count low by swapping high-calorie, low-nutrition items for nutrient-dense, low-calorie foods and snacks.Also check for apps that will help you track your calories. There are several of these that will give you an accurate measure of what you've consumed., Some people think that eating very few calories every day will help them lose weight. While you'll probably see some weight loss from this, it is overall counterproductive. First of all, it slows down your metabolism, so the calories you do eat stay around longer. Second, you'll probably lose muscle as well, which means your body won't burn as many calories. If you want to lose weight, crash dieting is not the way to do it. 

stay well hydrated.  eat plenty of protein.  eat good fats.  include iron in your diet.  eat complex carbohydrates.  add spices to your meals.  eat lean meats.  count your calories.  avoid crash dieting. 

 Sometimes an interviewer will ask you a question that is entirely unrelated to your industry or to the job that you're applying for. This is usually to see how you handle pressure and how you will react to the situation. The most important thing is to stay calm and to act like the question doesn't phase you.Hiring managers want to see if you will become flustered or frustrated by the question.  If you can, try to answer the question by thinking of a situation in your life that relates to it. For example, the hiring managers at Mastercard ask employees "What do you do if you are approached by an employee who is complaining about a colleague who has horrible body odor?" You could answer by saying something like "Well, I actually had this issue in Highschool, and I was the smelly kid. The kids actually got me more interested in different sprays and colognes while we were in the locker room, and it helped me a lot. So I'd probably do something like that.", Sometimes these questions are aimed to see what kind of person you'd be like to work with. For that reason, when given a strange or curveball question, just try to answer truthfully without coming off as disrespectful.   For example, Whole Foods Market hiring managers ask "Would you rather fight 1 horse-sized duck, or 100 duck-sized horses?" You could say something like, "A horse-sized duck would be terrifying and horrifying. I'd definitely go with the 100 duck-sized horses." 

stay calm.  use a past experience to answer the question.  try to answer truthfully. 

 Example: Did you insult your friend? Did she/he insult you? Do you feel that your friend doesn't like you anymore, or are you just tired of each other? To solve the problem, you must first assess the situation.; , Obviously, landing up at her/his house at 2 a.m isn't the right choice, why not give your friend a call, or send a letter, or an email. With all this cool technology these days, there are at least a million options you could choose from.  Apologize for any mistake. Present your views in a diplomatic manner, and even if she/he does not do so, you should refrain from screaming, swearing or others of the like. That is definitely not going to help!  , It's important for you to know what you have done wrong so you can correct your mistakes and lead a happy relationship!  , Don't immediately go back to your usual self. Take some time to mend your ways, they will do the same, and then you can resume your friendship!  

think about the problem.  be brave and make the first move.think of ways to present your thoughts to your friend.  make sure to be the more mature person.  after you have given your friend your view of the problem, ask her/him what she/he thinks.  after the problem has been solved, give your friend some time to think over. 

 There are several benefits to having your cat come to you when you call her. For example, you can call her when it’s playtime or mealtime.You can also call your cat if you are unable to locate her in your home.In addition, when your cat knows how to come to you when you call her, you will have the reassurance that she is safely accounted for if you have to leave the house.If your cat is indoor/outdoor, it will be helpful to call her to come back inside.Calling your cat is also beneficial when it is time to leave the house for her veterinary appointment.Your cat may not view a trip to the veterinarian as a pleasant experience, so you may need to allow some extra time to get her come to you when it’s time to leave for her appointment. Because cats are naturally intelligent, teaching your cat to come to you when she is called is a great mental exercise for her.; , Although positive reinforcement (verbal praise, petting) is an important component of successful training, the key to training your cat to respond to your call is an enticing reward.The most enticing reward for her will probably be food that she thinks is delicious, such as tuna, shredded chicken, or sardines.You can also purchase cat treats at your local pet store.Keep multiple treats on hand. When you reward her, you can vary which food you reward her with so that she does not come to expect the same reward each time.Catnip is not a good reward. Your cat’s desire for catnip would likely diminish if she receives it more than once a week, so it would be best to select a food treat that will consistently entice her.Whichever food reward you choose, use it only when you call her. It is preferable for your cat to associate that tasty reward with responding to your call and no other commands or verbal cues.Playtime can also be an enticing reward., You can use any verbal cue that you would like.One common verbal cue that cat owners will use is “Here, kitty kitty.” You can also use the words “come” or “treats.”The verbal cue should not be something that you already use, such as her name.You can also use various tones of voice. Cats typically respond to a high-pitched tone of voice, since their prey usually makes high-pitched sounds in the wild.If you are not the only person in the house who would be calling your cat, make sure that everyone uses the same verbal cue and tone to call her.If your cat is deaf or hard of hearing, you will need to use some different methods to get her attention, such as visual cues– flicking a light on and off or using a laser pointer (available at your local pet store). Deaf or hearing-impaired cats also respond to vibrations in the floor, so you can thump or stomp of the floor to call your cat., A convenient time to practice calling your cat is around feeding time. Your cat will likely already be hungry, which may make the training process easier and faster.In addition, she will already be used to going to the kitchen (or wherever you keep her food bowl), so you will not be calling her to a room that is unfamiliar to her when you begin training her.   Another benefit to calling her at her regular feeding time is that she will already know what time to get her food.This will make the initial training easier because you will not be doing something that is completely unfamiliar to her. If you choose to reward with her extra play, then you can practice calling her when it’s getting close to her scheduled playtime.If the kitchen and her play areas have a lot of distractions, consider calling your cat in a quiet room that doesn’t have any distractions that could keep her from coming to you., When you are in the room where you want her to come to you, say your verbal cue in a high-pitched voice. If you are calling her when it’s time for her to eat, make sure that you say the verbal cue before you open a can of food or rip open a bag of food. You want to ensure that your cat comes because she heard your verbal cue, not because of the noises of food preparation.Reward her immediately when she comes to you, whether that is with the tasty treat or extra playtime.Extra positive reinforcement through petting and verbal praise will also be helpful. Even if you are calling her at mealtime, it is still important to give her the tasty treat as a reward, rather than just feeding her the regular food. If you are calling her around playtime, say the verbal cue without shaking a toy that makes noise. It may take her a week or so before she starts to consistently come to you when you call her., Once your cat consistently comes to her play or feeding areas when you call her, take the difficulty up a notch. For example, if someone else lives with you, you can practice calling her back and forth between you and other person. For this challenge, each person should reward her when she correctly responds to the call.If your cat is indoor/outdoor, you can also practice calling her back inside when she is outside.This would be more practical when she is a relatively close distance to the house where she could hear you. Practice calling her from each of the rooms in your house. Eventually, she will learn how to come to you from wherever she is in your house. 

learn the benefits of calling your cat.  select a reward.  decide what verbal cue you will use to call your cat.  choose when you are going to call your cat.  call your cat.  increase the challenge of calling your cat. 

 The exhaustion that your mom had at the beginning of pregnancy has probably come back. Unfortunately, insomnia is common at this stage, and so is discomfort due to the baby’s size, so it will likely be hard for her to get good sleep.Give her permission to take a nap if needed.   Mood swings and just general grumpiness have probably come back.She is uncomfortable and not sleeping well. Do your best to remind yourself (and her) that this is temporary.  Have you noticed how much stuff babies need? You can help make things a little easier on your mom by offering to help her prepare for your little brother or sister’s arrival. There is a lot to be done. Here are some ways you can help:   Help prepare the nursery. This could be anything from painting the room, putting together a piece of furniture, or washing and putting away baby clothes. Throw a baby shower. Help plan a party for her family and friends to celebrate this exciting time. Help her pack her hospital bag.  Before the baby’s birth, you may notice your mom bustling about, getting the house perfectly clean, cooking meals for after the baby comes, or tackling a big project. This burst of energy is called nesting. It’s very common for a pregnant mom to want everything to be just perfect for the baby’s arrival.Be patient with her, and try to find some humor in it.  

let her rest.  get everything ready.  know your mom isn’t crazy. 

 Lightly coat a 2-quart (1.89 liters) casserole dish with some butter. Set the dish aside.; , Fill a large pot with 4 quarts (3.79 liters) of water and bring it to a boil. Add some salt and macaroni, and cook it for about 5 to 7 minutes. The macaroni will continue cooking in the oven.  Place a large strainer or colander in the sink and pour the macaroni into it. Shake the strainer a little to get rid of any excess water.  Melt the butter in the saucepan and stir in the flour, salt, and pepper using a whisk. Cook the roux over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the flour turns a light brown and bubbles start to form.The saucepan has to be large enough to hold the milk, cheese, and macaroni. You will be mixing everything in this.  Pour in 1 cup (240 milliliters) of milk and stir it with a whisk to combine. Pour in the remaining milk and continue stirring.Be sure to break up any lumps or clumps of flour.,,, Switch the whisk out for a wooden spoon for this so that the macaroni doesn't get caught in it.  Tilt the saucepan over the casserole dish, and use your wooden spoon to help spread it in an even layer across the bottom. of the dish. If you'd like, you can sprinkle some extra cheese on top for that extra-crispy layer.  If you do not want the top to be crispy, cover the dish with a sheet of tin foil for the first 30 minutes of baking.Once the casserole is baked, put it out of the oven using oven mitts. 

preheat the oven to 350°f (176°c) and prepare your baking dish.  cook the macaroni according to the directions on the package until it is just cooked.  drain the macaroni and set it aside.  prepare the roux in a large saucepan.  whisk in the milk a little bit at a time.  cook the milk mixture, covered, for about 6 minutes.you are ready for the next step when the milk mixture starts to bubble and thicken.  ,  stir in the shredded cheese, and cook until it is melted and smooth.the most popular cheese to use is cheddar, but you can also try other types of cheese as well, including sharp cheddar, fontina, gruyère, cheddar, and parmesan.you can even use a combination of different cheeses.  ,  add the macaroni and stir it again until the cheese sauce coats it evenly.  transfer the macaroni into the casserole dish.  bake for it for 40 to 45 minutes.the top will turn bubbly, crispy, and golden.  let the macaroni and cheese cool for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.cover and store any leftovers in the fridge, and reheat them the next day in the microwave.  

 Over time, you can increase your vocal range by stretching one note (or one half-note) higher and lower than what you can sing comfortably. Focus on proper breathing while singing. Keep your air supply steady so that the note doesn't crack or become airy.Don't do too much too fast, as you can hurt your voice. Carey purportedly has a 5-octave range. While that range is impossible for most people, you can probably reach 3 octaves, especially with the help of an expert., Make a grunting noise ("uh-uh") then switch to singing a note with the word "mom." This activity shortens your vocal cords, which makes it easier to hit the high notes., Arpeggios go up and then down (do-mi-sol-do-sol-mi-do, in solfege syllables, or 1-3-5-8-5-3-1, in terms of scale degrees), modulating a half step up after each arpeggio. They can help increase the top half of your range., A voice teacher can help you improve your technique, so that you can comfortably increase your range.Your voice teacher may have you do some of these same exercises. However, the benefit of having a teacher around is that he or she can hear when you're making a mistake and work to correct it. As an amateur, you may not know when you are making a mistake, and so you may let it develop into a bad habit.  

gradually sing notes higher and lower.  try compressed grunts.  use octave arpeggio exercises.  take vocal lessons. 

 Choose a vine with slipping bark, then cut away the top of the vine with a saw.   This method is also among the simplest grafting methods for grape vines, but it tends to be slightly less particular and slightly less successful than cleft grafting. Bark slipping occurs when the bark actually begins to separate and peel away from the wood of the vine. Ideally, you should wait until all of the bark on a vine begins to split before trying to use this grafting method. You only need to cut 4 inches (10 cm) or so from the top of the vine. You can cut more if you desire a shorter head height, though.  Select a dormant scion and slice off a portion of bark and wood along the bottom half of the shoot using a sharp, clean blade.   This cut should be about 2 inches (4 cm) long and should be straight yet slanted. For best results, position this cut on the opposite side of the bud.Make a secondary cut on the opposite (bud) side of the scion. This cut should be similar in shape but only one-third the length of the primary cut.  Use the same blade to cut into the side of the rootstock, near the cut top. The portion you cut away should match the shape and size of the portion removed from the scion.   Remove the loose outer bark from the intended grafting location. Hold the cut edge of the scion against the intended grafting location on the stock. Cut a slit into the bark on both sides. The slit should be as wide as the diameter of the scion and as deep as the full scion length.  Slip the cut surface of the scion into the newly cut wedge of in the rootstock.   You may need to use a flat screwdriver to help you peel away the flap of bark on the stock. Roughly one-third to one-half of this flap should be removed before you place the scion into the wedge. The long side of the scion should be placed against the trunk of the stock.  Wrap the grafted vines together with a durable rubber band or heavy-duty tape. Seal the entire exposed area with grafting compound.   For additional security, hold the graft together with 1-inch (2.5-cm) long brads or staples from a staple gun. Seal as normal, then apply latex paint over the dried grafting compound.  

remove the top of the vine.  cut a pattern into the basal end of the scion.  make a matching cut in the stock.  insert the scion into the cut.  seal the grafted area. 

 Are you ready to be the owner of a land turtle? They live a long time, can grow quite large, are not great pets for young children, and their care and feeding can be quite expensive (special lights, enclosures, vet visits). Because of their longevity, you also need to realize that your tortoise, if well cared for, can easily outlive you. , Turtles are omnivores and require some time in the water. Tortoises are herbivores and are land-based. Both require appropriate outdoor and indoor environments and need good and attentive care if they are to thrive. Land turtles may have the reputation as an “easy” pet, but they actually require quite a bit of work. , Observe the pets, and look at photos of some possibilities. Which ones do you like? Which ones do long-time turtle keepers recommend? If it’s your first turtle, you also should ask which ones are easiest to care for and best for first-time owners.  Land turtles, when cared for properly, need to be outside at least part of the time. Choose a turtle that can thrive where you live. This means if you live in a humid place, choose a turtle that likes those conditions. Get a turtle that thrives in arid places if you live in the desert. This will make it much easier to care for your turtle because you won’t have to create a new outdoor environment for the turtle and keep it regulated.  This is essential if you might move, changing the environment to which the turtle is exposed. Trying to create a new outdoor-like environment for a humidity-loving turtle in a snowy climate can get very difficult and expensive. , Just as choosing a turtle that thrives in your outdoor environment makes caring for it much easier, so too does choosing a turtle native to your country and region. Not all areas have native land turtles, but ask around for the turtles most likely to thrive in your area.  Turtles from elsewhere are often taken from the wild, leading to the depletion of native turtle and tortoise populations around the world. For the health of the environment and native turtles, domestically-bred turtles or rescued turtles are the best choice., It needs to be watertight. There are many possible ways to make an enclosure, but it needs to be quite large, even for small turtles -- many sources say that you can start in a large and deep plastic tub, but will need to make much larger enclosures as your turtle grows. You can make a dedicated turtle table out of wood, repurpose an old bookshelf with the shelves removed, or use a plastic kiddie pool. Your ultimate choice will depend on the species of land turtle. , Turtles have specific needs, and the exact specifications will vary depending on the turtle you choose. Make sure you have everything in place before you get your turtle. You can’t just get the different parts together as you go -- the turtles will need everything immediately.  Turtles will need substrate, which allows them to dig, and can also help in waste disposal. It’s vital that you choose a good-quality and appropriate substrate, because they will have so much contact with it. , Turtles need lights that provide UV-B so that they get Vitamin B. Keep in mind you’ll need to purchase new light bulbs every 6 months to a year because they lose their ability to produce UV-B.. , Different turtles need different levels of humidity, so check the needs of your species. It could be low, middle, or high, depending on the native environment of your turtle. Most will need some kind of misting on their substrate. , You might have to buy a heat lamp for the proper environment for your turtle or tortoise. Particularly if you have a turtle that is not native to your area, heat might prove to be the most essential element for your land turtle. , Box turtles and tortoises should have some kind of water in their structures. Again, it will depend on the species, but all will need a shallow water dish or bowl to soak in (and possibly defecate into). , This is an essential part of the way turtles interact with their environment. It could be as simple as a small plastic box or bowl with a hole cut in the side. , This will be just as important for many land turtle species as the indoor enclosure. Make sure yours is large and safe. Turtles need to be protected from predators and from escape. Your enclosure should be tall enough they cannot escape over it, and have barriers under the dirt so they can’t burrow under. A roof for the enclosure is also typically a necessity. , Do not just use the dirt you have in your backyard -- it’s not appropriate for land turtles. Be advised that grass, particularly wet grass, is also bad for land turtles. It can cause painful abrasions. , Since your turtle will be spending a lot of time outdoors, planting food for them makes a lot of sense. You won’t have to look for food for them, and they can choose to eat when they want to. , Don’t just have a flat and boring outdoor enclosure. Create little hills they can climb, different areas to explore, and a variety of environments within the enclosure. , Too much of some nutrients like calcium or protein can severely stunt or even kill your land turtle. Keep in mind that tortoises are herbivores, while box turtles are omnivores. You should give box turtles slugs, snails, crickets and other animal matter twice a week. The rest of the time they will eat fruits like melon, berries, and tomatoes. Greens are also a great addition to a turtle’s diet. Tortoises do not eat any animal matter, but their diets are quite varied. Please do the research to determine what diet is best for your particular species of tortoise. , Hibernation is a contested issue among turtle owners. Talk to your veterinarian to see if your land turtle should be hibernating. Keep in mind that turtles who do not have enough fat reserves can easily die if they are in hibernation. Hibernation is also not recommended for turtles who might be at all medically compromised. Some turtle experts caution against hibernation at all. If you do choose to hibernate your land turtle, prepare your turtle habitat carefully. You might even need to build a special hibernation box, depending on the species. It needs to be in a place that is temperature-regulated and will not flood. Stop feeding your land turtle two weeks before planned hibernation, and start lowering the temperature in the habitat slightly. Hibernation can last from 3-5 months. Be sure to check the temperature requirements for your particular type of land turtle. , Land turtles should not be in homes that have dogs (possible predators of turtles). Keep in mind that infants and children are also not ideal companions for turtles. Many experts recommend that only children over 12 years old have contact with land turtles. Most small turtles are carriers of salmonella, an infection that can possibly be fatal to infants, the elderly, and the medically fragile. Even if your turtle is not in the “small turtle” category, there is still a risk of the turtle passing on infections to children. , The majority of turtles carry parasites and possibly other infections, some of which can be dangerous to humans. Depending on where you got your turtle from, it might be at risk for malnourishment and dehydration. With turtles, it can be difficult for you to tell if they are having problems, so choose a good exotic animal veterinarian. , Most land turtles will grow a lot as they grow older. This doesn't means you need to be attuned to the ways you will need to change their living environments, both inside and outside, and their feeding and possible hibernation. Turtles need 3 square feet of floor space for each 8 inches of turtle length. For tortoises, it’s even more -- a minimum of 3 square yards of floor space for each 12 inches of length.  

investigate your choices.  decide if you want a turtle or tortoise.  visit turtle breeders and talk to other turtle owners online.  keep in mind the climate where you live.  choose smaller land turtles.  look for native land turtles.  buy a turtle from a breeder or rescue organization.  create the indoor enclosure for your turtle.  add elements to the indoor structure.  purchase the appropriate dirt product for the kind of turtle you have.  buy special lights for your land turtle.  add humidity based on your type of land turtle.  keep your land turtle at the appropriate temperature for their species.  include water.  create a place for your turtle to hide.  create the outdoor enclosure for your turtle.  make sure you use substrate as the base of the enclosure.  include plants that the land turtles like to eat.  create places for them to hide and explore -- rocks, wood, etc.  feed your tortoise or box turtle an appropriate diet.  consider whether you want your land turtle to hibernate.  create a healthy environment for your turtle and your family.  make regular trips to veterinarian with your land turtle.  do not change your pet’s environment as he or she grows. 

 We all have egos, and sometimes they get over-inflated. It’s part of human nature to believe others perceive us the same way that we do and that they want to be like us. This may not be the case. Ask your other friends to see if they’ve noticed copying. If they haven’t noticed anything, drop it. If it becomes a more serious situation, they’ll bring it up.; , Reframe the situation: instead of thinking of your friend as copying you, you could take it as your friend admiring your good judgment and taste. Maybe they simply need someone to look up to—especially if they’ve just lost one—and they’ve chosen you. While it might be annoying, it may be a temporary thing. Don’t be too quick to react on this situation because it may result in the loss of a friend., While copying can feel a bit like identity theft, there might be something else bothering you. If this other problem is being projected onto the copying problem, the copying problem seems worse than it truly is. If something else is bothering you, don’t take it out on your friend. Let them have their moment and focus on yourself. Just because they wore the same color shirt as you did to school, or said they had the same favorite meal, doesn’t make them a copier.  Discuss it with them. They might not even realize that they’re copying you. Sit down with them and make sure they’re aware of it and divulge into potential reasons for it. Don’t attack them, make it a discussion.   ”Did you notice that we’ve been matching a lot lately?”  If they say no, give them examples.   ”Do you think it’s funny that we always end up doing the same thing?” ”Why do you think these things happen?”  , Ask them how they describe their style or personality. If they have trouble doing so, it’ll help them see that they’ve been copying you. Remember, it’s likely there will be similarities between you—that’s why you’re friends—but they should also have some original ideas.   ”The whole point of clothes is to highlight your own unique style, how do you think you’d describe your style.” ”How do you see yourself?”  , Give them examples of things they’ve thought of on their own that you liked. Show them that they also have good, original ideas. Be vague when you do this, so that you don’t give away all of your preferences., This is going to be the turning point to make them stop copying you. Once you make them aware of the situation, you need to let them carry the conversation. This will show them that they have the ability to form their own ideas and that will carry over into whatever aspect of life they’ve been copying from you.  If they’ve been copying your outfits, go through their closet with them. Have them create outfits without your help and point out good things about them. If they’ve been copying the way you act, leave it to them to make the first move and agree with whatever they choose. Give them confidence in their decision-making, and they’ll be less likely to copy you., If they truly seem to have difficulty understanding that they’re copying you, don’t tell them your plans. Secrets are never good for a friendship, but you may have to keep some so that they make choices for themselves. Make them decide on upcoming plans and purchases. Don’t give them an answer about where you want to go or what you want to do. Let them do it.  Continue to point out what you like about their style or ideas. Keep in mind that people that copy chronically typical suffer from extreme insecurity. They have low self-esteem. Get your mutual friends in on it to help build their confidence. Support them in every choice they make, even if it seems over the top. This will help them become a confident, independent person., This is an easy way to build self-esteem. When you do something you enjoy doing, it’s something that gives you comfort and confidence. Help your friend do something they like to do every single day. 

figure out if they’re actually copying you.  think about how big of a problem it is.  consider if something else is bothering you.  ask them about it.  talk about their originality.  point out what you like about them.  let them talk.  help them discover their uniqueness.  force them to do their own thing.  build their confidence.  make sure they do things they like to do. 

 In order to solve any physics problem you must know which equation to use. Writing down all of the known information is the first step to finding the right equation. If you have values for the final velocity, acceleration, and time involved, you can use the following equation:   Initial velocity: Vi = Vf - (a * t)  Understand what each symbol stands for.   Vi stands for “initial velocity”  Vf stands for “final velocity”  a stands for “acceleration”  t stands for “time”   Note that this equation is the standard equation used when finding initial velocity.; , Once you have written the known information and determined the proper equation, you can fill in values for the appropriate variables. Carefully setting up each problem and writing out every step of the process is important.   If you make a mistake, you can easily find it by looking back at all of your previous steps.  With all of the numbers in place, use the proper order of operations to finish the problem. If you’re allowed, use a calculator to limit the number of simple math mistakes.   For example: An object accelerating east at 10 meters (32.8 ft) per second squared traveled for 12 seconds reaching a final velocity of 200 meters (656.2 ft) per second. Find the initial velocity of that object.  Write the known information:  Vi = ?, Vf = 200 m/s, a = 10 m/s2, t = 12 s   Multiply the acceleration and time. a * t = 10 * 12 =120 Subtract the product from the final velocity. Vi = Vf – (a * t) = 200 – 120 = 80 Vi = 80 m/s east Write your answer correctly. Include a unit of measurement, usually meters per second or m/s, as well as a direction the object was traveling in. Without providing information about the direction, you only have a measurement of speed rather than velocity.  

know the right equation to use.  fill in the known information.  solve the equation. 

 Smoke bombs are composed of a simple concoction of potassium nitrate and sugar. By mixing these ingredients and melting them together, you create a flammable product that produces whirls of smoke when you light it on fire. Here's what you'll need:  Buy potassium nitrate, also called saltpeter, online. You can also find it at your local garden store, since it's used to treat soil.       Get some sugar. Dark brown sugar is said to make the smoke look thicker, but white will also do just fine.       Pick up some baking soda. Adding a tablespoon or so will make the smoke take a bit longer to burn.       Get a small length of fuse to insert in the smoke bomb.       Obtain a cast iron skillet. Prepare a cardboard box lined with aluminum foil.  Don some gloves, goggles, and a filter mask.  Measure out three parts saltpeter to two parts sugar.  Stir the mixture constantly until the mixture is completely melted. As the sugar caramelizes, it should take on a brown or black color.   Do not overcook the mixture. Take care not to let it start on fire. If it starts to smoke, turn off the heat immediately. ,,, It might take an hour or so to solidify.  Take it to the desired location and light the fuse.  

gather supplies.  put on your safety gear.  place the ingredients in a cast iron pot.  heat the pan slowly over low flame.  add one spoonful of baking soda.  ,  carefully pour the mixture into the cardboard box.  ,  insert a fuse while the mixture is still soft.  ,  let the mixture completely harden.  set up the smoke bomb in a safe place outdoors.

 To start, heat your olive oil in a sauce pan or spray it with non-stick cooking spray for an even lower fat version. Add your onions to the pan and sauté them for about 10 minutes. They should be softened slightly when they're done. Then, add your parsnips and sauté them as well.To lower the carb count of this recipe, you could leave out the parsnips or substitute another vegetable. Parsnips have about 21 net carbs per serving.Try subbing cauliflower, which has only 5 grams of carbohydrate per cup., Add the curry paste and the tomatoes. Mix everything together and then add the salt and one and a half canfuls of water.Bring the curry mixture to a boil. Then, reduce the heat and simmer the mixture. Simmer everything for about 15 to 20 minutes or until the parsnips are tender.  Stir the curry chunks into the mixture. Simmer until the turkey is heated through. This should take about five more minutes., Remove the curry from the heat once the turkey is cooked through. Then, stir in the yogurt. Your curry is now done. It can be served with basmati rice.This recipe serves four people. One serving contains about 400 calories, 15 grams of fat, and 27 carbohydrates. However, if you substituted cauliflower for the parsnips or just left out the parsnips, then that cuts the carbs down by about half.  

sauté your onions and parsnips.  stir the tomatoes and curry paste together.  add the turkey.  stir in the yogurt. 

 Wheatgrass seeds are also called hard winter wheat seed or wheat berries. Buy a bag of seeds online or at a health supply store. Look for organic seeds from a reputable source to make sure the seeds haven't been treated with pesticides and will grow into healthy, vibrant grass., Before the seeds can be soaked and germinated, they need to be measured and rinsed.   Measure out enough seeds to create a light layer on the seed tray you use to grow the grass. For a 16" x 16" tray, use about two cups of seeds. Rinse the seeds in cool, clean water using a colander with very small holes or a strainer. Drain them well and put them in a bowl.  Soaking the seeds initiates germination. By the end of the process, the seeds will have sprouted small roots.   Pour cold water, preferably filtered, into the bowl of seeds. Add about three times as much water as you have seeds. Cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap and place it on the counter to soak for about 10 hours, or overnight.Drain the water from the seeds and replace it with more cold, filtered water - again, about three times as much water as you have seeds. Let it soak for another 10 hours. Repeat the process one more time, for a total of three long soaks. By the end of the last soak, the seeds should have sprouted roots. This means they are ready to plant. Drain them and set them aside until you're ready to plant them.  Line the seed tray with paper towels, to prevent the wheatgrass roots from growing through the holes in the bottom of the tray. Spread an even one-inch layer of organic compost or potting soil in the seed tray.   If possible, use paper towels that have not been treated with chemicals or dyes. Recycled, chemical-free paper towels are available at health food stores. Use pre-moistened compost or potting soil free of pesticides or other chemicals. It's important to use organic soil to get the most benefit from your wheatgrass.  Spread the seeds in an even layer across the top of the compost or potting soil. Lightly press the seeds into the soil, but don't completely bury them.   It's fine if the seeds are touching each other, but make sure there's not a pile of seeds in one area. Each seed needs a little room to grow. Water the tray lightly, making sure each seed gets a sprinkle. Cover the tray with a few moistened sheets of newspaper to protect the seedlings.  It's important to make sure the seeds don't dry out in the first few days after you plant them. Keep them damp as they root themselves in the seed tray.Lift the newspaper and water the tray thoroughly in the morning so that the soil is wet, but not completely waterlogged. Use a spray bottle filled with water to lightly mist the soil in the evening before you go to bed, so the seedlings don't dry out overnight. Spray the newspaper, too, so it keeps them wet. On the fourth day after planting, remove the newspaper to prevent the seeds from sprouting under it. Continue watering the sprouted grass once a day.  Direct sun will damage the grass, so make sure it is always in a shady place in your home.  Once the shoots are mature, a second blade of grass will begin growing out of the first shoot. This is called "splitting" and means that the grass is ready for harvesting.At this point the grass should be about six inches tall. Grass is usually ready to harvest after 9 or 10 days of growth.  Use a scissors to harvest the grass by clipping it just above the root and collecting it in a bowl. The harvested grass is ready to be juiced.   Harvested wheatgrass keeps in the refrigerator for about a week, but it tastes best and provides the most health benefits when it's harvested right before you plan to juice it. Keep watering the wheatgrass to produce a second crop. Harvest that crop once it's mature. Sometimes a third crop comes up, but it's usually not as tender and sweet as the first one. Empty the seed tray and prepare it for another batch of seedlings.  It takes a lot of wheatgrass to make just a few shots of wheatgrass juice. If you plan to make wheatgrass a part of your daily diet, you'll need more than one tray of seedlings growing at a time.   Time the growing and harvesting cycle so that you have a new batch of seeds soaking while the previous batch is in the process of taking root. If you have two or three seeds at various stages in rotation, you should be able to produce enough wheatgrass to have a shot of juice every day. Wheatgrass is a beautiful bright green color, and adds a natural touch to your kitchen or sunroom, wherever you choose to grow it. Consider growing wheatgrass in a decorative container and surrounding your wheatgrass with other plants, so that you can enjoy the beauty of wheatgrass as well as its health benefits.  Since the wheatgrass was grown from organic seeds in organic soil or compost, it doesn't need a heavy washing. Give it a light rinse to wash away any debris or dust it may have collected from the air.  Special wheatgrass juicers are designed to make the most of this fibrous plant.   Avoid using regular juicers, since wheatgrass can clog them and cause them to break. You can use a blender if you don't have a juicer. Once the wheatgrass is completely blended, use a strainer to take out the solids.  You only need a few ounces of wheatgrass juice to feel the effects of its powerful mix of vitamins and minerals.  

source wheatgrass seeds.  prepare the seeds for soaking.  soak the seeds.  prepare the seed tray for planting.  plant the seeds.  keep the seeds moist.  keep the grass in partial sunlight.  wait for the wheatgrass to "split.",  cut the wheatgrass above the root.  start the process again.  rinse the wheatgrass.  place the wheatgrass in a juicer.  enjoy a shot of wheatgrass. 

 Instruct them to pick one out, without showing or telling you which card they chose, and to place the card back into the stack at random.; , You should have three columns of seven cards in front of you. Have your friend tell you which pile contains their card (without telling you which card it is, of course).  For example if the first pile contained their card, you could pick up the third pile first, then the first pile (containing the card) and then the second pile -- or the second pile, then the first, then the third. It is very important that the pile containing their card goes into the middle.  When done, you will have dealt the cards out a total of 3 times. , You can tell them it was magic... or you could explain the simple math that makes it work. Each time you deal out the cards you are dividing the placement of the card. By the 3rd time you have gotten the card into the middle of the pile. Thus you are able to tell where their card will be every time. The formula is Y=(X + 1)/2, where X is the number of cards and Y is the placement of the card in the pile after the 3rd deal. In this case, since X is 21, Y = 22/2 = 11.  

hand your friend a stack of twenty one playing cards.  deal the cards out in three columns, working row-by-row (1st column-2nd column-3rd column, 1-2-3, 1-2-3, etc).  gather the three columns into one stack of cards again, being sure to put the pile that holds their card in the middle of the three piles.  repeat the past two steps two more times.  if you have done the card trick correctly their card will be the 11th card in the pile of cards.  ,  your amazed friend may ask you how you did this. 

  Find suitable card for making your own cards. This might be new or recycled card, whichever works best. The size is up to you but be guided by the images you'll be adding from the old cards.       Fold into a card shape.       Choose the images you like the most from old Christmas cards. Cut them to size. Usually one image per card is sufficient but if there is a "set", decide how the images will fit and carefully arrange them. In some cases, drawing border boxes might help.       Use glue suited for paper and attach the images. Allow to dry completely.       Using a marker, pens, pencils or paint, add a message of greetings to the front and perhaps one inside the card.       Make as many as you'd like, then put them away for next year's holiday season. Repeat each year for a great tradition.   As above, find suitable card for making a card from. Fold into the card shape.       Gather the Christmas cards. Identify which motifs will go best with other motifs to create the collage. The collage can be eclectic, matching or even form a new image from the many images, depending how much time you wish to spend on it. Be conscious of the size of the card and cut the motifs to size.       Using glue suitable for paper, attach the collage pieces and form the collage on each card. Repeat as often as needed for the amount of cards you'd like to make.

 Silver makes a really lovely bell-like ringing sound when it is tapped on, particularly when it is tapped on with another form of metal. If you want to try this out before tapping on your questionable silver, find a United States quarter made before 1965. These were made of 90% silver while US quarters made later than 1964 are made of a copper-nickel alloy. The older quarter will give a high-pitched, clear ringing tone, while the newer quarters will give a dull thump of a sound., If it makes a sound like a bell ringing, you have a real silver coin in your hand. If it's dull, the silver is, most likely, mixed with other metals.  

try the ring test with any coin.  drop your own coin on a flat surface from about six inches above it. 

 Kids learn how to play by themselves when they examine how toys work. You can teach a child with autism how to play independently by teaching them basic play skills. Start small, with one-step toy manipulation. For example, teach the kid how to bang a toy hammer or drum or brush a doll's hair. Once they've learned basic play, you can teach two-step toy manipulation, like:"Feeding" the doll or putting it to bed Pressing buttons on a phone or musical toy Placing a spoon into a bowl and stirring with the spoon  , Children with autism might feel overwhelmed if they're immediately exposed to other kids during play time. Other kids can be unpredictable which can make it harder to teach play skills. Start by playing next to the kid with autism. For example, get out a couple of coloring books and sets of crayons. Begin coloring and the child with autism can begin coloring when they feel comfortable.Follow the kid's lead when it comes to playing. Some kids with autism might like having someone sit near them as they play. You may be able to directly play games or engage in cooperative play. You should also model a playful expression. Sing, laugh, smile, clap, and make funny voices when teaching play skills.  Once the child with autism has become comfortable playing around adults, expose them to a play group or other kids in a playful space. This will let the kid with autism become familiar with other kids. Try to choose kids who will cooperate and play easily. If the child with autism has motor delays, try to get them to play with slightly younger kids. This way, they'll easily be able to physically interact when they play.Set out motivating toys like balls, blocks, beads or puzzles for the kids to interact with. If the child with autism show signs that they don't want to play near the kids (showing signs of aggression like hitting or biting), don't force the play time. Work on letting the child become more comfortable by playing around adults.  While you can encourage a child with autism to play by instructing them, it's better to use small physical prompts. For example, instead of saying, "Put the puzzle together," show the child how the pieces connect. The kid can continue putting together the puzzle on their own. Cut back on the number of cues or prompts you use to get the child to play.Limit the number of verbal prompts you give. This will prevent the child from relying on it and will help them play more independently.  Kids with autism have different preferences when it comes to personal space. If the kids are far apart when they play, you might need to scoot them a little closer together. As you do this, you should encourage the kids. For example, say, "Good job playing together!" and give them a reward (like a sticker or treat).Consider setting out small squares of carpet or place mats with activities to encourage the kids to play near each other. Pay attention to how both kids are interacting. If one is struggling with the play time, you may need to move them apart a little and offer more encouragement.  

teach solitary play skills.  play next to the kid.  let kids play next to each other.  give physical cues to play.  monitor and encourage the kids.

 While obvious it must be stated again: candy is not good for you or your teeth. High in sugar, it's also sticky so it seals that sugar directly to your teeth, and your saliva turns those sugars to acids. Add in the fact it has no healthy benefits whatsoever and it’s easy to see why candy should be cut from your diet., This is particularly true for children and teenagers, whose enamel is not yet mature and therefore even more susceptible to the erosion caused by the acid content of vinegar. Regardless of age, after eating foods containing vinegar it’s a great idea to wash your mouth out afterwards.Also look to avoid vinegar in places you might not consider right away, such as potato chips, sauces (especially hot sauces), and pickles. Pickles may be the worst offenders as they contain vinegar AND sugar.  Grapefruit and lemons are the worst offenders among fresh citrus fruits due to their higher acid content. Perhaps even worse, however, are dried fruits. Not only are they high in sugars but their fibrous biology causes them to stick to teeth, wedging that sugar and acid into the cracks, crevices, and porous surfaces of teeth.   Don’t forget that tomatoes are a fruit. They also have a high acid content and can damage enamel both raw and as a sauce. Your best bet is to eat them as part of a meal so that you can enjoy their flavor and nutrients while cutting down on their acidity levels. Some citrus fruit each day shouldn't be a problem — these fruits, after all, have a great many benefits. Just be conscious of how much you are eating and try to notice any affects on your teeth.  Saliva breaks down carbs while you chew, turning them into enamel-eroding acid. Even healthy carbs like brown rice, whole-grains, and sweet potatoes are flagrant perpetrators. White carbohydrates are even worse — they are the most incriminated factors that produce cavities. Carbohydrates also tend to get stuck in teeth and continue to wear down enamel all day long, developing aggressive bacterial sites.  For example, eat something that counterbalances the acidity of fruit, such as nuts, at the time of eating the fruit. This will turn enamel-wearing acids into friendly bases in your mouth, sparing your teeth the wear-and-tear.  Most snack foods are carbohydrates in one form or another, contain sugar, and some of them are also acidic due to the presence of vinegar or other additives. So in addition to being, basically, devoid of nutritional value they also wear out the enamel on your teeth.  If you enjoy nibbling on food all day long, you may be endangering your teeth. The best solution is to ensure that the foods that you consume are either low in acidity or are combined with foods able to counteract the acidity and reduce your need for the acidic food.   For example, consuming nuts or cheese with fruit may be one way to reduce the effects of acid wear. Nuts and dairy foods are considered helpful balancers to acidic foods.  

don’t eat candy.  pass up vinegar-based salad dressings.  rinse after eating fruit.  reduce carbohydrates.  practice balanced eating patterns.  stay away from processed snack foods.  avoid grazing through the day. 

 Think of doing a crunching motion, bringing your ribs down toward your hips.   Note that although the Ab Lounge 2 directions instruct you to do an abdominal crunch, the resulting jackknife motion--as your hips drop and your legs and upper body come up--happens at your hip joint, not the lumbar spine. Your rectus abdominis muscle doesn't perform hip flexion; your hip flexors do.  Although your rectus abdominis muscle doesn't perform the primary motion during this exercise, it does work to stabilize your lumbar spine against the pull from your hip flexors.  

squeeze your rectus abdominis muscle that runs down the front of your abdomen from ribs to pelvis.  relax back to the starting position and repeat. 

 Black-oil sunflower seeds are best, as they have a high meat-to-shell ratio and fat content and are thin-shelled enough for small birds to crack open. Striped sunflower seeds are larger and have thicker seed coats and proportionately less meat per seed.  Add other seeds to your feeders, according to the types of birds in your area. Most tree-dwelling birds are attracted to sunflower seeds, but certain varieties prefer other types of food.Jays like sunflower seeds, suet, corn, millet, and milo. Woodpeckers like sunflower seeds and suet. Doves and other ground-feeding birds are attracted to white millet or red milo.  Commercial mixes are often a blend of sunflower seeds and cheaper, “filler” seeds like oats, wheat, flax, or buckwheat seeds. Birds will pick out the sunflower seeds, and leave the rest to spoil. It is usually cheaper and more effective to mix your own feed, because there is less waste. Less waste seed also makes your feeders easier to clean.   For a simple home-made bird feed, purchase 25 pounds of black-oil sunflower seed, 10 pounds of cracked corn, and 10-pounds of white proso millet. Pour the seed into a clean metal trash can, and blend the mixture with a broom or rake handle., Keep seed in a cool, dry place, in clean metal trash can and secure the lid to keep rodents out. Check your seed for mold on a regular basis, and dispose of any contaminated food. Try not to buy too much seed at one time, to avoid expensive waste. 

try sunflower seeds.this seed attracts the greatest variety of birds in most north american regions.  feed a variety of foods for different birds.  mix your own bird food.  find a good place to store your bird food. 

 Don’t create long, drawn-out sentences. Although some variation in sentence length keeps your writing interesting, sentences that are too long can confuse the reader.   Over long sentences keep the reader on edge, delaying meaning and creating more points than can be comprehended in one go. Instead, keep sentences shorter. Only have one or two main ideas in each sentence. For example an overly long sentence could read: "Learning to write better sentences can be a good way to make your writing crisper and snappier, without losing the central meaning of your sentence, and still including all the necessary details that support your thought."; , Look at the long sentence above. How could it be rewritten into shorter, better sentences?   It has at least 3 main points, so you can divide it that way. This could be a possible way to break that sentence up well. “Learning to write better sentences can be a good way to make your writing crisper and snappier. Additionally, you can do this without losing the central meaning of your sentence. All necessary details can still be included.” You’ll need to add in transition words in places, such as “additionally,” to help the shorter sentences connect. Nonetheless, the shorter sentences help your reader grasp your meaning more easily.  Use a single word in place of 2- and 3-word phrases if possible.   Like varying sentence length, varying word choice makes writing more interesting; however, choosing to use longer phrases makes the writing lengthier. Look at this example: “It was not the same as eating pie with her.” If you change the negative to a positive, the sentence becomes shorter: “It was different than eating pie with her.” While 2 words might not seem like that much, they do add up over a long piece of writing.  

create simpler sentences.  make long sentences shorter.  use single words instead of 2-and 3-word phrases. 

 Make sure that your legs are positioned wider than your hips to give you better purchase. Raise your right arm and hold up the weight, opening up to form a "T" with your body. Repeat this move on your left side. This combination constitutes one repetition. You'll need to do between 10 and 20 repetitions.   For beginners, just raise your arm as high as you can. As you get stronger, you can increase the range of your lifting.  Hold two five to 10 pound weights in each hand and raise your arms up. Keep your palms turned down and hold your elbows firmly against your body. Now, take a breath and lower the weights to about one inch from your chest, breathe out, and raise them again. Repeat the procedure up to forty times.  Draw a "C" with each arm, bringing your arms toward your hips. Return your arms to their original positions, and then repeat the process up to 20 times.  Get down on your hands and knees, and with your hands on the weights placed just a little wider than your shoulders, lift your body up so that you're balanced on your toes. Carefully lower your chest toward the floor while stabilizing yourself with your core muscles. Then raise yourself back into your original position. Repeat this up to 15 times.   If this is too difficult, balance on your knees instead of your toes.

 When creating the code, instead of putting the letters in alphabetical order in the grid, try randomly assigning letters to boxes. This way, people who are familiar with pigpen code will not be able to immediately guess which symbol relates to which letter.   The more you randomize your code, the more difficult it will be for others to figure it out. If you are using this code to write to your friends, make sure that they have a copy of your cipher.  If you use dots, others may recognize your code as a pigpen code immediately. Try replacing the dots with other symbols, such as 0, X, *, or +. Furthermore, if you really want to confuse people, use multiple symbols in coding your grids.  If you are using a single grid and X to form your code, you can make the code even more difficult by writing three letters instead of two in each space. While writing in this method, each symbol will consist of zero, one or two dots. Zero is the left letter, one is the middle and two is the right one.   In this version, you will have extra spaces. You can fill them with numbers, punctuation (!, ?, &) or leave them blank.  The tic-tac-toe cipher is a type of pigpen cipher used for numbers. Draw a crosshatch grid and fill each space with a number. You don’t need to add dots. Simply use the shape formed by the surrounding lines of each number. Replace “0” with an X.For example, 101 would appear as _| X _|   

randomize the order of your letters.  replace dots with other symbols.  write three letters instead of two letters in the spaces.  make your numbers into ciphers. 

 Place the other half back in the refrigerator (either make pineapple salad or pineapple juice from it, or you can make another round of pineapple sorbet bowl for a large party).; ,   Run a knife down the middle of the flesh. Don't cut through the pineapple peel. Score around the edge of the soft flesh with the knife, to cut into it. Leave the hard flesh sides intact. Run cuts across the line you made down the center of the pineapple. This will form cubes. The flesh is now ready to be scooped out.  Use a large metallic spoon to remove the flesh. Scrape out any leftover soft flesh, leaving the hard flesh intact to strengthen the peel sides.  In the meantime, make the pineapple sorbet (see next). , Blend or process until smooth. , Freeze for 1-2 hours.  Turn into sorbet by hand or by machine, as follows:   Stir the frozen sorbet mixture to get it out of the container (use a metallic spoon).  Following the instructions for the appliance, turn into sorbet.  It is recommended that it be covered with a large freezer bag to prevent icicles forming. ,,, Freeze for 5 hours.  Remove the pineapple shell with sorbet contents and place on the table. Provide a scoop or two––that way, guests can scoop out the amount of sorbet they'd like to eat.  

cut a large pineapple in half.  cut the pineapple flesh.  scoop out the cubes of pineapple and put into a bowl.  place the pineapple shell in the freezer to harden.  drop the pineapple cubes into the blender or food processor.  ,  add the sugar, lemon juice and water.  pour the sorbet mixture into a container suitable for freezing, or on a parchment covered baking sheet/tray with raised edges.  ,  place in the freezer.  remove from the freezer.  place the mixture into an ice cream maker.  scoop the finished product into the frozen pineapple shell and place back in the freezer until needed.  put the sorbet back into the blender or food processor.  ,  blend until smooth.  ,  spoon the sorbet into the frozen pineapple half.  ,  place back in the freezer; it is recommended that it be covered with a large freezer bag to prevent icicles forming.  done. 

 Blow dry your hair with a diffuser to pump up the volume, paying extra attention to your roots.In addition to or instead of blow drying, you can tease your roots. Back-comb dry hair in one- to two-inch sections with a fine-toothed comb.Try using volumizer spray on damp hair before blowdrying. Use hairspray with hold on each sectioned of teased hair as you go.; , Use a heat protectant spray first to protect your locks. Straighten your hair with a flattening iron, or crimp it with a crimping iron. Alternately, add large curls to the ends only., Use a pick to create a part, and flip your hair over to one side. Wet a brush or comb with water or styling product. Place the brush at the top middle of your forehead near your hairline. Swoop the brush upwards and towards the side opposite the part. Seal the look with hairspray.Repeat the brush or comb swoop multiple times, if needed, to achieve the look you want before applying hairspray. If desired, repeat the swoop on the hair below the part to the side of your face. Move the brush horizontally to put a bit of wave there. Use your fingers to comb through your locks and flip them to the side throughout the day like Cher from the movie Clueless. If you don’t use a firm hold hairspray, you can even tousle the flip from one side to another!  

add volume to your roots.  choose your texture.  part your hair to one side. 

 If you're at a work event, ask someone his opinion on a recent work situation. For example, if the company's been considering a merger, ask him what he thinks of it.Try not to share your own opinion on topics before you know more about the other person's perspective. If he doesn't share your opinion on a topic, move on to another topic. Asking for advice about small topics is a good ice-breaker. An example might be, "I'm not sure about this tie - do you think it's appropriate?"; , There's always something to comment on, whether you're outside or inside, at a large event or a small one. If there's been a speaker, a presentation, or entertainment, say something about it in a way that encourages response.You can make a comment about the environment anywhere. If you're on an elevator with someone, notice if there are ads posted on the wall, or how quickly the elevator is moving. If you're in a restaurant, notice something about the decor. Make a comparison between this event and others like it. For example, "This is way better than the holiday party last year!"  , This works best if you can work it into a current event or something happening at the event. For example, "I recently read a book where an old woman left his fortune to a man she barely knew. What would you do if someone left her fortune to you?"  Open-ended questions invite more conversation than questions with a clear answer. The hypothetical question is only one example of an open-ended question. This is also a good conversation starter for a group of people. If there's one person you're trying to get to know, ask the person the question directly, even as you invite the whole group to answer.  People are more likely to respond to positive comments, compliments, and praise. Starting a conversation with someone you don't know is a good chance to practice the old adage, "If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all."Be modest and humble as you talk. No one likes a know-it-all. Find something positive to mention about any topic. If you hate 95% of the topic, seek out the 5% for comments.  People usually like to be asked about their pets, children, or hobbies. See if he has pictures, and ask to see them. You might find you have things in common that spark more conversation.  Following a compliment with a question can be a good strategy. For example, "I really love that jacket - where did you get it?" Invite the person to share an opinion with you. For example, "That presentation was really great - didn't you think so?"  

ask for opinion or advice.  comment on the event.  ask a hypothetical question.  avoid critical comments.  ask friendly questions. 

 They might have horizontal stripes and come just below the knee. Wear these with tennis shoes and gym shorts, a short knit skirt or jean shorts.   Aim to get inspiration from 70s-era movies, like Dazed and Confused, where the actresses combined tight shorts with knee high sports socks.; , Add a tunic or hoodie and a pair of low sneakers.   Consider incorporating a scarf that matches the socks. You can also wear them with leather or rain boots.  Add on a pair of low heels or booties. This style works well with a button up shirt or sweater.  These can look like different animals, or spell a message down the side of the sock. Pair with knit or jean shorts and sneakers.  The bottom can go over the tops of booties and the top can be scrunched up or down as much as you desire. Pair them with tights for a ballet-style look or a knit dress.  Add in denim shorts, a skater skirt and a sweater or plaid button down shirt.  Black is slimming and easy to match with outfits. Pair them with either a short black dress or a short black skirt, so that there are a few inches of bare skin between the black clothing.   These socks can be worn with ballet flats, ankle boots or knee-high boots in a black color.  You can experiment with different colors than the boots to highlight your socks.  They serve as a great way to stay warm, but they can also be pulled up and scrunched down between the top of the boots and the top of the knee for a leg-warmer look.   Try a pair with ruffles or frills for a girl twist.  This is best done with patterned sweater socks.  A short frilly dress can look girlier by combining it with a pair of knit socks and ballet shoes.  Then, add a pair of short shorts, a skirt or dress. Play with different colors and layers as well as boots, booties and ballet flats. , Layer with a pair of leather boots and a cardigan, blazer or leather jacket., You will remain warm, but can play with the peekaboo look of contrasting layers and short skirts.  

find socks that have a retro sports looks.  layer a pair of contrasting sweater socks or patterned socks over a pair of tight yoga pants for a comfortable, yet sporty look.  try a prep school look by wearing a short plaid skirt with knee-highs.  send a message by purchasing a pair of novelty socks.  wear leg warmers in place of traditional knee-high socks.  pair your knee-highs with a pair of combat boots for a casual look.  start with a pair of over-the-knee-black knit socks.  go for a chunky fall look by combining a short skirt, a long sweater, a pair of thick over-the-knee socks and knee-high boots.  buy a pair of thick sweater knee-high socks to go under boots.  fold sweater knee-highs down over tight boots.  mix textures and colors by combining a solid color dress with a solid, but different-colored pair of socks in a contrasting color.  put on a pair of tights and layer them with a pair of contrasting knee-high socks.  channel a high fashion look by pairing a patterned romper or high-waisted shorts with a pair of solid colored knee-highs.  ,  put a pair of thick, oversized knee-highs over skinny jeans.  style any knee-high look for winter by wearing a coat that comes to the knees. 

 You are relying on the warm air to dry your pillow by evening.; , Inspect its condition. If it appears ready for another year's use, then prepare it for cleaning.  Use a gentle soap that is suitable for hand-washing.  You can gently push it but do not knead or wring. , Do not wring the pillow. Instead, use a bath sheet to wrap around the pillow and soak up as much excess water as possible. It is best if you do this in the bath or container (drained of water). Once the water has been absorbed as much as possible, remove the pillow to a drying space.  Lay the pillow over a sweater drying device or over a chair back. Keep out of direct sunlight and let the warm air dry it.  Restore pillow cover, pillowcase and return to the bed.  

do this on a warm day, first thing in the morning.  remove all covers from the pillow.  fill a bathtub or other container large enough to fit the pillow with warm, soapy water.  sponge clean the pillow.  rinse thoroughly.  ,  remove the excess water.  dry.  pat back into shape gently once dried. 

 This button necklace will be strung on a wire, making it more durable than those that use thread. To shape the wire into loops, you'll need crimp beads and jewelry pliers, which you might not have but can be purchased from your local craft store. Including these items, you'll also need:   Buttons Chain Clasp Crimp beads (2) Jewelry pliers Jump rings (2) Tiger-tail wire Wooden beads (4)  , Your wire is where you'll be stringing your buttons and beads to create the pattern of your necklace. You will attach this length of wire to your chain to complete the neck chain, so you'll only need about six to eight inches (15 - 20 cm), plus four inches (10 cm) for connecting wire to chain with loops.  Thread one end of your wire through your crimp bead and follow it with a jump ring. Now you can loop your wire around and bring it back through the way it came, keeping the loop on the outside of the crimp bead. Then use your jewelry pliers to crimp the crimp bead and fix the loop and jump ring into place.   Your loop should be about ¼ to ½ inch (½ - 1¼ cm) in size.  These wooden beads will give a nostalgic aesthetic to your necklace while helping keep your buttons together. The beads you string first onto your wire will form the outside of your pattern closest to your crimp bead.   Be careful that your wooden beads are not so large that they bypass the jump ring.  To create a uniform appearance, you may want to stick with buttons that are roughly the same size.Adding a variety of colors can give your necklace a lively appearance. String your buttons flat-wise one after another until you have about two inches (5 cm) of free wire remaining.To complete the symmetry of your necklace, you should end with two wooden beads, same as the beginning of your pattern.  Just as you did with your starting loop, first string a crimp bead and then follow it with a jump ring. Then bring around the end of your wire to feed back through the crimp bead and use your jewelry pliers to crimp fasten the loop.   Your second loop should mirror your first, and should be about ¼ to ½ inch (½ - 1¼ cm) in size.  Use the clasp of your chain to connect the jump ring at one end and then open the other jump ring with your jewelry pliers. Attach the loose end of your chain to the jump ring and bend it back closed with the pliers to complete the chain. Slip the finished necklace over your head or unclasp it and re-clasp it around your neck.   If you find that your necklace is a little on the long side, you can remove a few links of the chain with your jewelry pliers. 

assemble your necklace crafting tools.  cut your wire.  crimp a jump ring onto a loop at one end.  string larger, wooden beads onto your wire.  thread your buttons onto the line.  loop a crimp bead and jump ring on your wire and crimp.  add your chain to connect your jump rings.  finished.  

 Because many of the symptoms associated with LCM occur in many other illnesses, it is important to see a doctor so that they can identify your specific condition. Even if it’s not LCM, the combination of so many symptoms indicates that you need some sort of medical treatment. Be sure to tell the doctor about any exposure to mice, areas contaminated with mouse droppings, pets such as hamsters, or any work you did with laboratory mice.   Even if you seem to be recovering, see a doctor anyway. Sometimes people infected with LCM seem to recover before relapsing into the second, more severe phase of the illness.Your doctor will prescribe a specific course of treatment based on your condition. Even with medical help, recovery may take several months;however, recovery outlook is excellent, as less than 1% of cases end in death.; , The symptoms of LCM can be caused by a number of different diseases and disorders. Let your doctor know about any problems you have been having with your health. The most common symptoms of LCM include:   Fever Malaise and fatigue Headaches Nausea and vomiting A lack of appetite Aches and pains in the chest, jaw, and testicles, There are several tests that can confirm or rule out the presence of LCM.   Your doctor may test your white blood cell count and platelet count.If the doctor finds these counts are low, you might have LCM. You might also get your blood tested for liver enzyme levels. These enzymes, if slightly elevated, could indicate LCM. Another test that can help determine if LCM is present is the spinal tap. This procedure involves inserting a needle into your spinal canal to collect cerebrospinal fluid. Examining the fluid, a doctor can look for a decrease in glucose levels that could indicate LCM.  Symptoms such as the above can be caused by many different disorders, not just LCM. If you have been exposed to mice, mouse droppings, or areas contaminated by mouse saliva, urine and stool, you may have particular reason to suspect LCM.  

see a doctor.  report your symptoms to your doctor.  get tested.it is important to get tested to ensure that you have lcm.  consider your exposure to mice. 

 This is absolutely essential. You can't just pick up a violin and play it straight away, it takes a substantial amount of time to learn and you will likely need several years experience before you can tackle complicated songs.; , You can learn songs by ear but it's better if you can read the actual notes.Note: Only treble clef is used in violin music.  Buy books of sheet music in music shops (make sure it's for violin though), or try the internet. Also try learning by ear.   If you're a beginner, try nursery rhymes. (You'll probably do this if you have proper lessons anyway.)       Although they aren't really songs as such, you can learn a lot from playing classical music. (Again, the kind of things you'll likely do in lessons, if you have them.)       Country music would be a good idea to play as violins are often used.       Same goes for pop; you will often hear some violins in amongst the guitar, bass and synthesizers.       You could try rock and metal, but usually these kind of genres' music focuses much more on guitars. However, if you really want to play rock/metal songs on violin and have had a good few years experience, consider learning a bit about guitars and guitar tabs; this will open the door to a world of online tabs which you should be able to adapt for violin with some knowledge and skill. 

learn to play the violin.  learn to read music.  look for songs to play.  have fun!  

 The movie he suggests you watch can be a big indicator if he wants to kiss you during the movie. A movie that he is very excited to watch might mean he wants to focus more on the movie than on kissing you. If he chooses a movie he does not seem excited about, he might have chosen it so he can kiss you during the movie.   If he has seen the movie before, he might want to kiss you more than pay attention to the movie. He might be hoping the movie sparks your interest in kissing him if he chooses a romantic movie.Keep in mind that the movie he chooses might not necessarily be an indicator if he wants to kiss you or not.; , If he suggests somewhere to sit, it might be an indicator of whether he wants to kiss you or not. Kissing might not be the first thing on his mind if he wants to sit right in the front or next to a group of people. He might be thinking about kissing you if he suggests you sit in the back or in an isolated corner.If you are hoping to kiss him, you can suggest sitting in the back if he doesn’t: “There are a lot of empty seats in the back. Let’s sit over there!”  , If he does not get food, he might be worried about it getting in the way of kissing you or making his breath smell bad. However, sharing food can spark physical contact and break barriers. Sharing food might lead to accidentally touching hands when reaching for the popcorn or breaking germ barriers when sharing a soda.Eating together can also make you become more comfortable around each other and make you both less nervous.  A guy might be interested in kissing you if he is being playful with you and giving you compliments. He will probably talk to you before the movie starts and might try to initiate conversation and flirty commentary during the movie too.   Whispering and getting close to your ear when he talks is a sign he might want to kiss.He might say something complimentary: “You look very pretty in your dress!” He might make funny comments about the previews or the movie to make you laugh: “Wow! That horror movie looks like a great movie to bring my baby sister to!”  , What he is looking at during the movie can be a sign if he is trying to kiss you. Looking at you during the movie, especially at your eyes or lips, it is a good sign he wants to kiss. Looking into your eyes a lot could mean he is about to kiss you.   Watch his facial expressions and see if he seems happy or nervous. This could mean he wants to kiss you.If he is giving you sideways glances and turning away quickly, he probably wants to kiss., Where he is sitting in his chair can be a sign if he wants to kiss you. If he is sitting as close to you as he can or is resting his legs and feet on yours, he might want to kiss. If he is completely leaned over toward the opposite direction as you, he probably does not want to kiss., If he is holding your hand, has his arm around you, or is resting his hand on your leg, he probably wants to kiss you. He might not be trying to kiss you if he keeps his hands to himself or is more focused on eating snacks than on you., It does not necessarily mean he wants to kiss if he is chewing gum or has a breath mint, but it might be a sign. This could show he is preparing himself to kiss you and wants it to go well., Some guys might be really scared to kiss you, even if they want to. If he seems nervous and is sweating a lot and looking down and away from you often, he might be too scared to kiss you. You can always scoot closer to him, hold his hand, or flirt with him if you want to make him feel less nervous. If you think he wants to kiss you but is too nervous, you can make the move if you want to kiss him.  

notice what movie he wants to see.  see where he wants to sit.  notice if he gets food to share.  watch how he talks to you before the movie.  look to see if he is making eye contact with you.  notice the distance he is sitting from you.  see what he does with his hands.  see if he is chewing gum or using mints.  help him if he is nervous. 

 The holes must fit your fingers in such a way that you can hold the ball without having to squeeze and you can let go without your fingers getting stuck. Because you will be imparting rotation on the ball in the final split seconds that your hand is in contact with it, the importance of grip cannot be overstated.   With the ball resting in the palm of your dominant hand, put your middle and ring finger all the way into the two holes that are side-by-side, and your thumb in the hole under them. The holes should be the size of the fingers and thumb, and you should be able to hold the ball easily in the palm of your hand. There shouldn't be tension in the web of your thumb, nor should it be slack.It should take very little pressure to hold the ball in your hand. If you could break an egg with that amount of pressure, it's too much.; , The characteristics of the core or interior weight block of the bowling ball play an important part in the ball's performance. While there are a number of different core alignments, there are two basic categories into which all balls fit. Determine which type you are using before you get started.Look over your bowling ball and see if it has just one "pin"--the spot on the exterior, usually of a different color, indicating the orientation of the core--or a single normal pin plus a second PSA indicator/mass bias pin. If there is only one pin, the ball should have a symmetric weight block. If you bisected the ball along the axis of the pin, you would discover that both sides are symmetric. This type of ball may be easier for a beginner to handle. A ball with an asymmetric weight block should possess two pins or a pin and an indicator. Just as the name indicates, these balls do not contain symmetric cores, and can contain any shape from that of a cube to something resembling the letter "L." It may prove slightly more difficult for a beginner to attain consistent performance with these bowling balls, but practice with a single ball can certainly change that.  There are two separate guidelines used to suggest the size of ball that should be used. One rule of thumb focuses on the sex of the bowler, and suggests that adult women should use a 10-14 pound ball, while adult men use a 14-16 pound ball.The alternate guideline states that a bowler should use a ball roughly 10% of their body weight, up to the 16 pound maximum size of the ball for those over 160 pounds in weight.It is important to use a ball of the appropriate weight in order to impart the necessary amount of spin. A strong individual using a smallish ball could easily impart too much torque and put the ball in the gutter. A weaker individual using too heavy a ball could struggle to impart enough spin in order to make the ball hook. The weight of the ball should be clearly marked on it.  The pocket is the space between two pins that you want to target with the ball. If you're right-handed, the pocket is the space between the number 1 pin (the foremost pin) and the number 3 pin (the pin just behind and to the right of number 1). If you're left-handed, your pocket is between the number 1 and number 2 pin (the pin just behind and to the left of number 1).  The style of grip that you use can determine the intensity of the ball's hook--in other words, at what angle the ball enters the pocket. Remember that the greater the angle, the better your scoring potential.   A "relaxed" grip is more likely to produce a straighter roll, and thus a minimal hook. In this grip, the hand is flexed back at the wrist, so that as you pass into the forward swing it is on top of the ball. For a "strong" grip, the hand bends forward, as if to cradle the ball between your palm and inner wrist. If seen from the side, the angle from your forearm to your thumb should appear to be 90 degrees. This grip can provide a greater amount of spin, and from that a greater hook. A "firm" grip is an intermediate form that results in a moderate hook. In this grip the wrist neither bends nor flexes, creating a continuous line from your forearm through your hand., As you face the lane, imagine its boards grouped into three sections: outside left (towards the left gutter), middle, and outside right (towards the right gutter). Keeping in mind the strength of your grip and the anticipated amount of hook it will produce, decide which board(s) your sliding forward foot should align with.   Relaxed grip: The ball should travel straight down the lane into the pocket, so if you're right-handed, your stance should be in the outside right, and lefties in the outside left. Firm grip: Your stance should be in the middle, so the ball curves moderately (either left or right) and enters your target pocket. Strong grip: You want to allow plenty of room for the ball's hook to curve around and enter the pocket. If you're right-handed, you should be on the outside left side; if you're left-handed, you should be on the outside right., One of the standard forms is referred to as the "Four Step Approach." For this approach, begin standing up straight with your feet directly under your body. Hold the ball from underneath with your bowling hand at about mid-chest height (higher for slower bowlers, lower for faster bowlers), and support the ball with your non-bowling hand. As you move through the four steps, keep your bowling arm's elbow as close to your hip as possible, bend your knees slightly, and keep your feet pointed towards the pins. Your shoulders should be squarely facing front. (The following directions are for right-handed bowlers; if you are left-handed, reverse the sides.)   Take one step forward with your right foot and simultaneously bring the ball forward to a position over that foot. Keep your non-bowling hand supporting the ball at this point. Move your left foot forward as you lower the ball close to a knee-level position and then further back behind you, making a half-circle. Your non-bowling hand will have released the ball at this point. Take another step forward with your right leg. At the same time you should be entering the highest point of your backswing with the ball. Bring the ball forward as you take your last step toward the line with your left leg. Your right leg should subtly pass sideways behind your left as you plant your left leg and release the ball. Lower your hips and shift your weight slightly back, bending your torso forward at a 15-degree angle., You will not impart spin by bending or twisting your wrist or arm at this point.Instead, it is through proper delivery and release of the ball that you will impart the spin that results in a "hook."  , Maintain a constant grip as your hand moves into the forward swing, passing the heel of your sliding shoe (the left foot for right-handed bowlers), and then release the ball as it passes the laces. This is the optimum point for momentum to carry the ball onto the lane., The spin comes from your fingers as they release the ball, rather than the wrist. Releasing the thumb first lets the ball roll off the hand, which is where it gets the torque it needs for spin., A small, 15-degree rotation (counterclockwise for right-handed bowlers and clockwise for left-handed) helps add spin.Imagine positioning your hand as if coming into a handshake.  Continue to move your arm upward and forward toward the pocket as you release the ball (and after).  You must first work on consistency. The ability to put all the elements together and repeat them are the keys to success. In the process, think about things like your stance position or the type of grip that you employ.   Also work on your timing with the Four Step Approach: you want to make sure that your foot and the ball arrive at the foul line at the same time. Try recording yourself bowling to get a better sense of how good your timing is.  

find a ball with the right grip for you.  identify the type of ball you are using.  select a ball of the appropriate weight.  determine where the pocket is.  grip the bowling ball.  decide where your stance should be based on the combination of pocket position and grip.  think about your approach before you begin.  keep your arm and wrist straight during the backswing.  release the ball as your arm moves between the laces and toe of your forward-sliding shoe.  make sure your thumb is the first finger out of the ball.  rotate your hand just slightly from the wrist at the moment of release.  follow through with the swing.  adjust based on results. 

 In order to gain your younger sibling's respect, it’s important that they see you are a fair person. If you’re in a situation where you’re in charge, don’t take advantage of your power by being unfair. This could include controlling the TV programming, hogging the computer or game console, or taking what’s not yours.   Try to share with your younger siblings so they come to appreciate when you have to care for them. If you have more than one sibling you have to look after, make sure to be equally fair to all of them.  Younger siblings can be incredibly annoying and stubborn at times, but it’s important to keep your cool. Allowing them small, inconsequential victories will boost their self esteem and make them feel better. As a result, you'll also avoid unnecessary conflict. Don’t fight with your siblings. Be the authority and example they can aspire to be like.   A younger sibling may not always accept your authority.However, you can condition them over time as long as you maintain your maturity. Letting your sibling win in a videogame is an easy way to make them feel good., Your younger sibling will trust you the more that they see you can solve problems when your parents are away. They will come to you for guidance if they need something and the more you’re able to act like a parent, the more they’ll respect and look up to you.   Clean spills or messes before your parents come home. Helping younger siblings with homework will also show them how knowledgeable you are.  You could confuse a younger sibling if your rules are different than when your parents are around. There should be house rules that are established that never change or deviate.Be firm when you reprimand a sibling for breaking the rules. They need to know they did something wrong so they don't do it in the future.  One way to build distrust is to brag about how much later you can stay up, or the types of movies or music you’re allowed to listen to. This will only make a younger sibling feel resentment towards you.   Avoid talking about the special things you're allowed to do. Instead, enjoy that you’re able to do them.  

be fair even if it’s not in your favor.  take the high road and maintain maturity.  try to solve problems when they arise.  enforce house rules about privileges.  don’t flaunt your privileges in front of your sibling. 

 When a cat enters kill mode, a flimsy cage won’t stop it. While there are steps to follow that will reduce the likelihood of your cat becoming unnecessarily aggressive, it is still worthwhile to have a cage for your guinea pigs that guarantees their safety from demise by tooth and claw.   Recognize that your cat is also capable of seriously harming your guinea pig without intending to do so.As such, your guinea pig needs an area where they are completely safe, even if only from some overzealous rough-housing.; , If possible, you’ll want to keep your guinea pigs in a safe room where your cats are not regularly allowed. If you do not have sufficient space to allow this arrangement, choose a location for the cage that will prevent your cats from hanging out on or around the guinea pig enclosure.Always keep all cat toys and guinea pig toys separated in your house. If you have a guinea pig area, keep all of their worldly possessions in that area, and do not store or allow any cat stuff in that area. Disallow your cat from sitting beside or resting on top of your guinea pig’s enclosure at any time.  Especially if one arrives after you’ve already had the other for a while, allow the new arrival to acclimate to your home before introducing them to each other. They will already be able to smell one another’s presence. Let the suspense build a bit.   Wait at least a week before introducing a cat and a guinea pig. Technically, you just need to make sure they are not able to touch one another or make eye contact. To be safe, don’t allow them to see one another at all., Before actually introducing your pets, acclimate your cat to the guinea pig’s scent. There are several ways to do this. The intent is to associate things your cat likes, such as food, with the guinea pig. This may seem counterintuitive, but the cat will not think of the guinea pig as food – instead, it will think the guinea pig smell indicates that other (and more appropriate) food is nearby.Place the cat’s food just outside the door of the room in which your guinea pig lives. If your cat gets amped up outside the guinea pig’s room, remove them. Do so in a jovial, relaxed manner – you don’t want to indicate punishment, you just want to distract the cat from its overzealousness.Place a wash cloth that you rubbed the guinea pig with near the cat’s food bowl. Once your cat is entirely comfortable with the wash cloth (no longer nervously or excitedly sniffing it from time to time), use the washcloth to stroke the cat as well. Use the same cloth to go back and forth between your pets, stroking each right after you stroked the other. As you do so, be relaxed and high spirited. Send the vibe to each pet that everything is awesome!  

house your guinea pigs in a solid enclosure.  establish specific areas where each pet is allowed to be.  allow both pets to become comfortable in their home environments independently.  emphasize the other pet’s presence. 

 Though you are tidying up after your cockatiel once a day, you should do a major cleaning of the cage once a week. Place your bird in a cage in a different room so they are not affected by any fumes from cleaning supplies., If your cockatiel habitat has shields that extend beyond the edge of the cage, the shields will catch feces and food debris. Every couple of days, you should take a hot rag to wipe down the mess on the shields.You may need to wipe them down more often if your cockatiel creates a lot of mess on the shields.  After removing and cleaning all the accessories, you should start cleaning the cage. Remove the drop tray. Throw away any product used in the bedding tray for droppings. Then, wash the drop tray with hot water or a vinegar solution., Before you can disinfect the cage, you need remove any food, droppings, and seeds from the bars. Disinfectants won’t work if there is organic material on the bars. Use a commercial bird-safe cleanser or a vinegar solution.If the build up is caked on and hard to remove, let it soak in hot water for awhile before cleaning it.  Scrub the bars using a brush and hot water or vinegar solution. Remove all food, seeds, and feces that are stuck on the bars of the cage. Rinse off any cleanser before returning your bird to their cage., Some cockatiel enclosures are difficult to clean because they are deep and contain hard to reach places. To clean those edges, use a high-powered hose, like a pressure washer or steam washer.You can also try a garden hose.  Wash the seed skirt or cage apron with hot soapy water. You should also clean the area of floor beneath the cage. Use hot soapy water and a bird-safe disinfectant., Before placing your cockatiel back inside the cage, make sure it is completely dry. You can dry it with a towel, or you can let it air dry. If the weather permits, let the cage dry in the sun because sunlight can help disinfect it., When you reassemble the cage, put the toys in different areas or change out the toys. This can help keep your cockatiel from getting bored or developing bad habits, like preening. 

clean the cage once each week.  clean the shield every few days.  remove the drop tray.  remove organic material from the cage.  scrub the bars on the cage.  spray difficult to clean enclosures with a hose.  clean the area beneath the cage.  let the cage dry.  place toys in different locations in the cage. 

 This might be a weeknight or a weekend, depending on your work schedule or preferences. The weekend may have the added benefit of being able to sleep in the next day, depending on your lifestyle.   Set the date aside so that it takes on significance for both of you. Ring it on the calendar. This will signify that the date is all systems go.; , Decide what you'll have for dinner, whether you'll watch a movie together, play a game or perhaps go skinny-dipping in your pool. Choose something fun that brings you together. You can also plan for romance in the bedroom later, with satin sheets, rose petals and champagne.   Consider whether or not it's worth getting a babysitter. This will depend on the size of your home, your budget and how you feel about having another person around on date night, but it might be a solution if you're concerned about interruptions during the date. Explain to the babysitter that you're having a date night at home and that it isn't to be interrupted apart from emergencies. Do you have a special area in the garden, such as a gazebo, a studio or similar, where you could go for a special evening outside? If the weather is good, spending the date night outside can be a great way to escape the kids and you can use apps on your cellphone to act as monitors on the kids, if you're worried.  This includes the groceries, scented candles, rose petals, a DVD/new game, new clothes/lingerie and so forth. This is part of the build-up for the evening, so indulge.   Make a list together and divide off who gets what and by when.  Try to choose recipes that can be baked or made ahead and simply heated up. It's not a lot of fun cooking intensely on date night, unless that's the very activity both of you love.   Another alternative is to order in your favorite take-out, no expenses spared. If your favorite restaurant delivers, order ahead of time (including any special requests), to ensure that a three-course meal will be dropped off at your door, ready to enjoy.  This will help you to feel less inclined to spend the day before your date night cleaning and wearing yourself out. Of course, there will still be kid's messes to clear up but they can help in many cases, or you can ask them to play in rooms where you can just shut the door.  On the day of date night, set up all the things in readiness for the date that can be set up, such as setting a romantic table, strewing cushions and throw rugs in the gazebo, placing candles out, and so forth. If your children are curious, tell them it's something special for mom and dad later. If they're likely to mess it up because they're too young to know any better, hold off until later.   Consider making the most of what the kids leave behind. For example, if they've built a fort, crawl inside and watch a DVD in there together.  Get feeding, bathing and bedtime stories sorted nice and early. This is where a babysitter may come in handy, even if she or he does this part, then leaves, as it gives you the space and time to set up your date night. (If your children tend to go to bed late, a babysitter may well be a very good investment.)  , Dress up and discard your at-home clothes. You can keep it comfortable by opting for formal casual rather than opulent evening wear but that's entirely up to you.  Turn on monitors if needed, otherwise, simply begin the date as if you were really doing something special. Have a lovely meal together, by candlelight or moonlight. Snuggle up somewhere and watch a movie, stargaze, simply talk or make out under the stars. Take a dip in the pool or hot tub. Have some nice wine or champagne, accompanied by delicious chocolate truffles. Dance to your favorite songs. Look for night birds. Have a wine, cheese or chocolate tasting session. Give each other a massage. Tell one another what you mean to each other. And so forth.   Play some romantic music in the background. Select the playlist well in advance and let it play uninterrupted.  Keep the dream going just a little longer, until little people are jumping up and down on your bed, demanding full attention again.  

decide on a suitable night for the in-home date.  plan for the date night.  shop ahead of time for the things you need.  make as much of the meal ahead of time as possible.  clean the house the day before.  prepare for the date night.  get the kids to bed as early as is reasonable.  dress for date night.  begin date night when the kids are safely tucked up.  sleep in if you can. 

 If you are cooking or cleaning the house, get your dog to tag along with you. If you are lounging on the couch watching TV, have your dog jump on up and snuggle with you. You can even talk to your dog during these moments as that will help you both to bond too., You can tailor your outdoor experience depending on your dog's breed. A small dog can participate in a hike if carried in an open pack whereas a large dog can probably trot alongside you. Dogs enjoy the outdoors because there are so many new smells and sensations. Paying attention to what your dog finds fascinating will also help you to view the same old path in a new light.Keep safety in mind when venturing outside with your dog. Make sure to apply repellent to your dog's fur if you are hiking somewhere with ticks or other pests. Offer water frequently to your dog and watch out for overheating or dehydration, often signaled by a slight shaking or excessive panting. To keep your dog interested in the outdoors feel free to try out new places. Don't get stuck in a routine that may be boring to you both.  Try to discover what types of play your dog enjoys the most. Some like to play fetch whereas others prefer hide and seek. Be creative and mix up your play time to experiment with new activities. Just be careful that your play does not bring out feelings of aggression within your dog, as tug of war can sometimes do.When you are playing and bonding with your dog, make a point to put your cell phone away. To keep your play sessions fresh you may want to rotate out toys every week or so. There are even subscription services online that, for a fee, will send you fresh toys at set intervals. To find a service like this search online for "pet toy delivery."  , Hit your favorite dog friendly restaurant or café. Go to a festival or public park with your dog in tow. Take a walk in your local pet-friendly outdoor shopping area. Try to incorporate your dog into your regular social activities. You will find that it is much easier than you think.With all of this running around just make sure to offer your dog ample water.  Dogs do well with a schedule, however, it is sometimes useful to mix things up a little. This is especially the case if your dog appears bored. So, do your same routine with a slight variation. Go to a different dog park. Change your walking path. Introduce a new toy. Your dog will then trust you to get them safely through this new experience., You can praise your dog by offering verbal encouragement or even treats. Just keep the positive reinforcement coming. This shows your dog that their good behavior is noticed and that they are an important part of your family. A confident dog is a happy dog. It is easy to offer praise when you first get a pet, but make sure that you keep this up over time too.Offer up positive encouragement for minor actions as well. If your dog waits patiently at the door or doesn’t beg at dinner there is nothing wrong with offering a quick treat. Couple this with a smile and a happy, “Good job!”Remember that treats don’t have to break the bank. Most dogs will be satisfied with a few frozen peas or a small piece of cheese., Your dog is also bound to mess up and when this happens it is your job to stay calm and instruct them in the proper behaviors. When your dog misbehaves it is enough to simply say, “No,” in a firm voice. Do not, under any circumstances, use physical force to correct your dog. 

chill out at home.  take long walks or hikes.  play.  go out on the town.  break from routine.  reward positive behaviors.  offer gentle correction for negative behaviors. 

 Cholera is most often passed through drinking or using water that has cholera bacteria in it. Getting your water from sources that you know are safe and clean can help you avoid contracting cholera.Adequate chlorination of local water supplies is essential. Even if water is treated with chlorine, if it is not enough (parts per million dose), then even treated water can pass on the cholera bacteria and infection can result. When in doubt, opt for boiled drinking water. Ask your host or accommodations if the water has been boiled, bottled or chemically treated. If he or she is unsure, seek a source that you know is safe. Use the same procedure for bottled or canned carbonated beverages. Check the seal of bottled and canned drinks to make sure that the seal isn’t broken. If it is, opt for a bottle or can that is clearly sealed. Consider wiping off the outside of the container before drinking bottled or canned beverages.Stay away from tap water and fountain drinks as they could contain contaminated water.Avoid ice cubes at all costs, as this can transmit the bacteria easily.; , You may not be able to find or access clean water sources. If this is the case, you can also safely disinfect your own water through methods such as boiling or filtering it.Disinfect your water by:   Boiling it for one minute Filtering it and adding two drops of household bleach or ½ iodine tablet per liter.  You may also find yourself in a remote area, perhaps while you are hiking, with no supplies such as a filter, bleach, or pot and pan. In these cases, you can use water purification tablets or powders. These are small and easy to carry. You may want to purchase them before you leave, as they may not be available once you are abroad.   Read the package labeling to see the strength of your specific purification tablet or powder. Consult the chart on the package to learn how many tabs you’ll need to purify the water you want to use. Remove the tablet from the strip and put it in the water. Stir with a clean utensil and cover your water. Wait 30 minutes before drinking and make sure to consume all of the water within 24 hours of purification. Consider using a chlorine liquid purifier called Dlo Lavi if you are in Haiti. Use one capful of the product per 5 gallons (20 liters) in clear water or two capfuls per 5 gallons (20 liters) if the water is very dirty or cloudy. As with purification tabs, stir the water with a clean utensil and cover it while waiting 30 minutes for your disinfected water. Again, make sure to use all of the purified water within 24 hours.  Whenever you disinfect or purify water, it’s important that it remains clean. Covering any purified source with a tight light can protect the water and ensure that it remains safe to use. This is also the case for sources like bottled water or canned beverages.  Just as drinking water contaminated with the cholera bacteria can make you sick, so can eating food prepared or cleaned in contaminated water. Try and eat only foods cooked freshly and completely through. Make sure any dishes are hot when they arrive to you.Make sure any food you purchase from street vendors is cooked in front of you and is served hot. Stay away from any raw or undercooked meats and seafood.This includes sushi.You may want to avoid all seafood in endemic areas. Consider pre-packaged foods if you are unsure of a food source., Most people love fruits and vegetables, which can also be a good alternative for a person who may not like or be unsure of meat. But just as it’s important to eat thoroughly cooked foods, so it is to check your fruits and vegetables to ensure they are not contaminated with cholera.Stay away from unpeeled fruits and vegetables. This includes salads or dishes with fruits like grapes and berries. If any unpeeled fruits or vegetables are in a dish, make sure they’re thoroughly cooked.Consider sticking to fruits and vegetables that you can peel yourself such as bananas, oranges, and avocados.  Dairy foods such as ice cream are often contaminated with cholera. Staying away from dairy products and unpasteurized milk may minimize your risk of cholera. If you want to consume dairy, make sure it comes from a known source and is both sealed and pasteurized before consumption., If you are traveling to a specific region of the world that still experiences cholera outbreaks, it may be useful to check to see if there is a current cholera outbreak. This can remind you to be extra vigilant about taking preventative measures to avoid contracting cholera.   Call the country’s embassy or local consulate or consult its website. Either may be able to provide you with information on cholera outbreaks. The United States Department of State provides a list of all embassies and consulates in the US at http://www.state.gov/s/cpr/rls/dpl/32122.htm. Consult the websites of international organizations that track health issues and often have information on current cholera outbreaks. These include the World Health Organization or International Committee of the Red Cross.You can also call the CDC at 877-FYI-TRIP (394-8747) or visit their website for travelers at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel.  If you’re in areas with a known cholera outbreak or with unsanitary water, it’s important to be especially vigilant about washing your hands. This can minimize your risk of contracting the disease or spreading it to someone else. You can use either soap and water or hand cleanerWash with clean water and soap. Rub your soapy, wet hands together for at least 20 seconds. Clean between your fingers, under your nails, and up your wrists. Make sure to rinse thoroughly.Use an alcohol-based hand cleanser if no water is available. Make sure that is at least 60% alcohol. Consider buying sanitizer before you leave so that you have it on hand if you get into a situation where you don’t have water but can’t buy sanitizer.Make sure to clean your hands when you prepare food, before you eat, and any time you use the restroom.  Dishes washed in water contaminated with cholera can also infect food placed on them, and in turn you. Make sure that you or anyone with whom you are traveling washes dishes in bottled, boiled, or chemically treated water., You’ll need to maintain your own hygiene while traveling and brushing your teeth is a vital part of that. Brushing your teeth with water from unknown or dirty sources can also increase your risk of getting cholera.Remember that exposure to even a small amount of water contaminated with cholera can infect you, even if it’s just to brush your teeth. Use only bottled, boiled, or chemically treated water to brush your teeth. If these aren’t available, consider carrying some portable brushes that have toothpaste that you can chew or even chewing a piece of gum. Use these until you can find a safe water source to brush your teeth.  There is a relatively low risk of contracting cholera when you are traveling and most doctors don’t recommend getting vaccinated. If you are especially concerned about the disease or going to be in an area with a cholera outbreak for an extended period, such as doing missionary or humanitarian work, you may want to consider getting a cholera vaccine. Be aware that the traditional injected version is only minimally effective at preventing cholera. In addition, the two oral vaccines are not available in the United States.Talk to your doctor or local health care provider if you are interested in the vaccines. The two oral cholera vaccines that the WHO has prequalified are Dukoral and ShanKoe. Be aware that no country requires immunization for cholera as a condition of entry.  If you show any of the signs or symptoms of cholera, get to a doctor immediately. Cholera can quickly turn fatal, even in the healthiest individuals. Seeing a doctor can ensure you get proper and prompt treatment if you do have cholera or another disease.Tell the doctor why you are visiting the office. Let him or her know what your symptoms are and when they started. You may also want to inform the doctor if you’ve had any dirty water and if you’ve been using methods such as purification tabs to clean your water. The symptoms of cholera include large volume depletion through rice-water-colored diarrhea. It is imperative that supportive measures be taken to replenish hydration and electrolyte loss, as dehydration can be fatal.  

drink only from sources of clean water.  disinfect your water.  purify your water with tablets.  keep water sources covered.  eat completely cooked and hot food.  take care with fruits and vegetables.  avoid dairy.  inform yourself about ongoing outbreaks.  wash your hands frequently.  keep dishes uncontaminated with clean water.  brush teeth with water from clean sources.  consider vaccination.  seek medical attention.

 Before you leave home, let someone know where you are going and when you expect to be back. You might also want to send them a quick text when you arrive at your destination. If they don’t receive your text, or you don’t arrive home when expected, they can check to make sure everything is OK.You can also download an app such as FindMyFriends that allows you to share your location with others, as well as find friends nearby. Several of these apps also contain ways to quickly broadcast your location in an emergency situation.; , By knowing exactly how you are getting to your destination, you will reduce your travel time and reduce the chances of getting lost in an unfamiliar area. You will also feel and appear confident, which reduces your chance of being approached by trouble makers., Always have a fully charged cell phone with you. If you are in trouble, you can quickly call for help. You might also need your phone to use mapping or other functions to get you to your destination safely., A simple whistle is often the easiest way to chase off trouble makers. Pepper spray, which will incapacitate an attacker, is also an option if it is legal in your area.Pepper spray needs a little practice to use correctly. Get comfortable using your thumb to push the button so you can hold the canister securely in the palm of your hand with the other four fingers. Learn how to unlock the safety switch quickly.

Flashy jewelry, large purses, expensive clothing and attention-grabbing antics can make you a target.  Look around while you walk and pay attention to what is going on around you. It will give you an early warning if someone is looking to make trouble. You’ll want to avoid earphones and any article of clothing, such as a hoodie, that might interfere with your hearing or vision.You don’t want to be distracted by chatting on your phone when walking, but it can sometimes make you feel safer to talk to someone when you are alone so they know where you are. Just make sure the conversation allows you to keep track of those around you.  Traveling at night, especially if you are alone, isn’t the time to try take new routes or short cuts through unfamiliar neighborhoods. If you must to venture into unfamiliar territory, make sure you have determined a route ahead of time so you don't end up lost. , Walk or drive in well-lit, highly visible areas. Even if it takes you longer, stay on a well-lit route rather than taking shortcuts down dark roads or paths. Stick to streets populated with houses and stores rather than empty lots or vacant stores.   Park in well-lit areas, as well. If it is still light when you park, visualize what the area will look like in the dark when you return. Look for overhead lights and park there. Always take note of where you park so that you can easily locate your car., When walking home or going to your car at the end of the evening, have your keys in your hand to allow quick entry into your home or car.

 One of the most common forms of biphobia is the denial of the very existence of bisexuality. Sometimes this denial is caused by malice, but just as often it is the result of misinformation.   Reputable studies clearly indicate that bisexuality is a very real fact of life for many people. Actually, one recent study revealed that more Americans self-identify as bisexual (3.1%) than gay or lesbian (2.5%). This would indicate that there are roughly ten million self-identified bisexuals in the U.S.Often, a denial of bisexuality is based more on the assumption that it is a temporary situation within a transition between hetero- and homosexuality. The typical view in this sense is that “bisexual” simply means “on the way to gay.”However, although it may not fit neatly into the binary views of existence (gay / straight, male / female, etc.) that many people tend to embrace, bisexuality is a very real state of being in and of itself.; , Those who do accept the existence of genuine bisexuality, and may even consider themselves supportive, can still harbor misconceptions and stereotypes that can add up to a less virulent but still harmful biphobia. Curiosity and questions should be welcomed, but “loaded” questions that indicate a prejudicial point of view need not be seen as acceptable.Some assumptions are clearly prejudicial, such as saying that a bisexual is just “confused” or “lying to himself,” needs to “make up her mind already,” is “trying to have it all” or avoid the difficulties of being identified as homosexual, is “just going through a phase,” or is just “trying to look cool.” Even if there is supportive intent, such statements denigrate the distinctive existence of bisexuality. You have every right to respond to such questions or views by clarifying that bisexuals are not “undecided” or “confused” — they are living life on their terms. Don’t be hostile or judgmental yourself, especially when dealing with someone who wants to be supportive; educate them on what it means to be bisexual.  Many people simply place people in the binary categories of “heterosexual” or “not heterosexual,” often with the first option as the only “right” one. In so doing, they conflate homosexuals, bisexuals, and anyone else who does not fit neatly into these two supposedly rigid categories.Some people will simply have trouble believing that a bisexual is anything other than a homosexual who is literally “trying to have it both ways” out of confusion or convenience. Be prepared to address the differences between homosexuality and bisexuality, while confirming their equal rights to respect and tolerance. Even as a bisexual (or advocate for them), then, it pays to understand common prejudices more specifically targeted toward homosexuals as well. See How to Deal With Homophobia as a good reference.  Not surprisingly, you will find some of the strongest champions for bisexual rights among the gay and lesbian communities. At the same time, however, some people who crusade against homophobia can actually espouse strong biphobia, for various reasons.Advocates for gay and lesbian equality sometimes express biphobia because they see bisexuals as only “half” of an oppressed minority, or because they are defensive about guarding the unity and priorities of their specific cause.Homosexuals can be misinformed about bisexuality just as easily as heterosexuals, but are perhaps more likely to respond to reasoned discussions of the challenges and prejudices bisexuals face on a daily basis.  While a good deal of biphobia will be based on misinformation, confusion, or good intentions improperly expressed, it can be expressed in more virulent forms as well. Bullies target differences and perceived weaknesses, often seeking to avoid or ignore their fears or problems by attacking others.Identifying the likely causes of someone’s biphobic bullying can help you to counteract it. Understanding does not mean accepting or legitimizing the bullying, though. Consider factors like peer pressure, social / religious background, or factors unrelated to bisexuality that may be causing the person to lash out at a perceived “flaw” in someone else.  If you’re lucky, a healthy conversation with the bully may be enough to convince him to stop the behavior — if not necessarily change his mind on bisexuality. But, if you are subject to ongoing bullying (for whatever reason), never hesitate to talk to people you trust, like friends, teachers, counselors, etc.If you are harmed or fear for your safety, by all means contact the authorities. No one has to tolerate bullying.  

deny their denials.  address common misconceptions.  plan for biphobia conflated with homophobia.  counter possible biphobia from supporters of gay and lesbian rights.  understand bullying motivations.  don't stand for bullying, though. 

 This is ideal for cleaning a touchscreen. Some devices will have such a cloth included or perhaps you can borrow one you use on your sunglasses.   The cost of such cloth varies. For cloth recommended by companies for their products, the price can be considerably higher simply because of the recommendation. Look around for a good deal on such cloth or substitute with a cheaper but still effective microfiber cloth.; , It is usually much easier to see where to clean when the device is switched off.  This will remove the majority of simple imperfections.  It may actually be enough to just breathe over the screen and use that moisture to clean with.   Read the instructions accompanying the cloth you're using. Some of them need to be made slightly damp before use. If this is the case, skip this step and follow the cloth's instructions instead. If dampening a cloth, it is best to use distilled water or a cleaner specifically designed for cleaning touch screens.  Don't over-rub though! And if there is any dampness left, just leave it to air dry.   Do not put too much pressure on the screen when cleaning it.  To wash the microfiber cloth, soak it in warm, soapy water. The warm water serves to open the fibers and release the grime that may have gathered. Scrub the cloth lightly while soaking it (not too hard or you will damage the cloth). After soaking, avoid squeezing out any excess water, let the cloth out to air dry. If you're in a hurry, you may want to blow dry it. Do not wash any screens with the cloth until dry (or lightly damp) to the touch.  

choose a microfiber cloth.  turn off the device before commencing to clean it.  give the screen a once over by brushing it with the microfiber in small circles.  only if truly needed, moisten a cotton cloth, even the corner of your cotton shirt, and repeat the small circular motions.  brush again with the microfiber cloth to finish off.  wash the microfiber cloth. 

 Consider whether he is able to bathe himself, use the restroom alone, make his own meals, get up the stairs and keep up his house. Also consider your loved one's ability to drive and manage finances. Ask yourself if she poses a danger to herself by forgetting important tasks, like taking pills, turning off the stove and locking the door.; , This could include home health aides, food delivery services, housekeepers, transportation services and family members that have attempted to help out. This will help you get things in perspective and decide on the next course of action.  Depending on his needs, options include assisted living facilities, independent senior communities and skilled nursing facilities (also known as nursing homes). These all fall under the umbrella category of long-term care facilities and may be named as such. If the appropriate facility does not exist at the local level, branch out to cities within commuting distance so your loved one does not feel abandoned by her family.  He can answer your questions and provide insight on issues you may not have thought about.  The money aspect of sending a loved one to a senior facility can be a major stress and if you can't afford to pay for the stay, you'll have to find another facility that is affordable. Alternatively, you can apply for your state's Medicaid program on behalf of your loved one if the facility you choose accepts state or federal funds.  Talk to your loved one to see what they think about each facility and get his opinion on his likes, dislikes and desires for his life after he leaves his home.  You can find out if it has the proper licenses for operation and see any complaints that have been filed against it. If you know the names of the nursing staff, you can look them up as well.  Examples include Continuing Care Accreditation Commission (CCAC), the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF). The American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging (AAHSA) is a group of not-for-profit nursing homes, and some people prefer these facilities to for-profit senior homes because they are perceived to care more about the residents' best interests.  

decide which level of care is appropriate for your loved one.  make a list of options that have already been tried, as far as helping your loved one manage his affairs.  explore the options available locally after you have assessed your loved one's needs and the gaps that need to be filled when it comes to receiving care.  call your state's long-term care ombudsman to get information on choosing the best senior facility for your loved one.  talk to the staff at each facility about finances.  visit the senior homes on your list multiple times to get a feel for what daily life is like for the residents.  look up the facility you have chosen on your state's department of health website.  contact independent agencies that evaluate long-term care facilities to see if they have any information about the facility you have chosen.

 Though standard crib mattresses are required to be a minimum of 27-1/4 inches (69.2 cm) wide by 51-5/8 inches (131.4 cm) long; some mattresses are larger to fit larger cribs. Purchase a mattress that fits your crib snugly.; , Your new crib mattress needs to be very firm to reduce the risk of your baby suffocating due to sinking into a softer surface. There is an easy test that you can do to confirm that your baby's mattress is safely firm enough.    Foam options tend to be less expensive, but you must make sure that the foam is firm and dense and doesn't allow the baby to sink into the mattress. Innerspring mattresses typically cost more but offer higher durability. If you choose innerspring, select a mattress that has between 135 to 150 coils with a gauge lower than 15.5. These numbers should be found on the packaging. These guidelines are set by Consumer Reports and will guarantee the mattress you choose is firm enough for your baby. Consider purchasing a dual-sided mattress: usually one side is designed for babies and the other for toddlers, extending the mattress lifespan considerably.  The best mattress options have multiple layers of laminate coating that's been strengthened with nylon. These mattress choices have the added benefit of increased durability, which means less chance of tears or holes.  This means it has met the standards set by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and is safe for use.  A quality mattress should have small reinforced holes on both sides that allow air to circulate in and out of the mattress interior. These vents will help keep the mattress fresher by allowing odors to escape.  Because these mattresses can be very expensive, and not all products labeled organic are truly 100% natural, make sure the one you choose has been certified by Oeko-Tex Standard 100. This certification insures that the mattress is free of heavy chemicals and metals.  

measure the width and length of your crib.  check the firmness of the mattress you are purchasing.  decide whether you prefer a foam or an innerspring mattress.  choose a mattress with a very thick cover, which is also known as ticking.  verify that the mattress has been certified.  inspect the mattress for vent holes.  consider an organic mattress if you are concerned with the human-made chemicals, such as flame retardants that are in standard mattresses. 

 Add an even layer of white granulated sugar to a light-colored, heavy-bottomed saucepan or skillet. As you heat the sugar, it will release its water and caramelize.          As this method requires no other ingredients, the exact quantity of sugar is unimportant. Go for one or two cups, depending on how much caramel you need.  Watch the caramel closely as it heats - it should begin to liquefy around the edges, turning from a clear liquid to a golden brown color.          As the sugar begins to brown, use a silicone spatula or a wooden spoon to move the liquefied sugar from the edges of the saucepan to the center. This will ensure the sugar on the outside doesn't begin to burn before the sugar on the inside has melted. If you have a very thick layer of sugar in the saucepan, be careful that the sugar at the bottom of the pan doesn't begin to burn before you realize.  The sugar will probably melt unevenly, so don't worry if it looks lumpy in some parts, but is liquid in others. Just lower the heat and continue to stir. This will ensure that the caramel doesn't burn as you wait for the stubborn lumps to melt.          It doesn't matter if you can't get all of the lumps to melt - you can easily strain your caramel afterwards to remove them. Be careful not to over stir the caramel either - if you do, the sugar may start to clump up before it has a chance to melt. Don't worry though. If this happens, just turn the heat to very low and refrain from stirring until the sugar begins to melt again., Carefully watch the caramelizing sugar until it reaches exactly the right color - no more no less. Perfect caramelized sugar should be a dark, amber color - almost the color of an old copper penny.          You will know your caramel is finished when it is just past the smoking point. If you take it off before it smokes, it will be slightly undercooked. You can also gauge if your caramel is done by the smell - it should be deep and rich smelling, with a slight nuttiness.  Once your caramel hits perfection, don't waste any time in removing it from the heat. Caramel can go from perfect to burnt very quickly, and burnt caramel is bitter and unusable.          If you're using the caramel for a flan or crème caramel, you can pour the caramel directly from the saucepan into the molds. If you're making spun sugar, it's important that you stop the caramelization process by dunking the bottom of the saucepan in ice water. Otherwise the residual heat from the saucepan could burn the caramel. If you're making a caramel sauce, immediately add butter or cream to the caramel. This will stop the caramel from cooking and create a wonderfully creamy topping for ice creams and desserts. Just be careful, as the molten caramel can splatter when the dairy is added. 

add sugar to a heavy-bottomed saucepan.  heat the sugar over a moderate heat.  deal with any lumps.  watch the color.  take the caramel off the heat.  finished.  

 Give away clothes, recycle dens/pets/clothes and such, and recycle some animals. Other users will appreciate any clothing or other items you don't want, so make someone else happy by giving them away to others who need them.  Choose ones that complement your new way of life.  Build new relationships to help you move forward.  Rather than resenting the life you're leaving, be excited about the one you're building.  

first, get rid of your old life.  buy new clothes/dens/animals/pets.  delete friends and only keep close friends.  focus on the positive aspects of your new life. 

 Combine ¼ cup of salt and ½ cup of baking soda into a large pot filled with water. Add the yellowed items, then boil for 30 minutes. It is not uncommon for larger, thicker items such as tablecloths to require repeated boilings or be left for longer periods of time to whiten., Once you have removed your cotton or linen from the pot, move it to the sink. Run it under cold water, making sure to turn the item until it it soaked and you are sure all the cleaner is removed. This prevents it from turning brown and degrading later.   You may also want to lay the cloth flat out under the sun to dry. Avoid bunching the fabric so that it doesn’t stretch. Avoid the dryer, as it can also stretch and dull the fabric.  Add a half a cup of salt into the wash cycle to give washable fabric renewed color. This works great on preserving new clothing as well as restoring fabrics that have begun to fade., Combine four tablespoons of salt to one quart of water. Use a cloth or sponge to apply the saltwater to the stains. Gently work the water into the stains, letting it soak and adding more as needed, until the stains disappear and you can wash the clothing normally., Combine two tablespoons of salt to one quart of cold water. Soak the stained clothing in the saltwater for an hour. Afterwards, wash the clothing as normally, either using a washing machine or hand washing in warm, soapy water.   Fabric that can take high heat, such as cotton and linen, can be boiled in a pot of water after washing for extra effect. 

boil yellowed cotton and linen.  rinse in cold water.  brighten colors.  remove perspiration stains.  neutralize blood stains. 

 A fall from a great height is an overwhelming, frightening experience. You must focus on the task at hand to maximize your chances of landing safely. Avoid the temptation to hold your breath, and try to breathe evenly. Relaxing your limbs will also reduce your risk of serious injuries, as locked joints are much more likely to be harmed by impact.  If you are falling from a very significant height, such as from a tall building or an airplane, you will have time to alter your body position by creating air resistance with your upper body. Spreading your arms will help your upper body "drag" more in the air, slowing it down and allowing your legs to catch up., Tilting your head back will further increase the air resistance of your upper body, allowing you to shift from a head-first falling position more quickly. Be aware that you only want to do this position as you're trying to slow your fall — you will eventually want to protect yourself during impact by tucking your chin against your chest.  If you are falling into water, then you should point your legs directly towards the surface of the water. This will allow your legs to absorb most of the force from the fall. Experts disagree as to what position is best for landing on a solid surface, but a feet-first or full-body landing are both certainly preferable to a head first landing.To achieve a full-body landing, you should spread your legs out behind you as you transition from a head-first falling position. This will even out the air resistance of your body, allowing you to point your chest and belly towards the ground.  Head trauma is a frequent cause of fatal injury while falling. As you are about to land, wrap your arms around your head, being sure to protect the side facing the ground. Your arms may be injured, but you will increase your odds of surviving the fall.  

remain calm.  spread your arms.  arch your neck.  use your legs to control your landing position.  protect your head before hitting the ground. 

 In a small bowl, mix 1 teaspoon (7 g) of honey and 1 teaspoon (4.5 g) of coconut oil. Use a spoon to carefully blend the two together so they’re fully incorporated.If you don’t have coconut oil, you can substitute olive or jojoba oil.  When the honey and coconut oil are mixed, sprinkle in 1 teaspoon (4 g) of brown sugar. Stir the mixture until the sugar is fully incorporated, and the scrub has a thick, smooth texture.If you want the scrub to have additional flavor, you can mix in a few drops of vanilla or almond extract. If the texture of the scrub is too thin, mix in more brown sugar a little at a time. If the texture of the scrub is too thick, mix in more honey a little at a time.  When the scrub is mixed to the right consistency, use the spoon to place it in a small container that has a lid. Store the scrub in the refrigerator to keep it fresh.To use the scrub, rub a small amount over your lips for at least 30 seconds. There’s no need to wipe or rinse it off. It’s completely edible so you can just lick it off.  

combine the honey and coconut oil.  mix in the brown sugar.  place the scrub in a container and store in the fridge. 

 Whether it be a sport, arts and crafts, drama, or whatever else it is that interests you, take the time to do this activity every day or week. This will ensure that you are taking some time out to relax and have fun. This has far-reaching good effects. You will be socializing, enjoying your favorite hobby, and feeling a sense of achievement, all of which help combat stress. It will also take your mind off the stress of school, even for just a few hours, which will give you an important stress-free time each day.  If you have a locker, put up one or two pictures on the door. Get a pencil case and school bag you really like and feel free to decorate them as you wish. Just little things like these may seem silly, but they really do help you to feel more relaxed and at home. They are a way of carving out your own personal space, mental and physical, at school, and having your own space is important in making the place less stressful.  It's easy to be stressed when you're hungry, so make sure to eat a good lunch, and snack throughout the day if you get hungry. In addition, while pizza and other junk food can taste good, it won't provide you with the nutrients you need to be happy and healthy throughout your day. Opt for a healthy lunch that will keep you going all day - you'll find that this helps reduce your stress levels and has positive effects on your life in general.   Eat lunch with friends in order to have fun, relax, and take your mind of the stressful aspects of school in the middle of each day. This can give you a much-needed break that will keep you going through the end of the day.  Give yourself little rewards now and then to encourage your hard work. Bring in a nice treat for your lunch, go out with your friends each weekend, have some alone time and read your favorite book or watch your favorite movie each night. Find some small things that you really like to do and do them at the end of each day or week.  When you get home from school, give yourself a half hour to an hour to just relax. You won't be able to learn anything if you're stressed and grumpy. Do some exercise, meditate, read a book, or go for a walk. This will clear your mind and get you nice and energized before you get started on that homework. When studying for long periods of time, take a 10 minute study break every hour to keep your mind and body focused and fresh throughout your study session.

 Also you can find a friend or someone you know who is in an organization that marches and go with them.; ,,,,,,,, Obviously. It is a parade after all. There will always be people in the forefront so don't worry of not knowing where to go.  Wave at the onlookers and march on the outside so you can give high fives to all the enthusiastic people in the crowds!  , Your pick will depend on your budget and the way you want to celebrate. If you want more of a frat kind of feel to drinking and being "Irish", go to the plethora of bars with cramped, jam-packed bodies and no room to breathe. If you want more of a classy way to celebrate, are hungry and have quite a bit more money, try going to a nice restaurant or steakhouse. I recommend: The Atlantic Grill, Smith & Wolensky's, and Rothman's. Any other restaurants you find you like, will do just fine. Just make sure to not go to an Italian or Chinese restaurant or anything with ethnic foods because, although those foods are extremely tasty as well, on this one day to celebrate Irish heritage, it would defeat the purpose. Go to a neutral place at best.  Have at it! Don't forget to be responsible! ;)  ,

 Do not try to remove the sticky seed from the dog with your bare hand or it is most probable that the seeds will become more embedded into the fur. Instead, use pantyhose, which are are excellent at removing sticky seeds with little distress to your animal.  Place your open hand into one of the legs of the pantyhose and run your hand down to the foot-bed of the pantyhose., Run your covered hand over the dog's fur. As the sticky seeds become attached to the pantyhose, move your hand to a clean area in the pantyhose leg. Repeat the process of running the pantyhose hand over the dog's fur., If there are seeds you cannot remove, then those seed might need to be removed with the tips of your fingers or, if the seeds are embedded, use a rounded tip pair of scissors to remove the remainder seeds and snip only small amounts of fur., Once your dog is seed-free, brush as usual and settle down together for a nice treat. 

do nothing using bare hands.  find an old pair of pantyhose (or a new, cheap pair if you do not have an old pair).  spread your hand open while in the pantyhose foot-bed.  repeat this pantyhose-hand rubbing process until you have removed as many sticky seeds as you can.  done.

 If you’re looking to get your stories noticed by editors and readers, consider submitting work to literary magazines. There are hundreds of literary publications with calls for work on a rolling basis. A list of literary journals and magazines can be found here.   Each literary magazine has a unique perspective and a unique readership, so its important to read the literary publication before you submit work to the publication. This will help you get a sense of the voice, style, and genre(s) of writing the magazine publishes. You can then determine if your stories might be a good fit with the mandate of the magazine.Always follow the submission guidelines of the publication’s submission page, as most publications will not read submissions that do not follow their guidelines. You will also need to send a short cover letter with your submission that includes your bio and any previous publications.  Many literary publications will hold writing competitions for the best short story in a certain genre or around a certain theme. These competitions can lead to monetary rewards, as well as publication in the magazine. Most competitions are judged by esteemed writers who will read and choose from a shortlist of finalists. So this means your current living literary hero could potentially read and choose your writing from the pile.   Keep in mind there is often a fee for submitting work to writing competitions to cover a reading fee and to help support the publication. Before you submit to a competition, read back issues of the magazine and the work of previous year’s winners to get a feel for what type of writing the magazine tends to publish.  Self publishing, or DIY direct, means the author does all the work on their own and hires any outside help like a book designer or an editor. Self publishers will also need to provide retailers (book sellers) with finished, ready to go files or books.If you are feeling frustrated by traditional publishing avenues and want to get your stories noticed on your own terms, self publishing may be an option.   Keep in mind the retailer will take a cut of the sales, but the author is not exclusive to a publisher. This means the author can deal with each retailer on an individual basis. Self publishing allows the author to maximize their earnings from the sale of the books. This also allows the author to get the highest percentage of sales. The author also retains complete freedom over the work so they can adjust or edit it on the fly, and can control the pricing of the book. But, self publishing can become a full time job if the author is aiming for high profit and high quality. You will need to also market and promote your book on your own to find an audience for your work.  

submit your stories to literary magazines.  enter short story competitions.  consider self publishing your stories in a collection. 

 You’re going to broil the cheese for each serving directly in its bowl with the soup already inside, so make your favorite tomato soup recipe beforehand. While that’s cooking, preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). Then line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place your four serving bowls on top., Once your soup is cooked, divide it between four oven-safe bowls in equal portions. Next, lightly spread butter over one side of four separate slices of bread. Place each slice directly on top of the soup with the buttered side facing up. Divide 1 cup (113 g) of grated cheddar cheese into quarters and then top each slice with one quarter.Because the bread is placed directly on the soup, buy a full loaf and slice it yourself, nice and thick, so it doesn’t weaken in the liquid. Pre-sliced sandwich bread may be too thin and will probably end up dissolving in the soup.  Place the baking sheet in your preheated oven. Set a timer for 15 minutes. Once it goes off, check the cheese. If it has browned and started to bubble, it’s good to go. If not, give it another five minutes and check again. Once it’s done, give it a minute or two to cool off before serving.To deepen the color for a more golden brown, transfer the baking sheet from the oven to under the broiler for another five minutes. Warn guests that the bowls were in the oven and will be extremely hot to the touch.  

prep for broiling.  fill your bowls.  melt your cheese and then serve. 

 Older dogs like things to stay the same. They are often set in their ways, and find comfort in routine. For instance, try to keep their feeding schedule, exercise routine, and sleeping environment the same. This will allow them to have a stable and comfortable environment as they age. If their environment remains a source of comfort than they may not become as clingy.For example, if they normally sleep in your room, do not move them to a different place because they have started waking up in the middle of the night. They are likely just anxious and need comforting. Moving them to a new place may cause more anxiety and clinginess.  Some dogs will become more clingy in their old age because they are losing their senses. For example, they may find it much harder to see and hear as they age. As a result, they want to be close to you so that they feel safe and comforted. If you notice signs of vision loss (bumping into walls and furniture), or hearing loss (lack of response when you call them), you should try the following tips:Do not move furniture. You may feel that moving around furniture and opening up the house will make it easier for your dog to navigate. It is especially important to keep their bed, food and water bowls, and toys in the same place. Scent the rooms in your house differently, so that they determine where they are based on the small.  Another way to keep your dog comfortable as they age is to continue providing them with daily exercise. You may feel that you should stop walking them because they are getting older, but it is actually important to continue their exercise routine. This can actually help them to delay some of the signs of aging. If your dog has become more clingy they will also enjoying engaging in activities with you.Do not strain your older dog by taking them on a long and strenuous walk. Instead, take them for a short walk up the street to stimulate them and give them a mild form of exercise. If they have mobility issues, then you can engage in gentle play at home.  If your dog is feeling disoriented as a result of vision or hearing loss and aging, you should provide them with some added attention and comfort. What may appear to be additional clinginess, could actually just be your dog trying to locate you in the house. For example, if your older dog is struggling with vision and hearing they may want to stay close to you so that they do not get lost and feel alone or abandoned.   Provide your dog with gentle contact so that they know you are close. If you see that your dog is disoriented, you should slowly approach them and then touch them so that they can reorient themselves to you.  

create a stable routine.  keep their environment the same.  walk your dog daily.  give your dog attention. 

 Texture describes the way a rock looks. Grain size is the main texture you look for when classifying igneous rock. Grain size is the size of the individual mineral crystals in the rock.Coarse-grained (phaneritic) describes rocks with large crystals. Most intrusive rocks are considered coarse-grained because of their large crystals. Fine-grained (aphanitic) describes rocks with crystals that are too small to see with the naked eye. Most extrusive rocks are considered fine-grained rocks. Rocks that cool quickly may have trapped bubbles of gas called vesicles. The texture of these rocks is vesicular. Porphyritic texture rocks have both fine-grained and coarse-grained crystals., You can examine the chemical composition of a rock just by looking at it. Minerals vary in color, and the color tells you what chemicals are in the rock. The most common chemicals are silica, iron, and magnesium.Light colored minerals (often called felsic) have more silica in them and are often white, gray, pink, or colorless. Dark-colored minerals (often called mafic) have more iron and magnesium in them are usually black, brown, dark gray, or green.  Igneous rock can be classified as felsic, intermediate, mafic, and ultramafic. These classifications apply to both extrusive and intrusive rocks.Felsic rocks are the lightest, and ultramafic rocks are the darkest.Felsic rocks have the highest silica content (65% +). Common examples of felsic rocks are rhyolite (extrusive rock) and granite (intrusive rock). Intermediate rocks have about 55-65% silica content and are a little darker than felsic rocks. Common examples of intermediate rocks are andesite/dacite (extrusive rock) and diorite/granodiorite (intrusive rock). Mafic rocks are low in silica (45-55%) and are dark in color. Common examples of mafic rocks are basalt (extrusive rock) and gabbro (intrusive rock). Ultramafic rocks have the lowest silica content (less than 45%) and may have a green tint. Common examples of ultramafic rocks are peridotite (intrusive rock) and komatiite (extrusive rock).  

examine the texture of the rock.  examine the chemical composition.  know the four classifications of igneous rock. 

 Do you want an animal club, a sports club, a collector's club or maybe a club of super fans of a music group or a movie,or a nature lover club, or maybe just a club to hang with your friends? Maybe even a tree house club! There are many reasons for forming a club, but the most important thing is to follow your passion. Ask your friends for their ideas too.; , Get a binder or folder to keep all of your club documents in. Maybe decorate it to make it colourful and customised. We will add more to it later.  Put all the club meeting dates, locations, and trips on it. Let all of your members have a say in it. You should probably have a scheduled "planning meeting" so you and all of your club members can plan together when everything happens.  An interesting, fun, attractive name will help to attract members. Maybe all your names put together or something to do with the club like Book Buddies. You may also like to consider whether it is possible to abbreviate your name so that it sounds great when shortened. For example, M.U.S.I.C. might stand for Mixing Universal Soul Inspiration Club.  It is best if you can use the room or area regularly and even better if you can decorate it to make it look like your club. But this isn't always possible, so you might like to develop a portable kit of signs, banners and other club objects that you can set up anywhere to make any room or space transform into your club when meeting.   If you want you can meet in somebody's bedroom, den or treehouse. If you have permission from an adult then you could meet at the park or a local cafe.  If you know somebody who can make clothes, you're in luck. Make your own club colors, too. However, some club members may not like the idea of a club uniform, so make sure to ask their opinion about it first.   Uniforms increase the cost and effort of members. Keep that in mind before insisting that there be one. A simple t-shirt with the club's logo or name might suffice and is an affordable way of developing a "uniform" of sorts.  A club website or wiki can be really helpful for arranging meetings and passing on all communications. You can use a free service such as Yola or Google Sites to make a website. Or, you can start a wiki.  Many formal clubs have a "constitution". That is fairly formal, so you might like to just start with a basic list of rules that apply to your club; if your club becomes more developed, a constitution could be created and voted on at a later stage. Consider things such as:   Membership fees Office positions and who can hold these positions Meeting dates, or regularity Annual general meeting requirements Funding Volunteering Activities (what the club exists to do, what activities it promotes, what activities it does not want, etc.)  , Make sure that all members are aware what the club does and what they can and cannot do. This is especially important if someone keeps breaching the basic rules and making the club unpleasant for others; you can point to the rules and say "no more or you're out".  People will want to join if you tell what the club and its reason-for-being are all about, so prepare some fliers or posters with this information.   Make a list of people. Take all of the members that you came up with before and make a nice looking list. Make sure you have lots of room to add more people.  If you don't have lots of ideas yet, don't worry, just let them know this. It is better to be honest and find people who can help build up your club than to have people scratching their head about why you cannot provide all the things that you told them the club offered. Many people like to join a club when it is just starting, as they can get a position in it easily and help build it up with you.   You can also have the existing members list some ideas.  You might ask the members for a small donation or contribution. Maybe you won't need money but can ask members to donate time, food for meetings, paper for posters, skills such as drawing / painting / sign creation etc. The more who pitch in, the less money will be needed for running it. Money is more likely to be an issue as the club grows in size and activities.  When your club is small, it is important to ensure that everyone is free to come at a set time. If your club grows in size, still try to accommodate as many people as possible but realize that the more members you have, the harder it will be to ensure that everyone can make the same meeting time.  This will help everyone to know in advance that something is happening. The agenda doesn't have to be long or even closely followed; it is just a great way of organizing the meeting time so that it benefits all the members.   Consider having different things to do at each meet-up, to keep things fresh and interesting.  Ensure that there are plenty of places for members to sit, that it's easy to hear or see demonstrations and that there is actually enough room for everyone.   Bring refreshments like chips and soda to meetings. Members can be asked to donate something each meeting, and occasionally you might even have a potluck supper or a shared picnic.  Accomplishments help make a club better and give the members a sense of purpose. Accomplishments could be things such as being a good friend, self improvement, creating things, providing help, etc. These achievements could be acknowledged through badges, certificates, ribbons and even trophies, depending on what the achievement is.  If your club has a focus on something that you and all the members really care about, you might like to raise money as a club to send to a larger, more official organization such as the ASPCA in New York or SPCA in Canada if you like animals, or the Sierra Club if you care about the environment or a local tree-planting group if you care about trees and your neighborhoods amenities etc. Schools, local hobby groups, local sports teams etc. are other possible target groups for your club's fund-raising efforts. Make sure people know your club exists.  

decide on what kind of awesome club you'd like to have.  organize and plan.  create a calendar.  choose an interesting name.  find an area where your club can meet.  if you would like, you can have club uniforms.  develop a website, wiki or other online club portal.  decide on basic rules.  be clear.  get some members to join your club.  be ready to explain when people ask about the club's purpose.  think of ways to get some money to put into your club.  determine meeting times according to the availability of the club's members.  have an agenda for meet-ups and meetings.  make the meetings comfortable.  put in place a way to achieve things by being part of the club.  raise money for a cause. 

 It's best to start any yoga practice with a moment of meditation to bring your focus to your breath and tune out the outside world. This is especially important if you're going to be working on your balance, which depends on sharp mental focus.Meditate upright in mountain pose to get solid standing and distribute your weight evenly across all four corners of your feet. Having this foundation will make it easier to balance. To stand in mountain pose, stand straight with your feet either together or no more than hip's width apart. Distribute your weight evenly so that your feet are flat on the ground. Roll your shoulders back so that your shoulder blades are melting down your back. The inner creases of your elbows should be in front, palms splayed out. Extend your arms gently to the side or overhead, and take a moment to correct to your breath. With every inhale, think of grounding yourself to the earth. With every exhale, think of reaching for the sky.  While chair pose isn't necessarily a balancing pose, it can help strengthen and firm up your quads and glutes, which are essential for maintaining good standing balance.From mountain pose, lower your hips as you exhale. Move as though you are going to take a seat on a chair behind you, taking care not to let your knees push out over your toes. Only lower as far as you comfortably can. Ideally, your thighs will be parallel to the floor and your shins will be perpendicular to the floor. Breathe into this pose, pressing your palms together in front of your chest and holding the pose for three to five breaths before rising back into mountain pose.  While tree pose is considered an easy balancing yoga pose, it may present a challenge if you haven't worked on your balance very much. Make sure you have a sturdy chair, table, or wall that you can use to catch yourself.From mountain pose, shift your weight to your right foot and lift your left foot off the ground. Try to shift your weight without leaning – this will help your balance. Bend your left knee and tuck your left foot inward, as though you were going to sit cross-legged. Rest your left foot on your right inner thigh, at whatever height is comfortable for you. Engage your core and relax your shoulders. Focus your gaze on a spot two to three feet in front of you on the floor. Try to bring your palms together in front of your chest. If that balance is too difficult, you also can hold your arms out to the side to assist in balance. Hold this pose for a couple of breaths if you can, then switch and do the other side.  These three basic poses can be done as a flow to further test your balance and provide a good exercise for your hips, glutes, and core. Move fluidly between poses with a breath for each movement.Start in mountain pose, and then on an exhale lower into chair pose. Pause between breaths, and then rise up to stand as you start to inhale. On an exhale, raise one foot into tree pose. Sit it down as you inhale and return to mountain pose. Repeat this flow three to four times. Don't forget to complete the flow twice, covering both sides in tree pose.  

meditate to increase your focus.  go from mountain pose into chair pose.  test your balance with tree pose.  flow from mountain to chair to tree. 

 No matter how excited your child is to start preschool, they also may feel a little nervous or scared. Help them understand preschool by giving them an idea of what it will be like. Tell your child where they will be going, what they will be doing, and what a normal day in preschool might include. Give them a sense of what will happen so that they can feel prepared to start with as little worry as possible.For example, say, “You are going to this building right here. I’ll drop you off at the door and say goodbye, then you’ll go inside and do lots of fun activities. You might sing, dance, color, draw, paint, or play. Then, you’ll have snack time and quiet time. When preschool is over, I’ll come back and pick you up!”; , Some schools have a meet day where children can come and explore their classroom and meet their teacher. Have your child meet the teacher, tour the school, and spend some time on the playground. Point to things around the classroom and show your child where they might sit. Let them look around the classroom and see what activities, games, and toys they can play with at school. This should help them get excited about coming.If your child’s preschool does not have this, they might have a parent-teacher meet day. If so, tell your child about the teacher and the classroom and let them know what kinds of things they can expect. You can also bring your child to the playground and let them play there.  Take turns being the child, teacher, and parent. Practice the roles and do common activities performed in preschool such as saying goodbye in the morning, hanging up a jacket, having circle time, singing songs, and reading stories. Let your child experience the different roles.When role playing, make preschool sound exciting and fun.  A great way to prepare your child for preschool is to read books about preschool. Your child can learn how their favorite characters deal with the changes that preschool brings. It can help them get a sense for what preschool will be like and how to adjust to it. Some books help children cope with the uncertainty or fears they have about making big transitions and being away from parents for a longer time.Read books specifically designed for getting a child ready for pre-school. Some books to check out from the library include, “Llama Llama Misses Mama,” “I Love You All Day Long,” “Maisy Goes to Preschool,” and, “What to Expect at Preschool.” 

tell them what to expect.  get familiar with the school.  play pretend preschool.  read books. 

 This unconventional trick can work surprisingly well, making it a favorite of many amateur cleaners on the internet.To start, find an old rag and dampen it with hydrogen peroxide. Lay your scorched item flat on your work surface and cover the scorch with the damp rag.   Hydrogen peroxide, a cleaning solution with mild bleaching properties, is usually available at grocery stores and pharmacies for quite cheap. If you have ammonia handy, you may also want to splash a few drops directly onto the scorch mark itself. Though ammonia and hydrogen peroxide are safe to use with each other (unlike ammonia and bleach), this isn't a mixture you'll want to ingest or rub into your face, so be sure to wash your hands when you're done.  Next, put a clean, dry rag on top of the hydrogen peroxide-soaked rag. To be perfectly clear, you want to have three things stacked on your work surface: on the bottom, your scorched item, in the middle, your peroxide rag, and on top, your dry rag.  Let your iron heat up to a fairly hot (but not extremely high) temperature. Start gently rubbing the top cloth. The heat will gradually permeate through the layers and into your scorched item, where it will help the hydrogen peroxide work into the scorch mark and start to remove it. Be patient — this process can take some time.  Check on your scorch mark frequently as you iron the top cloth. For mild to moderate scorch marks, you should notice steady, gradual improvement. If, at any point, you notice that the middle cloth is starting to dry out, remove it and give it another application of hydrogen peroxide. Similarly, if you initially sprinkled your scorched item with ammonia and you notice that it has dried out, give it a few more drops. Doing this keeps the cleaning process as quick and effective as possible.   You'll also want to remove the top cloth and replace it with another if it ever becomes soaked with hydrogen peroxide from the middle cloth. This prevents rust stains on the iron. 

cover the stain with a hydrogen peroxide-soaked cloth.  cover this with a dry cloth.  iron on medium-high heat.  replace liquids as they dry out. 

 It’s important to wait a few moments before responding to feedback, especially if it’s negative. You may regret responding with anger or extreme emotion after fully listening to what the other person has to say.Try taking three deep breaths after receiving feedback. If you still feel emotionally charged, take a few more breaths before responding.  In order to be receptive to feedback, it’s key that you are open and refrain from getting defensive. This, in part, means being open to opinions and ideas that may differ from your own. Instead of trying to justify your actions or blame someone or something else, carefully listen to what is being said.If your boss criticizes you for being late, don’t immediately launch into a defense about the challenges of getting the kids to school before work or the horrible traffic you encountered. Try saying, “I’m sorry I was late. I will make it a priority to be punctual from now on.” Other defensive reactions include accepting the feedback and then talking badly about the person behind their back or purposefully avoiding implementing the feedback out of spite. Being unresponsive to make the person uncomfortable, such as just staring and not answering their questions, is another example.  Before responding emotionally, it’s important to understand exactly what is being said to you. Asking for details allows the giver of feedback to clarify his or her criticisms, and provides you with a better understanding of what they are trying to convey.   If your daughter tells you she doesn’t like your cooking, urge her to clarify. Try saying, “Ashley, I’m sorry you are unhappy with my cooking. What particular dishes do you dislike?” If your co-worker praises your presentation, you can say, “Thanks for your feedback, Joe. What did you think I did particularly well? How can I improve?”  , Understand that feedback is usually about actions and behaviors, rather than the individual. Just because your boss sent you two hours of revisions on your last writing assignment doesn’t mean you are a poor writer. It just means there is room for improvement.   Try to separate yourself as an individual from the critique of your work.  

do not respond immediately.  don’t get defensive.  ask questions.  don’t take it personally.

 Many party stores have pre-made LEGO party invitations or you can tailor into your own more adult-focused style. If you can't find any, draw a LEGO brick design using a computer aided drawing program, color in a typical LEGO brick color and print off as many copies as needed.   Unless you're okay about kids coming along too, make no bones about the fact that this is not a party for kids. If you do have the party with kids too, you'll need to organize a separate entertainment corner or room in your house, along with a babysitter to keep a watchful eye on them. Schedule the party in the evening (after the kids have gone to bed). Make it clear whether guests should leave the kids at home (explain that it's LEGO for "adults only"). As part of the invitation wording, suggest that adults bring their sense of wonder and adventure––it’s a night in which adults can play like kids again. Include a fun (and cheap) package of LEGO bricks or a kit with your invitations. Many dollar stores have small kits, so if you're limiting your invites to 20 to 30 guests (or less), include a cute Lego kit along with the invite as an attention grabber. Or add a mini-figure to the invitation.; , Here you can let your imagination run wild as there are so many possibilities. However, to help inspire you, here are a few ideas:   Use red, yellow and blue for the main color theme, as these are the principal LEGO brick colors that everyone knows best. Hang streamers in red, yellow and blue from the ceiling and from tables to give a colorful effect. Also hang balloons up in the same colors. Raid your kid's Lego supplies and use these to adapt as decorations. Place a display LEGO construction on a sideboard, hang mini-figures from balloons and if you have a moving LEGO item, such as a train or car, set it to go around its track during the party. Print out LEGO brick pictures for the walls and stick them everywhere. Stick LEGO stickers on a tablecloth where buffet food is kept. LEGO posters can be hung up, if you have any.  No sippy cups here––this party's LEGO drinks need to have a bite and kick to them. Choose a brightly colored drink, similar to the colors used in Lego and add Lego style ice cubes.   Create a LEGO “Jolly Rancher” adult beverage. Definitely not for kids, but inspired by your favorite candy, create a vibrantly colored Jolly Rancher vodka drink. Both Jolly Ranchers and LEGOs have that bright, fun color so make several drinks using a variety of colors and flavors. To make this drink:  A few days before your party combine vodka with actual Jolly Rancher candy. Mix 1.75 liters (0.5 US gal) of vodka with approximately 12 Jolly Rancher candies (choose one flavor per bottle). Place the 12 unwrapped Jolly Ranchers at the bottom of each bottle and then fill the bottle with vodka––no mixing or shaking. The candy does the work for you. Make as many 1.75 liter (0.5 US gal) bottles as you want––the entire rainbow could be fun! Freeze the Jolly Rancher bottles before the party. Mix drinks to order with club soda, triple sec, Chambord or a variety of flavored liquors. Experiment in order to create your own signature LEGO drink.   Other drink ideas include cocktails that end up being blue, red or yellow, like the primary Lego bricks and you might even make jello shots which contain all three colors in layers.  Purchase a LEGO inspired ice brick tray or make your own “bricks.” The LEGO brick tray can be purchased online or from LEGO® stores, or you can use your child’s LEGO bricks instead but be sure that they're well cleaned. To use them:   Spray large LEGO brick pieces with nonstick spray and fill the inside with water. Freeze LEGO bricks and then carefully tap the plastic LEGO bricks until the ice is removed. Make several batches before your party so you have plenty of LEGO ice for drinks.  Of course, the traditional waffle broken into pieces would make for the perfect Lego food, however move beyond the predictable and give your LEGO party an adult flair with some of these food craft ideas:   Use a serrated knife to cut raw vegetables. Give the carrots, radishes, tomatoes and cucumbers a LEGO look by cutting up strips or blocks using a serrated knife. Partner with a little of your special guacamole or hummus dip and you have a healthy appetizer. For detailed instructions on turning vegetables and fruit into LEGO bricks, see How to make vegetable Lego bricks; this will really wow your guests but be sure to give yourself plenty of time to make them as they're fiddly. Build-a-sandwich. Apply the Lego concept to your food and let your guests build his or her own sandwich. Lay out all the fixings preferably from clean LEGO containers if possible) and let your guests determine how big (or how small) their sandwich. As an alternative you can do build-a-pizza, build-a-taco or build-a-salad or pasta. If you can't find LEGO containers, display food items in colorful platters and bowls to reinforce the Lego theme.  Bake some goodies in the shapes of LEGO bricks. For example, try creating a simple LEGO building block cake using a standard cake mix, colorful frosting and marshmallows:   Combine the cake mix ingredients according to the package directions. Pour the cake batter into a greased and/or floured cupcake or sheet cake pan. Bake as directed and then allow to cool. Using a serrated knife, carefully slice along the top to create a flat surface. Whether you're using cupcakes or a full cake, slice cake into rectangular shapes. Cut two marshmallows in half and apply each half to the cake to create a square. Use frosting to hold marshmallows in place. Frost liberally using store bought frosting, tinted with bright food coloring.  Beyond the typical LEGO games your child plays, these LEGO games will be even more fun after a few apps and cocktails.   Who am I? Break your group up into teams and supply each team a pile of Lego items that include pieces to make cars, trucks and people. Have everyone at the party write down a name of a person, place or thing on a small slip of paper (tell them not to show anyone else). Ask each guest to fold his or her slip of paper and place it in a hat. Mix the slips of paper and ask one member from each team to randomly select one slip of paper. Tell the team member not to show the paper to his or her teammate. Set the kitchen timer for 10 minutes and tell the team member who chose the slip of paper to build whatever was on that slip of paper. It’s up to his or her teammate to guess what he or she is building based on his or her teammate’s creation––the first team to correctly guess the right answer wins that round. Building blind. Just for fun, blindfold your guests and ask them to build a Lego sculpture using a pile of LEGO bricks in front of them. There’s no objective or goal––it's just fun to see which sculpture turns out the best or funniest. LEGO building contest. If your group is particularly competitive, purchase small, inexpensive LEGO sets and have a LEGO building contest. The object of the game is to build the structure the fastest with all pieces intact. Divide the pieces into separate piles on a table or on the floor and have guests line up next to each other. If you have a larger group and more complex building projects, divide guests into teams and set the timer for some challenging cooperative fun. Play LEGO toss. Set a range of trash cans or cups (depending on how hard you want to make it) in a row and have teams toss LEGO pieces in. The team that gets the most pieces in wins (you can set a time limit or a piece limit). Buy one of the many LEGO games available in stores. Divide into teams and play the games for prizes, either following the rules provided or making up the rules for the party.  

send out lego themed invitations.  decorate lego style.  make “grown up” lego inspired drinks.  make any lego drink extra authentic by adding lego “brick” ice cubes.  serve lego-inspired food.  bake a lego cake or cookies for dessert.  play crazy lego building games. 

 There is not a direct train between London and Moscow. You will first need to travel from London to a European city that has a direct train to Moscow. Good choices with direction connections include Paris and Berlin.Consider taking a train to Paris, France and staying for a day or two to see sites like the Louvre or Bastille. Take a train from London to Krakow, Poland. Spend a few days in Krakow exploring the royal treasures on Wawel Hill or Oscar Schindler’s Factory.  After you travel from London to your first European destination, you will need to switch trains. You can try booking back-to-back trains, so that you will not have a layover. You can also stop for a day or two and enjoy the destination before boarding a train to Moscow.   Consider spending a few days in Moscow to visit the Kremlin, Red Sqaure, and the Tretyakov Gallery.

 Simply being useful may not stop the feeling of being useless. In contrast, not contributing to society (leeching society's benefits) may create or amplify many negative feelings.; , In order to make some output, you need input. Take something or material, move it to a more useful place, or combine it with other materials to make something. Not all of us have access to the best inputs. There are no free inputs, but forward-thinking individuals have created things like the internet, which can be the next best thing to free inputs. Your local library is another source of cheap or free inputs. It may seem counter-intuitive when you intend to create something out of yourself, that the first thing you need to do is take some things in. But the truth is that in order to be a producer, you must first be a consumer. You cannot be productive based on a blank slate. , Smile and be polite to those you meet (even if your cat scratched up your favourite jacket last night). If you have suppressed negative emotions, people around you will sense this and get "a bad vibe", so find a friend to talk to.  Consider society like a sandbox. Each time you "get a stroke of luck", you get more sand to play with. Be thankful for this and the next time you get the chance, help somebody else (selfless acts will create a mutual positive feeling, see step 3).  When you tell/share a negative feeling with somebody else, let them share theirs, too. Try to balance up by sharing something positive as well. This will contribute to the people closest to you by letting them offload otherwise soul crushing feelings (step 3) and by mutual sharing and listening you are contributing by being a dependable character.   The opposite option would have been to just spew out your emotions and letting everybody else clean up the mess of emotions you poured over them.  This is both under- and overvalued. When you spot a chance to make a direct intervention (help an elderly with a door, give a snickers to the homeless guy at the corner) take the chance and do it with a smile.  Most of the times we are powerless to act against corruption and injustice, sometimes we can support a person being subjected to this by showing the victim (a co-worker who just got yelled at by their boss) that you agree with him/her. A few times in your life you'll get the chance to really tear things up (anonymously sending proof of your boss's corruption to a news agency, for instance). The feeling of victory is unbeatable.  A blood or blood-plasma shortage will force surgeons to give each patient less blood and plasma, replacing them with inferior products. The downside for you is that you walk home with a band-aid on you arm which discretely states you just did a selfless act.  Even if groups can be over-represented in statistics, this says nothing about each individual. ,, Register as a stem cell donor to help save people from leukemia.

 A table at hip height is ideal. Stand over the can so you can access it easily.; , Hold the knife so that is vertical, rather than at an angle. Grip the handle such that your fingers won't be in the way of the blade if it slips. The back of your hand should be facing up.   This method is more effective than attempting to saw the lid off using the blade of your knife. That will ruin your knife and potentially leave metal shavings in your food. Make sure the knife is completely extended and locked into place, so it won't slip. This method can also be done with a chisel or another sturdy, thin object similar to a pocket knife.  Use your second hand to lightly smack the back of the hand that's gripping the knife handle. This gentle smacking motion will cause the tip of the knife to puncture the lid of the can.   Do not smack too hard. You don't want to lose control of the knife. Smack with your hand open, and connect with your palm. This will help you maintain control.  Position the tip of the knife a few centimeters over and repeat the technique to puncture the can again.  Circle the entire lid, as you would with a can opener. The lid should now be loose.  Slip the tip of the knife into one of the holes. Use it to pry the lid off. Gently pull the lid from the can.   If necessary, use a smaller knife to saw through remaining connected parts of the lid. Cover your hand with a towel or your sleeve before prying off the lid. This will protect your hand from getting scratched by the lid.  

place the can on a stable surface.  position the tip of the knife against the inner edge of the lid.  lightly smack the back of your hand.  scoot the knife over and make a new hole.  continue until you've punctured holes around the edge of the can.  pry off the lid. 

 This ratio is determined by figuring out who is looking at the other person’s eyes more, and who is looking away more.   Your visual dominance ratio helps determine where you stand on social dominance hierarchy compared to the other person in the conversation. People who spend most of the time looking away have a relatively low amount of social dominance. People who are less likely to look away are probably the boss. People who look downward display helplessness because they seem like they are trying to avoid criticism or any conflict.  The eyes are the windows to the soul, as the cliché goes. You can learn a lot about a person by paying attention to how they use their eyes.   Avoiding eye contact at all, or looking downward with the eyes a lot, are both indications of defensiveness. Eye contact will be more continuous if a person is trying to listen to you, rather than speak. Looking away from the other person can also be an indication the person doing the speaking isn’t ready to stop and listen yet. Looking at a person can be an indication of attraction. People who are interested in someone show strong eye contact and lean forward toward the other person in the conversation. Depending on the context, making eye contact with another person can be used to show respect. For example, when you’re giving a presentation to a room full of people, divide the room into thirds. Address comments to one side, and then the other side, and then the middle. Pick out a person in each section to address comments to. The people who are sitting around them will think you are having direct contact with them, and this will make them rate you higher as a speaker. , Pay close attention to facial expressions that convey emotion, especially if they conflict with the words a person is uttering. They can help you figure out a person’s true emotions.   Regulators are facial expressions that provide feedback during conversations, such as nodding the head, and expressions of interest or boredom. Regulators allow the other person to assess level of interest or agreement. Essentially, they provide feedback. You can show empathy towards another person by using affirmative movements, such as nodding your head and smiling. These gestures, used when another person is speaking, give them positive reinforcement and show you like what they are saying.  Certain body language gestures, including facial expressions, communicate defensiveness, not confidence. Thus, they make you seem less in control.   Limited facial expressions and small, close to the body hand/arm gestures are indications of defensiveness. Turning the body away from the other person or crossing your arms in front of your body are other indications of defensiveness. , If you are giving a presentation, you want people to be engaged. If you are the person watching the presentation, you want to seem engaged. There are signs you can look for that indicate engagement or a lack thereof.   Heads tilted downward and eyes gazing elsewhere indicate disengagement. Slumping in a chair is a sign of disengagement. Similarly, fiddling, doodling, or writing, are signs that a person is disengaged.  

figure out the “visual dominance ratio.” when you are talking to someone, you should try to be the person who is “visually dominant” to demonstrate confidence.  use eye contact to send messages.  understand affect displays.  avoid defensiveness.  watch for disengagement. 

 This is just temporary and not necessary, but you may want to trap your snow golem so you can do shear him more easily. A 5x5 area should suffice.   Make sure you build this is the right biome; snow golems will melt in biomes with a temperature greater than 1.0, or dry/warm biomes ; , Do this by placing two snow blocks on top of each other, and then a pumpkin on top of that. After placing the pumpkin, the snowman will come to life. ,, It may take some tries to get it right, but you'll see when you succeed.  

fence off an area.  build the snow golem.  get some shears ready and hold them.  ,  approach the snow golem with the shears in your hand.  ,  shear the golem.

 Magicians, like other performers, tend to stick to a consistent persona that entertains their audiences. The magic tricks are enhanced by the magician's personality and delivery. Figure out what type of performer you are, and start using your strongest personality traits to your advantage.   If you're naturally funny, add some clownish comic relief to your magic show. You might want to concentrate on tricks that involve physical comedy, like disappearing acts, pulling great lengths of scarves out of your sleeve, pulling a rabbit out of a hat, and so on. If you're smart and slick, consider taking on a grifter's persona. Learn how to pickpocket a wallet and present it to the shocked audience member. Perform casino-style card tricks with a knowing smirk. Some magicians have an air of mystery that completely enraptures the audience. If this is you, perform your tricks quietly and adeptly. Incorporate tricks that make you appear to have psychic abilities.  When magicians perform, they tie their tricks together with what they call "patter," the stories and chatter that distract the audience from their hands and make the transition from trick to trick more entertaining. Without patter, a magic show would be a quiet, rather boring series of tricks without context.   Consider writing out a script and memorizing it. Rather than just winging it during your show, you might want to practice with scripted patter first. Just make sure it sounds natural by the time you perform. Speak clearly and make eye contact. Follow the same rules that apply to other types of performance and public speaking. Exuding confidence and charisma will make your show that much more entertaining.  Start with a trick that instantly captures your audience's attention and showcases your skill. Don't do similar tricks within the same show; the audience will get bored. End with your best, most flashy and exciting trick, then bow and leave the stage., You can practice all you want in front of the mirror at home, but to craft a great show, you've got to test it out in public. During your first few gigs, pay attention to the audience's reaction to your tricks. Which ones elicit oohs and aahs? Which ones seem to fall flat? Tweak your program as needed and keep trying until you're happy with your program and performance.  

choose a persona.  perfect your "patter.",  craft your program carefully.  perform in public.

 Prepare a 13-inch by 18-inch by 1-inch (33-cm by 46-cm by 2.5-cm) baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper.   Note that the modern version of this recipe does not use banana leaves like the traditional version uses.  In a large mixing bowl, combine the coconut milk, condensed milk, and melted butter using an electric mixer.Note that as you beat the ingredients together, in this step and in later steps, you should periodically scrape the sides of the bowl with a spatula to ensure that all of the ingredients are being mixed into the batter equally.  Add the eggs to the batter one at a time, beating after each addition until combined.  Mix these coconut strings into the batter one can at a time. Beat after each addition to combine.   Do not drain the syrup from the cans of macapuno. You should add the entire contents of the cans, syrup, coconut strings, and all.  Add the rice flour to the batter in 1/2 cup (125 ml) amounts, beating well after each addition to combine.   Do not add the mochiko flour all at once. If you do, the batter will become very clumpy, and you might not be able to smooth it out again even after prolonged beating.  Pour in the brown sugar and finely chopped almonds, then beat into an even consistency. When done, add the vanilla extract, and beat quickly to mix it into the rest of the batter.  Quickly inspect it to make sure that there are no air bubbles or lumps.   If you notice any air bubbles, remove them by gently tapping the bottom of the pan against the counter.  Bake the cake for roughly 45 minutes, or until it turns a light brown. Sprinkle a little cinnamon over the cake in an even pattern, then continue to bake it for another 2 to 15 minutes, or until it turns golden brown.   The center of the cake should be set when it is ready to come out of the oven. Check the center by inserting a toothpick directly into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, the cake is ready.  Remove the cake from the oven. Lift the parchment paper off the baking sheet, lifting the cake with it, and allow the cake to cool on the parchment paper but off the baking sheet until it reaches room temperature. Cut the entire thing into 2-inch (5-cm) squares and serve.   To make the cutting process easier, use a long, clean ruler and a pizza cutter. You can store the cooked bibingka in an airtight container for 1 to 2 days at room temperature. If refrigerated, you can store it for 1 to 2 weeks. The consistency of this version tends to get harder once the cake has completely cooled, so you might want to reheat it in the microwave for 20 to 30 seconds before enjoying.  

preheat the oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit (190 degrees celsius).  combine the milks.  add the eggs.  add the macapuno strings.  gradually add the sweet rice flour.  add the remaining ingredients.  pour the batter into the prepared baking sheet.  cook until done.  cool and serve the cake. 

 To build this toy gun, you will need a wooden 2x4 length of board, a saw, black tape, sandpaper, a drill and screws.; , Start with a 2x4 piece of wood about 60 centimeter (23.6 in) long. Cut the board into two pieces, one 40 centimeter (15.7 in) and the other 20 centimeter (7.9 in) long. Place the longer board in a vice.  Place the hole in the center of the plank about 9 centimeter (3.5 in) away from one end of the board.  You should wrap tape around the board from the opposite end of the hole to just before you reach the hole. Make sure the hole is still exposed.  Place the longer board over the smaller, making sure the hole is on top. The boards should be positioned to form a right angle. Just envision the longer board as the barrel and the shorter board as the stock of a gun.  Using your drill, attach a small screw though the previously-drilled hole and into the shorter board underneath. Be sure the head of the screw is larger than the hole so it doesn't slip through.  You can either sand the "stock" of the toy gun, wrap it with black tape or leave it as it is. Feel free to add further decoration with paint or markers. If your child likes playing cowboys or armies, this would be a great birthday or Christmas present.   You can make the gun a more realistic toy by adding a "trigger." Glue a wooden clothespin under the "barrel" of the toy gun, making sure that the shorter "clip" end is pointed outward. Later, your child can even stretch a rubber band from the clothes pin to the end of the gun's "barrel," releasing and "shooting" the rubber band by opening the clothespin "trigger." 

set up your workstation.  saw the board into two pieces.  drill a 2 centimeter (0.8 in) hole in the wood.  wrap black tape around the board.  connect the two boards.  screw the boards together.  finish the toy. 

 Ensure your nails are healthy by getting into the habit of rubbing cuticle oil on them regularly and pushing back your cuticles with a cuticle pusher. This will make your nails strong and stop them from breaking., Use nail clippers to trim your fingernails to even lengths and a nail file to smooth them out before you apply your design. You can choose your nail shape, such as rounded or square-shaped, but a rounded nail matches the shape of a ladybug best., Before you apply nail polish, use a cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover to remove any existing nail polish left on your fingernails. It's important to start with a clean, fresh canvas which makes the nail polish stay on better., Using a base coat allows the nail polish to stay in place. Skipping this step can lead to chipped nails early on., Using a bright red polish, brush three thin layers of red nail polish onto each nail so that the color looks opaque. Avoid painting thick coats as they will dry very slowly. Wait until each layer of nail polish dries before starting on a new coat.You can also use other bright colors as the base coat if you don't like the classic ladybug red.  Use either a nail art pen or a thin brush to paint a long stripe across the center of your fingernails. To avoid smudges, first, apply two strips of thin nail tape to the outside edges of where you want your line to go. Then, carefully apply the polish in between these lines with your nail art pen or brush, and pull off the nail tape while the paint is still wet., Place the guides at the ends of your nail so the curve points down and the end of your nail is visible above the guide. Do not do this until your nails have completely dried, as it could tear the polish underneath.  Keep the tip guide on as you paint so when you remove it, you will have an even line. Remove the tip guide while the black polish is still wet to ensure that it doesn't stick to your nail.  Use a dotting tool, toothpick, or the tip of a bobby pin to paint three black dots on either side of the black line. Spread the dots out by arranging them in a triangle formation.  Apply two white dots on the black tip of your fingernail, one on either side. You can even add a black pupil in the middle if you're going for a more animated look., Keep your stylish ladybug design intact by adding a clear top coat. Wait for your nails to dry before applying the final coat — you wouldn't want to ruin your pretty design by applying the top coat too soon. Try using a quick-drying top coat polish which will help your nails dry faster.  Set your blow dryer to "cool" to dry your nails. The thin layers of nail polish you applied earlier on will ensure a quicker drying process. Funny enough, you can also try sticking your hands in the freezer for a few minutes to freeze your nail polish dry!, When you're done, try not to use any hot water for about 12 hours, which is about how long it takes for your nails to completely set. Try to finish any chores such as laundry and dishes before you paint your nails so the design lasts., If you want your nails to last longer and keep that glossy shine, add another top coat a couple days after your mani. You'll be glad you did!

 One of the single most important things to help you prepare for the MBE is to practice, practice, practice. And the only way to do that is to get practice questions. You can do this by purchasing commercial books and/or finding an online review program that has practice questions. Or, you can purchase them online on the National Conference of Bar Examiners website.; , Treat it like the real thing so you can time yourself.  Even if you get a question right on a practice test, read why it was right and why the other choices were wrong. If you got it wrong, read the right answer explanation and the wrong answer choices explanations.  The answer choices are short, memorizing will go a long way.  If your jurisdiction has a lot of distinctions (i.e, New York) it is easy to get confused. Make sure to highlight or find another way to clearly indicate what rules apply to what.  Although by making them you can word things how you want, it might not be the most efficient use of time. , Did I say that, well good, then go practice. 

get access to a lot of practice mbe questions.  take practice tests.  review what you got right, and wrong.  review the black letter law.  keep your outlines separate.  make or buy flashcards: flashcards can make it simple to remember the black letter law.  learn what you are good at: if you find that you are stronger in one area then keep focusing on it, don't spend too much time on your weaker areas.  ,  practice, practice, practice.  answer everything, on practice tests and the real thing: you are going to get scaled out of the all 190 (remember there are 10 pretest questions), so leaving an answer choice blank won't help.  

 Your pharmacy may not be able to substitute a generic prescription if your prescription is written for the brand-name version. Ask your doctor to write a prescription for the generic version, such as Adrenaclick.Keep in mind that your doctor may not have heard of the generic version, so you'll have to play the role of educator. Bring information from a reputable website if you need to.; , In some states, pharmacies can switch to the generic version without a new prescription from your doctor. If you already have a prescription for an EpiPen, ask your pharmacist if you can switch over., You can find coupons for the generic versions of EpiPen, such as on websites like GoodRx. They can reduce the overall costs of your medication, making it more affordable. Websites like http://www.goodrx.com/ have search engines where you can search for coupons for this medication., The company that owns EpiPen, Mylan, has offered a savings card for those who need the drug. The savings card offers about $300 off on a two pack, and you can use those savings whether you are paying full price (because it's not covered by your insurance) or whether it's partially covered by insurance.You can get the savings card on Mylan's website. Some exceptions apply to this savings card. For instance, people covered by state insurance, such as the healthcare exchange or Medicare, are not eligible for this savings. You also can't use it if you don't have insurance at all.

 Place a large pot on your camping stove, and add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil. Allow the oil to heat on medium-high until it begins to shimmer, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes., Once the oil is heated, add 1 small, minced onion to the pot. Let the onion cook until it is translucent, which should take 1 to 3 minutes., When the onion is translucent, add ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of garlic powder to the mixture. Stir well, and let the mixture cook until it is fragrant, which should take approximately 1 minute.If you prefer, you can use 2 minced cloves of garlic in place of the garlic powder.  After the mixture has become fragrant, add a 14.5-ounce (411 g) can of diced tomatoes, a 14.5-ounce (411 g) can of chicken broth, ½ tablespoon (1 g) of dried basil, 1 tablespoon (6 g) of Italian seasoning, and ½ pound (227 g) of pasta to the pot. Mix well to ensure that all of the ingredients are combined.You can use any type of pasta that you like for the dish. Don’t worry if the liquid doesn’t cover the pasta completely right away. As it cooks, the sauce will thicken and cover the pasta.  Once the ingredients are mixed, place the lid on the pot. Allow the mixture to come to a boil, which should take 10 to 15 minutes., When the mixture has come to a boil, take the lid off the pot. Continue to cook the mixture until the pasta is tender but still has some bite.The best way to determine if the pasta is done cooking is to taste it and see if you are happy with the texture.  Once the pasta is finished cooking, spoon the pasta into two bowls. Top the bowls with a handful of parmesan cheese and fresh basil, and serve while it’s still warm. 

heat the olive oil in the pot.  saute the onions until translucent.  mix in the garlic powder and cook until the mixture is fragrant.  stir in the tomatoes, broth, basil, italian seasoning, and pasta.  cover the pot and allow it to come to a boil.  remove the lid and cook the pasta until it’s al dente.  divide the pasta between two bowls and top with cheese and basil. 

 The Snowflake method is often used to structure novels, but it can be used to structure short stories too. This method allows you to work through the plot of your story in increments and structure the scenes required for your story in a spreadsheet. To get started with this method, you will need to come up with a one sentence summary of your story. It should sell your story and highlight the big picture.Keep the summary short and sweet, using non-specific descriptions and terms with no names. Try to use 15 words or less and focus on tying a larger theme with character actions. For example, your one line summary might read: “A seemingly perfect marriage is disrupted when the wife disappears.”  , Once you have your one line summary, you should expand it to a full paragraph that describes the story set up, the major events, the climax, and the ending of the story. You can use the structure of “three disasters plus an ending” where three bad things occur in the story and build up to the climax of the story. The idea is that things only get worse and worse for the protagonist until they reach the climax and then the ending or resolution of the story.Your paragraph will be made up of five sentences. One sentence should describe the story set up. There should be one sentence for each of the three disasters. Then, one final sentence that describes the ending. Your paragraph may read: “Nick and Amy have a seemingly perfect marriage and appear happy to those who know them. But one night Amy disappears under mysterious circumstances and foul play is suspected. Nick is soon accused of her murder and must defend himself in court. Nick discovers that Amy faked her own murder and is still alive, but determined to put him in prison. Nick confronts Amy and they argue, but ultimately, Amy blackmails Nick into staying in the marriage.”  , Once you have your summary, you should focus on fleshing out your characters. Create a storyline for each of your main characters, noting important characteristics like the character’s name, the character’s motivation, the character’s goal, the character’s conflict, and the character’s epiphany. Each character’s storyline should be about one paragraph long.Your character synopses do not need to be perfect or polished. You will likely go back and tweak them later or deviate from them when you start writing scenes of the novel. But at least the synopses will help you get a better sense of your characters and where they fit within your story. An example character synopsis might be: “Nick is a thirty five year old reporter who is laid off from his job after ten years in the business. He has been married to Amy for ten years and views her as his golden bride, his ideal wife and partner. He struggles with his lack of employment, especially because Amy comes from a wealthy family and has recently inherited a large sum of money. He believes he needs to be the provider in the marriage and is threatened by Amy’s financial independence and success in her career. When Amy disappears, he is conflicted by his need to find her and his unhappiness in his marriage to her. He eventually realizes that Amy has set him up and is trying to frame him for her disappearance.”  , Once you have written character synopses for each of your main characters and have your one paragraph summary, you should try to expand your summary into scenes using your characters. The list of scenes will help you get a better sense of the overall plot of the story.   Use a spreadsheet program to organize the scenes, as this will make it easy to write out each scene in order. Depending on how long your story is, you may have 50 scenes or over 100 scenes. Create two columns in the spreadsheet, one for the POV character in the scene and another column to explain briefly what happens in the scene. Then, list the scenes one by one, using your summary as a guide. For example, one entry might read: “Nick discovers Amy is missing. POV character: Nick. What happens: Nick comes home for a long night working at the bar and finds the front door has been kicked open. He also finds a pool of blood in the hallway and signs of a struggle in the living room, with turned over chairs and scratches on the walls. He searches the rest of the house but finds no sign of Amy.” Continue to do this, creating scenes that correspond to your plot summary. You should then have an outline of your plot and a list of scenes that correspond to your plot. This should make it easier to then put the scenes together and form a cohesive story.  

write a one sentence summary.  create a one paragraph summary.  create character synopses.  make a spreadsheet of scenes. 

 Heating the outdoors requires a lot of power and the heater must have a powerful fan to be able to spread the warmth evenly and consistently across a wide area. The marquee has no insulation at all, so providing an even temperature across the marquee is dependent on the fans constantly working at a high rate. As such, the types of heaters that are not suitable include halogen heaters, patio heaters, cabinet heaters and table heaters, because none of these have internal fans.   Do not use anything that runs cords across where people will be sitting, standing and walking in the marquee. That's a tripping hazard waiting to happen.; , The best type of heaters for marquees are indirect heaters that are placed outside the marquee, and are powered either by gas or diesel, with ducting that sends the warm air inside.  Do not try to buy these heaters––this type of heater can be prohibitively expensive to buy. Instead, find a company that specializes in these heaters and hire them. The benefit of doing this is that you'll have the company's experts set it up and take care of it, and you won't have to worry about the heating during the event.  This will be helpful for evenly distributing the air at all sides of the marquee but you will need to pay particular attention to where you position these heaters:   The heaters will need to be relatively close to the main seating or gathering areas. The heaters must be pointed towards any entrances where heat will be lost.   Both of these positions will help to maintain a more even temperature throughout the marquee.  That will save on costs and avoid overheating or over-drying the air in the marquee. Obviously, for the deep cold of winter, you won't be turning the heaters off but you may find it optimal in other seasons to vary the usage of the heaters. Consider the following as good ways to provide heating in the marquee as per the season:   In cold seasons: You will need heaters on throughout the event, and perhaps for a period before guests arrive, to warm the marquee sufficiently.        In the late spring, summer and early autumn: You may be able to heat the marquee at the beginning of the event, turn it off for a while, and then if the event runs into the evening, you can switch it back on again later in the day when the temperatures drop.  Test it at a similar time of day to when the function is taking place, so that you can work out how long the space takes to heat up to a comfortable temperature. Or, ask for the recommendation of the hire company as to how long the heating is required to warm the marquee sufficiently., If you are heating an outdoor space, again an indirect heater may be a suitable solution. If, however, you are only hosting a small summer event, such as a patio barbecue, you may find that several small outdoor gas patio heaters offer enough heating for seated guests, which will cost you less and provide sufficient comfort for the guests. 

know which heaters will not be suitable.  choose fans that can operate from the outside, directing the heat inward.  consider hiring several smaller heaters rather than one large one.  try to keep the heating to the minimum amount needed according to the season.  test the heating before the event.  consider the size and location of the event. 

 Playing fetch, a classic game loved by most dogs, employs your dog’s natural instinct to chase and retrieve. While keeping your Rhodesian Ridgeback active is important, it is also important to keep it engaged and mentally stimulated; when bored, this breed can get into trouble (e.g. digging up plants or trees in the backyard). Use one of your dog’s favorite toys to play fetch with, like a rubber ball or squeak toy.  For a fun game that will keep your dog active indoors, try setting up blanket hurdles. Clear as much space as you can in the living room, basement, or other venue and create a small obstacle course with rolled up blankets or other safe objects (e.g. plastic toys, pillows). Walk your dog through the course a few times until it is familiar with it, then have it run through the course from one side of the room to the other.Once your dog gets used to the course, add a few blankets or pillows to increase the challenge.  While soccer may sound like an odd choice of game to play with your dog, it is an excellent activity to try with your Rhodesian Ridgeback. Use a large sized rubber ball that will be difficult for your dog to pick up with its mouth; avoid any balls that will be easy to puncture or deflate. To play, kick the ball and let your dog chase it; let him play for it for a minute once he catches up to it, then gently take it back and kick it again.To make the ball more desirable, try smearing a dab of peanut butter on it.  Tag is an excellent game to play with a dog who is comfortable enough with you to engage with you physically. The game is not a very structured one, but instead involves running, chasing, dodging, and being silly. Play tag in a fenced-in yard or park to ensure that your dog does not run off too far or get lost during play. 

play fetch.  set up blanket hurdles.  play soccer.  play a game of tag. 

 This is the ultimate preppy combo, and it can take a sweater from informal to professional chic. Pull a patterned sweater over a solid color button-down shirt, or vice versa. Pull the collar out from the top. It looks extra polished if you cuff the sleeves so that the button-down shirt sleeves are showing.You can even do this same trick with a sweatshirt. Instantly dress up a university or sports sweatshirt by popping it over a collared, button-down shirt. You can give this look a 90’s flair by layering a cropped sweater over a button-down shirt. Think Cher Horowitz in Clueless.; , This might be the stereotypical look worn by nerds in the movies, it’s anything but unfashionable. Victoria Beckham, a fashion guru, has been seen in sweater vests several times. Ryan Reynolds has rocked a sweater vest on the red carpet. This is a classic look that instantly makes you look polished and ready for business., When the weather starts getting colder and you’re ready to put your sleeveless dresses into storage, think again. Wearing a button-down shirt under your sleeveless dress can not only make it a bit more formal, but it can extend the amount of time you can wear it. Turn a summer dress into a fall (and maybe even winter) dress by wearing it over a long sleeved button-down shirt. 

layer your button-down under a sweater.  add a sweater vest.  wear it under a dress. 

 This method of folding perfect thirds uses nothing more than the measuring power of the human eye to find the spots where your paper folds into thirds. Despite this, it's surprisingly effective. In fact, once you've practiced it a few times, you can probably get away with using it for important correspondence.          To begin, you want to take one edge of the paper and double it up, bringing it across the top of the rest of the page. Don't make any creases yet — the edge you are about to fold should be gently rounded.  Try to line up the edge of the paper that you're holding so that it covers half of the paper that remains. The human eye is much better at judging halves than thirds, so it will be much easier to line up the paper correctly here than it would have been if you had attempted fold the paper into thirds from the beginning.          When you have the edge of the page lined up just right, crease the paper, making sure not to let the free edge move as you're making your crease.  The hard part of this method is already done. Now, all that you need to do is make the final one-third fold. Do this by taking the other edge of the paper and tucking it under the top edge so that it is snug against the inside of the crease. Make a second crease.          If you've made accurate folds, all of the edges of your paper should line up at this point. If they don't, feel free to make minor adjustments as needed.  

fold one edge of the paper over the top of the sheet.  line the edge up so that it covers half of the space.  tuck the remaining edge into the crease and fold in half. 

 You might want to camp with some people but people might call you weird or the crowds would get in the way and you can't have fun.  Mt. Shiveer or Sarepia make nice wilderness camping and they both have fires, but if you want to beach camp, Crystal Sands is your place. You might just want to camp in a secluded corner of Jamaa Township., You should roast marshmallows if you have a fire, go hiking, sing a song or two, and enjoy spending time with friends.  Wear cold weather clothing in Mt. Shiveer. If your in Sarepia Forest or other places (besides Crystal Sands) you might want to wear a pirate sword, a blanket, a feather (if you can), and shoes. At night an old hood or bunny hat along with your blanket can be quite cozy.  

go to an empty or semi full server.  choose your location.  roleplay the camping trip.  wear appropriate clothing. 

 Figure out what you (or your editor) want the column to be about. Do you want to entertain or inform? Asking yourself why you are writing a column will help you figure out what you want to write about. If you want to entertain, you might want to write about humorous topics or make a serious topic comical. Wanting to inform your audience might mean your column is more factual, educational, and serious., Unlike more traditional forms of journalism (such as news reports or articles), a column is by nature biased and opinionated. Think of a topic that you are passionate about and that you have a strong opinion on when figuring out your content. It will be a lot easier to write a column if you care about the subject.Although a column is biased, you should still have journalistic integrity and not maliciously slander anyone.  News stories come and go very quickly. When writing a column on recent events, move fast. You will want to write a column about a recent event within 24-48 hours after the event happened. Choose relevant topics that you have good perspective or advice about.   For example: if a political debate happens on a Sunday, you will want a column on your viewpoint of the debate written by Monday or Tuesday.  Choose topics for your column where you can write about people. Using real people in your column gives it a stronger impact and helps you prove your point.Writing about concepts and policies without using names does not have as much of an effect as using real names.For example: if you are writing a column on your opinions on immigration, use the story of a local immigrant in your column.  If you are writing a column for a local publication, then make sure to give issues a local point of view as much as you can. You can also use your own experiences to show you understand something from a first hand experience.   For example: if you are talking about problems in the education system, don’t be too general. Focus on the schools in your town and the problems kids in your town have faced or still face at school., Keep your column about the same general topic (politics, beauty, local issues, etc.). However, you should have variation within your theme. Your readers might get bored of your column if they feel like they are reading the same thing repeatedly.For example: if your theme is beauty you can talk about curly hair in one piece, eyeliner in another, and lipstick in another.  Don’t be afraid to write articles on personal topics. Your views are out in the open in columns. Write about topics that allow you to reveal and expose yourself. This personalization and vulnerability is what will make readers keep reading your column.For example: if you are passionate about helping the homeless population, write about your feelings on homelessness in your column. If you have five dogs, then write a piece about dogs and include information about your own experiences with dogs.  Writing a column for teenage girls is going to be lot different than writing a column for business owners. Think about your audience when writing a column and how they pertain to your topic. , There are different structures for columns. You can have a personal column about a specific subject or about a variety of subjects. You might want a column that is in the form of “question and answer,” to give advice or to educate. Informative columns can also be written in a “how to” format.Claiborne Ray writes a Q&A structured column for The New York Times on simple science topics.Maureen Dowd writes a traditionally structured column on politics for The New York Times., Don’t complicate your column with confusing and technical language. Keep your writing simple. Use short sentences and paragraphs.Start a new paragraph whenever you have a new thought, even if that means a paragraph is only a sentence or two.   Your column should be between 600 and 800 words., Journalistic writing is usually written in Associated Press (AP) Style. This style includes specific requirements for abbreviations, grammar, titles, and names. Refer to an AP Style guidebook or search online to learn the rules of AP Style when writing your column., In a column, don’t be afraid to talk about yourself as yourself. When writing your opinions, say it is your opinion. Don’t refer to yourself or quote yourself in third person (either by your name or as “the author” or “the reporter”).For example, you could write: “I find it horrific that our taxes are not being used to help more homeless people find jobs.” Don’t write: “Sara Finn, the author, was horrified to discover her taxes were not being used to help more homeless people find work.”  , A column is more personal than other types of journalism. Your language in a column does not have to be as formal. While maintaining good grammer, keep your tone casual and personal. Don’t write too formal: “Hell’s Kitchen, a neighborhood in New York City, is known for its variety of delicious restaurants.” Instead write: “As a self-proclaimed 'pasta expert,' I thought I knew good pasta. However, when I went to Hell’s Kitchen during my trip to New York, I ate fettuccine that changed my life.”  , The “lead” (or lede) is the opening section of your column. Unlike traditional new reporting, your column should have a descriptive and attention grabbing lead.For example: “It was 11 p.m. and I still had not eaten dinner. I was starving, angry, and lost in New York City. I finally found an Italian restaurant that was still open and ran inside, completely unaware that I was about to have fettuccine that would change my opinion on pasta forever.”  , Your column should not be a huge list of facts, but you should back up your statements with facts to make your opinions more concrete. Even though a column is not a news report, you still might want to conduct interviews and do online research to back up your points. You will be taken more seriously if you know what you are talking about., If you are explaining something complicated or technical, use analogies to simplify and make your point. This will help your readers understand what you are saying in your column.For example: “When trying to understand how the business was hiding their money to get out paying taxes, think of the files on your laptop. When you put files in the “trash can” they seem gone, but really they are still there and accessible if you drag them out. The CEO put his money into a “trash can,” so the government would not see it.”  , A column is the perfect time to be passionate about your point of view. Share your opinions and viewpoints loud and clear. However, you can’t just write a column of you complaining about an issue. You need to finish off your column with solutions. The audience of your column wants your opinion and they want answers. For example: “I am disappointed and disgusted by the number of homeless veterans living on our streets. Let's raise the taxes of the wealthy and use that money to help the homeless.”  

determine why you are writing a column.  write about your opinion.  choose relevant topics.  write about people.  localize and personalize your column.  stick to a theme.  write about personal topics.  gear your column towards your audience.  create a structure.  write clearly.  write in ap style.  use first person.  write the way you talk.  write an attention grabbing lead.  use facts.  use analogies to simplify your writing.  be passionate, but have a solution.

 Although exercise is a great way to support weight loss, you'll most likely also need to change how much you're eating. If you cut out about 500 calories a day you may be able to lose 1-2 pounds per week. This in combination with exercise can produce great weight loss.In general, it may be difficult to lose weight with exercise alone.

 If this person is part of your main crew or is someone with whom you’ve been very close, it’s time to expand your circle or friends. Call up someone you haven’t seen in a while and ask if she wants to hang out. Or chat with that guy you’re sort-of friends with in science class and see if he wants to catch a movie sometime.   Focusing on this one person you have feelings for can narrow your scope: it can seem like no one else exists or can make you happy. Meeting new people reminds you this is not true. Don't isolate. You may feel like you just want to be left alone, and that's okay sometimes. But spending time with other people will speed up the healing process and distract you.  Keeping busy is an important step toward redirecting your focus and not thinking about your feelings for this person. Don't give yourself time to think about it.Volunteer or get involved in a cause you are passionate about. Go to the movies, listen to up-beat music, read a good book, exercise, or dance. Start a new creative project, like writing a story, song, or poem; draw or paint a picture; learn a dance. Concentrate on your studies or work.  Laughter releases endorphins, which make you feel good and happy. Spend time with people who make you laugh, doing things you love.

 Understanding your child’s fear is essential for helping them work through it. Ask your child what in particular scares them about the water. Are they afraid of sinking? Does it make them uneasy to watch bathwater go down the drain?Many children develop a fear of the water after having a bad experience, such as accidentally getting water up their nose. Once you know where your child’s fear is coming from, you can find ways to help them cope with the particular situation that scares them. You might say, "Sweetie, I noticed that you get really jumpy during bath-time. What bothers you about taking a bath?" Your child's first response may be: "I don't know." A young child especially might not yet be able to make the connection as to why they are suddenly afraid. Allow them some time to think about it or, if you think you know the reason, it's okay ask them if you're right. You might say, "Is it because you saw your friend fall in the pool this weekend?"; , Kids need empathy and support when they’re scared of something. Listen to your child and make them feel understood. Avoid brushing off their fears or telling them that they shouldn’t be afraid.For instance, if your daughter is afraid of getting her face wet, reassure her by saying something like, “It seems like this is scary for you. Putting your face in the water feels funny, doesn’t it?” When you validate your child’s feelings, it reassures them that they can trust you.  Build your child’s confidence by setting a small goal that they can achieve easily. As they get more used to the water, set new goals that stretch their comfort zone a little bit further.Make sure you are cheering them on each step of the way.   If your child is afraid to take a bath, you may be able to begin with showers and then progress to taking a bath. Or if your child is scared to get into the pool, have them practice sitting on the edge with their legs in the water. After they’re comfortable doing that, have them climb down steps or a ladder to practice submerging themselves more. Let your child decide how quickly (or slowly) to make progress. Avoid making your child do anything they aren’t ready to do — this could make their fear worse. Remind your child that you are right there if they need you, and that you have confidence in their abilities.  Water wings and other swimming aids can be a good way to help a fearful child get used to the water. Use them to give your child a confidence boost until they’re ready to get into the pool on their own.Avoid relying on flotation devices for too long. For safety reasons, it’s important for young children to learn to swim without them. Get in the water with your child and practice without the flotation device, then give it back. Alternating in this way can help build their confidence.  Your kids pick up on your attitudes and behaviors. If you show them that you enjoy being in the water, they’ll want to imitate you. Go swimming with your child or let them see you get into the bathtub, and emphasize how much you like the water.If you dislike the water yourself, find another role model, such as a family member or swimming teacher, to help your kids feel positive about the water. Consider inviting one or two of their friends to join, which can help them view swimming as a fun activity.  

talk with your child about why they’re afraid.  take your child’s fears seriously.  set small goals and adjust them as your child progresses.  use personal flotation devices.  show your child that water can be fun. 

 You will want to take regular showers every day. This means scrubbing your body with soap and warm water, making sure to get the particular sweaty areas like underneath your arms. Shampoo your hair, and apply conditioner so that your hair is nice and soft to the touch. An older girl likes a guy that takes care of himself, and presents himself positively towards the world.After you get out of the shower, put some deodorant on. Make sure to use plenty, and rub it in pretty firm. You don't want to have sweat stains when you go talk to an older girl. You can even add some lotion to your hands to make them soft. If your hands are rough, the girl might not want you to touch her.; , If you decide you want a beard, that is fine. You will want to make sure you have enough facial hair to qualify as a beard. Small, light hairs around the face are unattractive, especially to older girls. It makes you look like you are going through puberty, rather than being a grown man. Make sure you trim the beard as well. Don't let it grow wild. Use razors and trimmers regularly to clean it up, nice and neat.The shaved look is much easier to maintain. Remember to shave using a razor and shaving cream every morning. Some girls like a little stubble, but you shouldn't grow it past that point. Older girls love a clean shaven man. Don't forget as well to trim elsewhere, besides your face. Take some of that overgrown chest hair off, and maintain the hair between your legs. This shows older girls that you care about your appearance and how you present yourself.  Older girls like to know that their guy takes care of himself, and that he wants his breath smelling nice and fresh. Brush your teeth (two minutes) twice a day, once in the morning and at night. Floss after you are done brushing in order to get rid of food stuck between your teeth. Then finish off with a mouthwash that cleans your entire mouth, and leaves it smelling fresh.Keep breath mints or chewing gum around in case you haven't brushed your teeth in a while. This will at least mask the smell, and make your breath minty fresh.  After you get out of the shower, comb your hair so it doesn't look so messy. If you would like, you can use products out on the market, like styling gels, which allow you to make different hairdos. You want to make yourself look clean cut, and mature about how you look.Remember to get a haircut on a monthly basis. Hair running down your neck and over your ears needs to be trimmed back.  You want to spray a tiny amount of your cologne onto "pulse points." These are spots where blood vessels are close to the skin. The blood creates heat, and transfers the fragrance of your cologne very well. These include under your arms, behind your knees, around your neckline, and on your wrists. However, it is very important that you do not put too much on. A lot of cologne can turn an older girl away., A lot of younger boys like to wear football or baseball jerseys. However, many older girls like to see a guy who dresses similar to themselves. If she wears belted shorts with a polo, she might be into the more "preppy" look. If she wears jeans and t-shirts all the time, she might prefer guys who sport a more relaxed look.Make sure all of your clothes are ironed. This shows the older girls that you care about the way you appear to the outside world, and that you care about yourself. You do not want to look as if you just rolled out of bed. Variations on appropriate attire are natural when it comes to individuals. There is no "perfect" wardrobe. Use your best judgement, and try your best. It never hurts to go out and pick up some new shirts/pants at a nearby store if you don't have much in your closet.  If your flirtation is in the early stages simply exchange a smile. Tell her how pretty she looks today, or compliment her on her outfit. Speak specifically about her as a person, about her laugh, her eyes, and any unique mannerisms you pick up on. Never touch her, especially at first. Look her in the eye when you are speaking to her to show your attention is fully on her., Stand up straight, and don't slouch. Never think that you can't date her. You have to think positively about your prospects. Older girls detect that level of confidence and are attracted to it. Speak smoothly instead of bumbling over your words. Crack a joke every once in a while that gets her to laugh. Keep a smile on your face, and never frown.Keep the conversation going. Always have something in the back of your mind to say when she is done speaking. You don't want any awkward silences.  Talk about mature topics such as a sports team you belong to, a book you have recently read, or something you know someone her age would find interesting. Ask her where she works, what sports she plays, what college she plans on going to, and where her family is from. These are mature questions, that show that you sincerely care about getting to know her as a person, rather than as a sexual object., If she is in a debate team, for example, joining the team will get her to notice and consider you. This especially works when the girl knows that it is out of your comfort zone. For example, join the book club she is in, even if you don't like to read that much. This shows that you are willing to work in order to ask her out in the future. You not only care about what you are interested in, but what she likes as well., She can be saying nice things, but her eyes might wander off. You will want to hold her attention by the way you look, the forcefulness of your tone, or your overall endearing personality. If she just doesn't seem that interested, move onto someone else. To be a mature man, you have to understand that older girls know what they want. If she doesn't want to give you her number, or never texts you back, move on respectfully.If her arms are crossed, or her eyes are looking away while you are talking to her, she may not be that into you. Make sure that your body is squared up with her when you talk. You want to show that your focus isn't elsewhere.  That way, you don't look like a complete outsider and it makes you look, and feel more connected with the group. If you plan on dating the girl in the future, you will have to at least get used to her friends. If she sees you can't even pretend to get along with them, she is likely not going to be interested. Mature men however usually can create bonds of friendship with her friends. Those friends make her happy and that should make you happy.  This is a sure way to prove you're more mature than you look and that's a good thing. Besides, dating is a major part of the road to her becoming your girlfriend. Ask her for her phone number first so that you can contact her after school hours. However, always ask her out in person, never by text or call. Older girls do not like guys who feel intimidated in their presence. Set up a clear date a time so that you do not forget.For example, a good way to ask her out is: "Hey , I was thinking about going to dinner Friday night and wanted to know if you would like to come with?"  , The classic date is to spend a nice meal together with her. Pick her up in your car and drive her to the restaurant. Open the doors for her. This is a great moment to ask her questions, and have lively conversation. Look at her eyes as you are speaking and listening. Compliment her on that nice dress she is wearing.   Do not go out to places like movie theaters until at least your second date. For a first date you aren't looking at each other, and there isn't a chance to talk to one another. When it comes to later dates, movies can be fun experiences and give you guys something to talk about. Bring her some flowers right when you walk up to her at the door. It's a great kick-starter, and will start your date out tremendously.  First dates are usually never times to inquire about sex. However, you should hold her hand, perhaps during dinner, or the car ride back home. An older girl may make the first move herself, but you want to exude confidence. After you get her back home, walk her to her front door. Kiss her on the lips good night. As you are kissing her, move your hand behind her head.A first kiss good night should only last about 5-6 seconds. You do not want to make the situation awkward, or make her feel as if you want more. Do not simply peck her on the lips or cheek. Use a little bit of tongue and show that you feel something for her. She will want more, and will be more open to dates in the future.  Know that an older girl may be further along sexually, and she may have had more experience in this area than you. Decide upon your level of intimacy as you get to know her better. If you are not ready for further advancement, be upfront about it. If you are willing, go with the flow. Listen to her needs, and feel free to express your desires.Remember that older girls are mature, and will want to practice safe sex. Always have a condom ready in case the moment is right. Open, honest relationships are built on a good sex life. If you can't be happy here, the relationship probably isn't going anywhere. Spend time before and after sex teasing and cuddling. This gets the other partner in the mood, and shows you that you are mature.  While the differential will always there, it is best not to stress over it. In the end, age differences do not mean very much. Relax, get to know her, and pursue the relationship like you would any other. Don;t listen to other people who don't understand the relationship you have., A mature man is there at all points for his girlfriend. That means when she is happy, laughing, and when she is sad, and unstable. Prove to the older girl that you are mature, and won't walk out on her. Continue to buy her flowers, bring her chocolate, and buy her cards. It can be a bit cliche at times, but it actually works. Every day that you are away, make sure you tell her that you love her.  

clean yourself up.  decide on a bearded, or shaved look.  brush your teeth regularly.  comb your hair and keep it neat.  apply cologne or body spray.  select a stylish, and fresh wardrobe.  act maturely when you flirt with her.  be confident as you talk with her.  learn what interests her.  join an activity that she is in.  read her body language, not necessarily her words.  make friends with some of her friends.  don't be afraid to ask her out.  take her out to a nice restaurant.  begin moves towards physical contact.  prepare yourself for deeper levels of intimacy.  don't stress over the age difference.  continue to remind your girlfriend you love her. 

 It is easier to do a handstand in shallow water, but you want the water to be shallow enough that your legs & feet will be up in the air. If you try to do a handstand in water that is too deep, you may have a problem keeping your hands planted on the bottom of the pool or body of water.   Be sure that nobody is close to you. In case you tip over, you don't want to accidentally kick anyone in the face. Try moving into deeper water if you find it difficult to do a handstand. This will make your body feel lighter.; , The longer you can hold your breath, the more time you will have to practice your handstands while underwater. You may want to practice holding your breath a few times before diving into the pool or lake.  Sometimes it is easier to kick one of your feet off the pool.  When you plant your hands, be sure to keep them at least shoulder length apart. The farther apart you can plant your hands, the more stable you will be.   Aim to plant your hands where your feet started, this will help get all of your weight directly above you. Try spreading your arms out a bit more if you are having problems performing a handstand. The same with your fingers. The wider your can spread them when you plant your hands, the more stable of a base you will create.  Keeping your hands firmly planted, untuck your legs from your torso and begin extending them up toward the sky.   For some people, it is easier to gain their balance if they straighten their bodies quickly.  If you have difficulty holding your legs and feet together, try crossing your legs at the ankles.   Try to keep your spine straight, directly inline with your legs. Remember to keep your legs straight. The straighter and closer together you can keep them, the easier it will be to maintain a handstand.  Pointing your toes up to the sky will help you keep your legs straight, and will also help you maintain your balance.  Remember to keep your legs together and your toes pointed. Once you're upside-down, keep your neck & head straight, looking forward, rather than looking at the bottom of the pool. This will keep your body straighter, and make it easier to maintain your balance.   Try to imagine that you are not only standing on your hands, but that you are trying to push yourself upward with every muscle of your body. Extending your muscles will help you gain your balance.  

stand in shallow water.  take a deep breath.  dive straight down while tucking your legs to your chest.  plant your hands.  straighten your body and legs.  hold your legs and feet together tightly.  point your toes high up.  hold the stand for as long as you can. 

 The pack concept is more than a century old, but most modern behavioral scientists argue that the term simplifies dog social dynamics. In the past, the pack was thought of as a militaristic hierarchy defined by dominance and aggression. Nowadays, professional trainers and behavioral researchers advocate a more complex understanding of how dogs interact with humans and each other.Since dogs and humans have evolved together for many thousands of years, dog social structures are more comparable to those of humans than they are to wolves and other animals.Given these advancements in research, rewards-based training routines based on positive reinforcement are generally preferred over training based on dominance and punishment.; , Focus on how you, your pets, and other members of your household form a particular family. Where a pack might be based on elements of survival, like hunting, you and your dog’s family involves more complicated inter-species interactions.In terms of training, stressing “pack” over “family” often involves force, intimidation, and similar techniques that have fallen out of favor among professional dog behaviorists. To understand dog social dynamics and offer your dog the most effective training, it’s important to consider specifics, including your dog’s personality, history, and breed or breed mix. When training or socializing your dog put nuances, such as whether your dog has a history of neglect or anxiety, ahead of trying to be the authoritative alpha., Even if dogs and humans have co-evolved for millennia, they are nonetheless different species. Your dog can understand that you’re not a dog, and that you’re not just animals hunting and living in a pack. Therefore, you should think of your “pack” in more complicated terms, especially when training and socializing your dog.Recent behavioral research has shown that your dog isn’t trying to be a “pack alpha” when it misbehaves. Rather, it’s either responding negatively to situations it associates with stress or acting in ways it thinks will result in rewards, like food or attention. 

learn about the origins of the pack concept.  understand the differences between “pack” and “family.” by focusing too much on the idea of a pack, you might risk overlooking important specific factors.  remember that your dogs know you’re not a dog. 

 It is ok to break the rules once in a while. One little mark is not going to tarnish the reputation your teacher has of you. If anything, it makes you seem more human and relatable to your peers.Don’t be afraid to whisper to your friend, pass a note, or make a joke during class. As long as you don’t make a habit out of it, and keep it moderation, you should be fine.  A tell-tale sign that you are a teacher’s pet is if your only friend is the teacher. This isn’t necessarily bad, but it can be lonely at times. Try to branch out and befriend other students. Make friends with students whom you have things in common with. Perhaps you love to eat chocolate, read books, or love the Christmas season. These are pretty common things that you can use to connect with other people.Revealing tiny secrets that are slightly embarrassing is a good way to deepen a friendship. By sharing intimate details about yourself, you are showing the other person that you are human, and thus, relatable.  A great student is a student that is motivated, and you can be motivated without being teacher’s pet. Instead of channeling your energy into pleasing the teacher (we know it takes a lot of energy and time), channel your energy into your interests.For example, try starting a photography, book, fashion club, or any kind of club at school. If you like planning events, you can help plan school events, like pep rallies, Christmas parties, and field days, for example.  

break the rules.  make friends.  be motivated. 

 To be clear, virtually any complex fraction can be simplified by reducing its numerator and denominator to single fractions and multiplying the numerator by the inverse of the denominator. Complex fractions containing variables are no exception, though, the more complicated the variable expressions in the complex fraction are, the more difficult and time-consuming it is to use inverse multiplication. For "easy" complex fractions containing variables, inverse multiplication is a good choice, but complex fractions with multiple variable terms in the numerator and denominator may be easier to simplify with the alternate method described below.   For example, (1/x)/(x/6) is easy to simplify with inverse multiplication. 1/x × 6/x = 6/x2. Here, there is no need to use an alternate method. However, (((1)/(x+3)) + x - 10)/(x +4 +((1)/(x - 5))) is more difficult to simplify with inverse multiplication. Reducing the numerator and denominator of this complex fraction to single fractions, inverse multiplying, and reducing the result to simplest terms is likely to be a complicated process. In this case, the alternate method below may be easier.  The first step in this alternate method of simplification is to find the LCD of all the fractional terms in the complex fraction - both in its numerator and in its denominator. Usually, if one or more of the fractional terms have variables in their denominators, their LCD is just the product of their denominators.   This is easier to understand with an example. Let's try to simplify the complex fraction we mentioned above, (((1)/(x+3)) + x - 10)/(x +4 +((1)/(x - 5))). The fractional terms in this complex fraction are (1)/(x+3) and (1)/(x-5). The common denominator of these two fractions is the product of their denominators: (x+3)(x-5).  Next, we'll need to multiply the terms in our complex fraction by the LCD of its fractional terms. In other words, we'll multiply the entire complex fraction by (LCD)/(LCD). We can do this freely because (LCD)/(LCD) is equal to 1. First, multiply the numerator on its own.   In our example, we would multiply our complex fraction, (((1)/(x+3)) + x - 10)/(x +4 +((1)/(x - 5))), by ((x+3)(x-5))/((x+3)(x-5)). We'll have to multiply through the numerator and denominator of the complex fraction, multiplying each term by (x+3)(x-5).  First, let's multiply the numerator: (((1)/(x+3)) + x - 10) × (x+3)(x-5)  = (((x+3)(x-5)/(x+3)) + x((x+3)(x-5)) - 10((x+3)(x-5)) = (x-5) + (x(x2 - 2x - 15)) - (10(x2 - 2x - 15)) = (x-5) + (x3 - 2x2 - 15x) - (10x2 - 20x - 150) = (x-5) + x3 - 12x2 + 5x + 150 = x3 - 12x2 + 6x + 145       , Continue multiplying the complex fraction by the LCD you found by proceeding to the denominator. Multiply through, multiplying every term by the LCD.   The denominator of our complex fraction, (((1)/(x+3)) + x - 10)/(x +4 +((1)/(x - 5))), is x +4 +((1)/(x-5)). We'll multiply this by the LCD we found, (x+3)(x-5).  (x +4 +((1)/(x - 5))) × (x+3)(x-5) = x((x+3)(x-5)) + 4((x+3)(x-5)) + (1/(x-5))(x+3)(x-5). = x(x2 - 2x - 15) + 4(x2 - 2x - 15) + ((x+3)(x-5))/(x-5) = x3 - 2x2 - 15x + 4x2 - 8x - 60 + (x+3) = x3 + 2x2 - 23x - 60 + (x+3) = x3 + 2x2 - 22x - 57     , After multiplying your fraction by your (LCD)/(LCD) expression and simplifying by combining like terms, you should be left with a simple fraction containing no fractional terms. As you may have noticed, by multiplying through by the LCD of the fractional terms in the original complex fraction, the denominators of these fractions cancel out, leaving variable terms and whole numbers in the numerator and denominator of your answer, but no fractions.   Using the numerator and denominator we found above, we can construct a fraction that's equal to our initial complex fraction but which contains no fractional terms. The numerator we obtained was x3 - 12x2 + 6x + 145 and the denominator was x3 + 2x2 - 22x - 57, so our new fraction is (x3 - 12x2 + 6x + 145)/(x3 + 2x2 - 22x - 57)   

when possible, use the inverse multiplication method above.  if inverse multiplication is impractical, start by finding the lowest common denominator of the fractional terms in the complex fraction.  multiply the numerator of the complex fraction by the lcd you just found.  multiply the denominator of the complex fraction by the lcd as you did with the numerator.  form a new, simplified fraction from the numerator and denominator you just found. 

 Modern diamond cutting is based on the optical calculations and is aimed at creating maximum brilliance as a result of dispersion. Diamond cut consists of the following parts: crown, pavilion and possibly culet. Pavilion depth and angle, crown depth and angle should be perfectly combined to achieve the right refraction of light. To deep or too shallow cutting lets light out of the gem, while its design should reflect the light back and make the diamond sparkle. There are round and fancy shapes of diamonds: pear, marquise\ navette, emerald\octagonal, oval, princess, radiant, heart, trilliant, asscher, cushion, round. Round cut is classical and the most popular. To choose the best shape you should consider fingers length and form. Small and symmetric diamonds look better on small hands with slim fingers, while Marquise and Pear would best fit short fingers.; , A diamond works like a prism dividing incoming light into the spectrum of colors. There is a scale grading diamonds colors from D to Z, with D meaning a perfectly colorless diamond, and Z - noticeable color. Colorless diamonds marked D – F allow more light to pass through them, thus, they are considered the best and are the most rare and expensive. So, the less color the diamond has the more sparkling flashes (called “fire”) it will produce. Yellow color in a diamond reduces the color spectrum like a filter. Diamonds marked Z are yellowish or even brownish.  Carat is a measure of diamonds weight, which is of course directly proportional to their size. To help you understand the proportions of carats and sizes there are multiple guide charts with relation tables available. They are adjusted for each diamond shape listed above.  Diamond clarity is the quality describing the existence of internal and surface defects of stones. These peculiarities of texture are called inclusions and blemishes. Inclusions are structural imperfections, different in size, color, location, number and visibility. They can be whitish cracks or crystals of foreign materials. There is a clarity grade as well which allows assessing the presence of inclusions identified under ten times magnification.  

look at the cut and shape.  really look at the color.  determine its number of carats.  examine it for its clarity. 

 For best results, you’ll want to be able to apply the peroxide to your hair via spray bottle. Pouring it directly from the bottle over your head will leave you to guess as to how much of your hair has been affected.   Peroxide is definitely the least predictable, and likely the least optimal option available to you. It doesn’t work against the dye and chemicals already in your hair, but instead adds another one. Use it with caution.  Use the “mister” setting, if you have the option, as opposed to the “stream” setting. Spray the hair you wish to lighten from a distance of about a foot away, using a hand or cloth to cover your eyes.   Peroxide is safe to get on your skin, but can cause burning in your eyes.If you get some in them, flush them with cool water. Going outside in the sun can cause further lightening, but can also dry your hair out. Be aware of the effect sunlight will have if you choose to go outside with the peroxide in your hair. Use pins or clips to arrange your hair, so that you only spray the hair you want to.  Excessive peroxide use can easily lead to a brassy, orangey hair coloration.   A deep conditioning is recommended if your hair feels dry after the peroxide treatment. 

pour hydrogen peroxide into a spray bottle.  spray the peroxide evenly onto your hair.  rinse it out with cold water after 30 minutes.any longer risks your hair becoming overly dry, or overly bleached.  finished.  

 Groundwater is generally replenished through precipitation such as rain. Once water comes down, it soaks into the ground, creating groundwater. When you're studying, the rain is the information you try to absorb. If you don't spend time reviewing information, your soil will have nothing to absorb., As water absorbs, it doesn't usually form a pool underground (though it does sometimes sink down into an aquifer). Rather, it just soaks into the ground, saturating it. If it becomes oversaturated, it moves away into lakes and ponds instead of staying in the ground. In other words, if you try to absorb too much water (information) at once, it can flow away elsewhere, and you won't retain it., One way to make sure your soil absorbs water at a steady rate is to let it precipitate frequently. In other words, you need to revisit information frequently over a longer period to help absorb the information.It helps if you keep up with your classwork as you go along, if you're studying for a class. That way, you're not trying to learn it all right before the test.  When you're in class, it's important to pay attention to what your professor or teacher is telling you. They will often emphasize what's most important, meaning that's what you need to focus on when you do study., If you think of your brain as having a specific type of soil, you'll understand how different brains absorb information at different speeds. Some people absorb information more slowly, and they have a "clay" type soil. Clay is tightly packed, so it lets water through to the groundwater more slowly, just like people who have this type of brain.If you have a clay brain, you may find that you can't cram information in. You need to plan ahead when studying information, as you'll need to learn a little at a time. You may also need to break down processes. You may feel overwhelmed if you're looking at a complex process, but you'll find it easier to work with if you have smaller steps.  If your brain is a gravel-type soil, you absorb information more quickly, just as gravel lets through more rain to the groundwater. It can be helpful to absorb information more quickly, but on the other hand, it may lead you to think that you can put off studying.However, studies have shown that you still need to pace out your learning if you expect to retain information in the long run, as cramming the night before a test often only leads to short retention. While you may not need as much time as a clay-type learner, try to spread out what you're learning at least a week before the test.  Whether your a clay or gravel learner, you may misjudge how much time you need because you vaguely remember the material. In other words, you're familiar with it. However, just because you are familiar with it doesn't mean you will recall what you need in detail.To make sure you are retaining information, try rearranging into a form that makes sense to you. That way, you're not just trying to memorize it, you're synthesizing it as well.  One way to help your retention over time is to take notes. Taking notes reinforces the information, helping you to absorb it. Try taking notes both in class when your teacher is speaking, as well as when you're reading for class.As an added bonus, you can use your notes for review later. Don't try to take down every word. Rather, try to keep your notes short. It's best if you can put it in your own words because that means you're processing the information. Try using an outline method. Adding in indentions and a numbering system can help you organize as you go. One way to go faster is to use consistent symbols and abbreviations., If you can, use what you learn to "water" your soil. In other words, try to apply what you learn to how you live your life. For instance, if you're in an economic class, think about how economics on a national level is similar to your own personal budgeting issues., Working with other students can be beneficial. They can have a take on material that you wouldn't have thought of. If you work together, you can help each other to retain more information than if you work alone. Plus, working in a group can help keep you on track., One way to make sure you're absorbing information is to take samples of water periodically. In other words, try testing yourself on the information, particularly in the week leading up to your test. By testing yourself, you're forcing yourself to recall the information, which helps solidify it in your brain. 

increase the information or "rain" to your brain.  don't expect a pool of water or information to collect.  let it "rain" frequently to learn more.  be ready to absorb information.  work around the challenges of "clay" soil when absorbing information.  don't rely too much on quick-thinking with the "gravel" type soil.  don't think familiarity means you will recall well.  take notes.  use the "water" you absorb in your everyday life.  don't try to water your soil (absorb information) alone.  take samples of your "water" to see if your absorbing information. 

 The state of Washington has a convenient online database where you can look to see whether the state is holding property that belongs to you or someone else.   Go to: http://ucp.dor.wa.gov/. You will find spaces to enter your personal information to start the search. Put in your first and last name or your business name or a reference number if you’ve already started a claim. Click the blue search button or returning user button. Unclaimed property in Washington comes from more than just the government too. It can also come from banks, retailers, credit unions, utility companies, insurance companies, and various corporations. The Department of Revenue is the holder of the unclaimed property and, as such, administers the program in order to seek rightful owners and return the property to them.; , The state of Washington has very precise definitions for what counts as unclaimed property. Don’t waste your time looking for something that doesn’t count.   Typical unclaimed property in Washington includes such things as bank accounts, proceeds from insurance, stocks bonds or mutual funds, safe deposit box contents, utility and phone company deposits, and uncashed checks. Uncashed checks can include payroll checks, insurance payments or even traveler’s checks. Unclaimed property is defined as property being held by an organization that has not had contact with the owner for an extended period of time. Generally, it takes three years for property to be considered unclaimed. In Washington, real estate, cars, and most other physical property does not count as unclaimed property under the unclaimed property law, which is Chapter 63.29 in the state statutes., Unclaimed property laws are very specific in Washington. The power of the law protects your property until it can be returned to you.There is no time limit for filing a claim to receive it back. Owners or their heirs can file to regain property that was reported since 1955. Claims are updated once a week. You might not have received a notice from the company that owed you the money if the amount was small. The one exception to this lack of a time limit for filing is that the state might auction off the contents of safety deposit boxes that remain unclaimed for five years. There’s a lot of unclaimed property out there. More than $1 billion in unclaimed property was turned over to the Washington Department of Revenue, dating back to 1955. In 2013 alone, the department received $138 million in unclaimed property, an amount that is on the rise.  

use the state’s database.  determine the definition of unclaimed property.  know your rights. 

 If you are in doubt as to your own particular growing zone and its compatibility for growing cherries, contact your local garden center or landscaping and nursery store to explore your options.; , Some varieties may do better in certain growing zones than in others.   Select a cherry variety that is compatible with the climate in which you live. Choosing the wrong variety of cherry can result in problems such as cherry leaf spot, brown rot and fruit cracking.  The type of cherry that you decide to grow should depend on your growing zone and how much work and effort you are willing to put into growing and caring for them.   Choose a tart variety of cherry to grow if you want to use them primarily for cooking such as in preserves and pies. Tart cherries are hardier, tend to have less disease and are more tolerant of extreme temperatures. Tart cherry trees are ornamental and tend to be smaller overall in size, which makes them easier to care for through pruning and harvesting. Select a sweet variety of cherry if you want to grow them primarily for eating. Growing sweet cherries requires more time in pruning and spraying to protect against disease. The sweet cherry is also the variety that attracts birds more often so extra efforts will have to be made in protecting your cherry trees.  Choose an elevated site over 1 that is located in low areas where colder temperatures settle.   Do not plant your cherry trees in a location that has previously been used to plant tomatoes, melons, strawberries or peaches. Cherries are very susceptible to several diseases including Verticillium wilt. Provide space for your cherry trees to grow after you plant them. Allow approximately 12 feet (4 m) spacing between dwarf size cherry plants. Standard size cherry plants require twice the amount of distance between plants. Use good, rich soil as you put your cherry plants into the ground and cover the roots. In gauging the depth of the hole, it should not be too much deeper than the original container in which it was placed prior to its purchase.  Once they start to bear fruit, wait until after harvesting time to fertilize the trees.  Remember that some varieties are hardier than others.  There are several methods that you can use to protect your cherry trees.   Explore possible options including netting as well as fencing to surround the perimeters of your cherry trees. Birds can easily get caught in netting unless you use the correct gauge and drape it properly. Contact your local garden center to learn about methods to safeguard your cherry trees that will not harm nearby wildlife.  The initial cherry blossoms that flower during spring will produce a beautiful display. With proper care, your cherry trees can provide you with many years of enjoyment as well as a harvest of fresh fruit for both eating and cooking.  Cherry fruit flies, common across the united states cause cherry worms making cherries unusable. There are also organic ways to handle birds, pests and fruit flies. Another common pest after cherries are harvested are Japanese beetles.  

realize first and foremost that cherries cannot be grown in all regions of the world.  do some research to learn about the many varieties of cherries that you can grow.  know that the most common varieties are the sweet cherry and the tart cherry.  plant your cherry trees in a location that will provide sunshine, soil that is well drained and proper circulation of air.  fertilize your cherry trees annually during the spring.  follow the guidelines in watering, pruning and spraying your cherry trees based on the particular variety that you purchased.  realize that birds will be attracted to your plants and that you will need to protect them in order to enjoy the cherries and not to have the fruit eaten before it is harvested.  monitor your cherry trees as they grow.  plan to treat your cherry trees with pesticides for cherry fruit flies. 

 While proper hygiene is generally considered a preventative measure against urinary tract infections, it is also an essential part of getting rid of the infection sooner. The more you can incorporate healthy and hygienic practices, the better off you will beWipe from the front to the back after using the bathroom. This is especially important for women, who should always wipe from front to back., Sexual intercourse is one of how bacteria can be introduced into a woman’s urethra, eventually ending up in the bladder.To help prevent this, the genital and anal areas should be cleaned before and after sexual activity. Women should also urinate before and after sexual activity. Avoid body lotions and Massage oils as a lubricant unless it says it's safe. These have chemicals that can lead to an infection.   Urinating after intercourse empties the bladder and flushes out bacteria.UTIs are not infectious, and you cannot catch one from somebody else., Certain clothes can make it more difficult to get rid of your UTI. Tight-fitting underwear which is made of non-breathable materials can enable a moist and bacteria-friendly environment to develop adjacent to the bladder. For these reasons, go for cotton underwear, rather than non-absorbent fabrics like nylon.Avoid tight-fitting pants or shorts. Tight garments can cause sweat and moisture to build up, creating an ideal breeding ground for bacteria. Wearing the right underwear can help prevent infections developing or worsening, but it won’t cure them.  

maintain excellent urinary hygiene.  clean before and after sex.  wear the right clothing. 

 Mice are clever creatures that aren't easily spotted during daytime hours while people are around. You might notice a slight movement out of the corner of your eye and not even realize that what you noticed was a mouse. Next time you see a movement, take it as a sign that you should investigate further.; , It's easier to hear mice at night when the house or apartment is quiet. You may hear a light tapping or scratching that sounds like it's coming from the walls.   If you hear sounds of mice running along the walls, that's a sign that you've got more than one creature to take care of. If you hear squeaks, you may have a mouse nest full of babies on your hands.  Mouse droppings are small, dark and seed-shaped. New droppings are wet and black, and older ones will have dried out to a lighter gray color.   Note which room you see the droppings in. The presence of droppings in a room should indicate that something in the room is attractive to mice. The presence of droppings can also indicate that there's a crack or hole in the room through which mice can enter.  If you can determine the pathways the mice often use, you will be able to catch and track the mice more easily. Mice often establish runs and use the same pathways time after time. Usually the runs are not directly visible so the mouse is only visible as it traverses a few feet of open floor or counter top., Of course, it will be along the runs if you have been able to identify them. And you will probably find the nest near where you saw a concentration of droppings. Nests are usually built in the corners of cabinets or closets. Look in out-of-the-way places that don't often get disturbed.   Mice chew through cardboard boxes and items of clothing to use as materials for their nests. Look for tiny holes in the pile of clothes you've left sitting in the back of your closet. A musty smell might also indicate the presence of a mouse nest.   Mice are lured into these traps by the scent of bait placed inside it, usually peanut butter or cheese. They enter a small hole and get trapped in with the bait. Once a mouse has been caught, you can take the trap to a field or the woods and set the mouse free.  Make sure to always use surgical (or other) gloves when baiting or handling traps. Mice have an extremely good sense of smell and will not enter a trap that has been handled by humans or that smells "off," perhaps because of chemical smells or soap residue. Be aware of your handling from the time you start to unwrap the trap after your purchase and strive to not touch the trap directly with your skin, ever. This will assure best chances of trapping your target(s). Set live traps in the room where you found mouse droppings or a nest. Live traps are more expensive than other types of traps, so you might want to start by buying just one or two. If you have a bigger infestation of mice, it might not be practical to catch them with live traps, since you'll likely have to make a lot of trips to the woods to set them free.  These types of traps look like little cardboard houses. The bottom is lined with a sticky substance that attracts mice, then traps their little feet so they can't run away. Be aware that this often results in a still-living animal stuck on the trap.   Buy several sticky traps and place them around the room where you saw mouse droppings or a nest. Don't forget to put some in the cabinets and closets. Bigger sticky traps can trap more than one mouse at a time. Mice don't die right away in sticky traps, and unfortunately you may hear pained squeaks coming from the traps. You may need to humanely euthanize any living mouse that you have caught on it. Keep this in mind when you're deciding which trap to buy.  Snap traps are baited with a bit of peanut butter or cheese. When the mouse steps on the trap to eat the bait, its weight causes a wire to snap down on the mouse.   Snap traps are cheap, so you can buy a lot of them and place them wherever you think mice might be present. Place a piece of newspaper under each trap for easier cleanup. Since snap traps kill mice instantly, they're actually more humane than sticky traps. However, they can be less pleasant to deal with. Make sure to throw out snap traps as soon as mice are caught, and sanitize the area afterward.  Cats are natural predators of mice, and they are as good at catching mice as any trap. Let your house cat spend time in the room where mice are present. It shouldn't take long for your cat to take care of the problem.   Some people borrow a friend's cat for this purpose. Having a cat stroll around your property is a good mouse deterrent and may prevent them from coming inside in the first place.  Scrub every nook and cranny to get rid of mouse nests and materials that mice might want to make into nests. Throw out old boxes, bags, books, magazines and any other paper or cloth materials you might have lying around.   Sanitize any areas where you found droppings, a nest, or trapped a mouse. Don't store your possessions in cardboard boxes sitting on the floor, since mice can chew through cardboard easily. They can even chew through plastic or wood and will do so if they have a reason. For example, they smell food or think they might be able to create a secure hiding place. Clear out general clutter, especially in corners of your house or apartment that aren't frequently used.  You might not think of it as mouse food, but mice are attracted to all types of edible substances they can find on the ground, on counters and in cabinets.   If your trees drop edible nuts and berries, make sure you rake them up frequently. Clean up spilled birdseed from under the feeder a few times a week. Make sure your outdoor garbage can has a tight lid, and always keep it covered. Don't let cat or dog food sit out all day; clean it up after your pet has eaten.  Make sure all grains, nuts, and other dry goods are stored in tightly sealed plastic, glass or metal containers.   Half-used boxes or bags of food are attractive to mice, be it human food or pet food. Store the remaining food in an airtight container and recycle the box or bag. Don't leave bread or fruit sitting out on the counter for more than a day or two. If food items you leave on the counter or on top of the refrigerator become a problem, tighten up. Use a metal bread box and work out a storage method for fruits and vegetables that you do not like to refrigerate. Clean your pantry and cabinets often. Make sure crumbs, dried juice, and other stray bits of food don't sit on your kitchen floor. Remain vigilant and observe any signs of pantry raiding by the pesky critter, then provision to eliminate the opportunity for the mouse family to dine.  Make sure the gap under your door isn't providing a convenient entrance for mice. You can buy materials to seal the gap at a hardware or home and garden store.   Keep your windows closed or screened. Seal any cracks or holes you find in your walls, especially exterior walls. Steel wool is a cheap material you can stuff into crevices to deter mice.  Place a substance known to repel mice in the corners of your home and around doors, cracks, and other places mice may enter.   Peppermint and other strong oils contained in "strewing herbs" repel mice. Cut a sponge into 1" (3cm) squares and saturate each with peppermint or eucalyptus essential oil, then place these strategically around your house and kitchen. You could plant some mint around your windows and doors and use the herb in teas and in sachets to freshen your cabinets and closets. Bay leaves also repel mice. Crush them up and sprinkle them around your house, or tuck whole leaves in the corners of your pantry and cabinets. Mothballs are an effective repellent, but these are toxicand can cause problems for children and pets. Naphthalene is a pesticide and sublimates readily so you should think thrice before employing this method. Additionally, moth balls are more expensive, require replacing often when the balls sublimate, and are not as eco-friendly as herbs or herb-based essential oils. Make sure children and pets are kept away and closely monitor them for signs of a reaction to the mothballs should you decide to use them. If there are mice in your walls you can usually get rid of them by using a syringe and squirting ammonia into the wall. The fumes and smell will chase them out.

 Bundling Film: This is narrow width stretch wrap that comes in widths of 2", 3" and 5".  Bundling film is a good choice when you want to keep your firewood vented. It allows you to wrap just the ends, or both ends and the middle, and reduce the possibility of moisture becoming trapped in the wrap. Hand Stretch Film is is a wider wrap that comes in stock widths of 12", 15" and 18". With the extra width, this can allow for a quicker wrap time and will fit many firewood bundling machines and devices. All of hand wrap films comes on a standard 3" core.; , Ultimately, this is a very subjective question, but there are some guidelines that can be used.  The typical application for stretch film is holding together boxes of product on a skid weighing typically over 1000lbs, so the wrap has to be able to stretch tightly to hold the load together during the shipping and handling processes. That is not the case with firewood bundling, where the bundles are small, typically moved by hand, and weigh only a few dozen pounds at most.  For these reasons, Extreme 789 hand wrap is recommended. This hand wrap is thinner and less expensive than a traditional 80-90ga film, but has comparable strength when it comes to holding your bundles together. It has the cling you expect with a standard gauge stretch wrap and will resist the minimal puncture potential presented by firewood.   Handy Bundler is the most common type. The film comes on a 3" core and each case has one plastic plug-in handle. This is a good choice if you have one person doing the wrapping, and they do it sporadically. Best Bundler/Extended Core is a film that comes on a 1" extended core and is available only in 5" widths. The 5" of film is wound on a 10" long core, leaving a 5" long handle built-in to each roll.  The Best Bundler also ships with one red rubber grip per case, which you can use to slip over the core and reduce any wear on unprotected hands. This is a good choice if you have multiple people doing the wrapping and the wrapping is done fairly often throughout the day.   Use QuikWrap. This is for heavy use, applications, where more than one person is doing the wrapping and they are doing it for the majority of the day, so the patented QuikWrap system is the perfect choice. It's available in all widths (2", 3" and 5") and comes on a 1-3/4" core.  

know what size stretch wrap you need.  know what gauge stretch wrap you should use.  know the best tools to use, to wrap the firewood.

 Instead of trying to impose your worldview and thoughts onto other people, take time out from that need and just listen. What are others really saying? Is it so urgent to make them see things your way?; , Rather than asserting yourself as the person with all the answers, simply ask questions as part of your joining in the conversation. Ask about people's feelings, thoughts, wants, concerns, etc. and avoid overlaying your feelings, etc., in return.  This means that you become open to presenting options and reaching compromises rather than insisting that it's "your way or the highway." Find the middle way instead and the means by which your interests and the other person's interests can meet in the middle. It might mean giving up a little of something, but, in turn, you'll gain a great deal more.  Though perhaps a cliché, it's quite true. When you're trying hard to be something you feel is expected of you rather than the person you really are, you may become more bossy to cope. Try to overlook those expectations from others and be guided by your own values, wherever possible. Once you feel secure with your values, you'll feel a lot less need to push others around. You'll stop seeing others as a challenge to your identity.  Not everyone can do things at a hare's pace and not everyone is good at the things you're good at. If we were all the same, there would be no room for excelling and there would be no place for learning about diversity. Be grateful that there are differences and instead of seeing obstacles in the way others behave, look for their strengths only and work with those. This is especially important if you've fallen into a bad habit of thinking that you have no weaknesses; that sets you up for a fall. Instead, show people you know how to recognize their strengths and work with those.  Even if you do know a better way to do something, when a co-worker is reluctant to listen to your suggestions, consider that maybe they'll have to suffer the consequences of their actions and choices. If you don't, you might be enabling those around you who aren't quite as competent as you're helping them appear.  Bossy people don't have time to stop and smell the roses because everything must be "just so." Let it go now and then and just stop. Tame that perfectionism before it engulfs you!  

sit down and listen.  start joining slowly in to conversations.  adopt the mantra: "people should choose for themselves.",  be yourself.  accept difference.  know when to let others make mistakes.  enjoy life!

 Salads can be just as bad as any entrée if they are loaded with dressing. Instead, order what you want to eat with any unhealthy aspects either taken off or put on the side (if you can handle having them there without feeling like you need to eat them).  If you feel this way then remind yourself that the money you spent on the part of the meal that you didn't eat is just an investment in a healthier you or if you can take the rest of the food home and eat it later.   If you go to a restaurant and find the portions to be large, ask for a take-home box when your food arrives. Place half the meal into the box before you begin to eat. Plan on eating the rest later that day, if you get hungry, or tomorrow. This way you won't feel you've wasted money or food and you'll already have tomorrow's lunch ready to warm up.       Do a little research before you go to the restaurant. There are websites that list the ingredients/nutritional facts for restaurants.        

ordering meals that sound less unhealthy won't always guarantee that they are healthy.  never justify eating your entire meal because you paid for it.

 Before getting started, you’ll want to make sure your patio is completely clear. Find a place away from your work area to stash patio furniture, dining sets, planters, grills, toys and anything else that may be damaged by free-flowing water or cleaning solutions. Your work area should ideally be as empty as you can get it.Bring lightweight furniture inside, and move heavier pieces to the yard, sidewalk or a covered porch. Prolonged exposure to moisture can cause metal furniture and appliances to rust.; , Use a broom to dislodge as much loose debris from the patio as you can. This will make it easier to reach the more stubborn stains underneath, as well as give you an idea how extensive the cleaning methods you employ will need to be.Substances like compact dirt, dried mulch or sidewalk chalk may need to be scrubbed by hand using an abrasive sponge.  Once you’ve swept the concrete, hose it down with a heavy stream of water. Push the dirt off to an adjoining section of the yard to drain. The concrete will then need time to dry before you can move on to other, more involved methods.If it’s been awhile since you last cleaned your patio, add some mild liquid dish detergent to a bucket of warm water to make a soapy rinse. The surfactants in the soap will help break up dirt and oil more effectively.In some cases, a good hosing may be all you need to remove a thin layer of dirt and sediment.  

remove all furniture and other objects.  sweep away excess dirt.  spray the patio with a garden hose. 

 Credit sales are distinct from cash sales in that the customer is not required to make a full payment on the date of sale. Instead, they purchase their order on account and are allowed a set amount of time in which to make payments. From a business's perspective, this transaction is recorded as revenue, even though payment has not been received. In addition, the amount of the sale is added to "Accounts Receivable," an asset account that records the amount of money owed to the business by its customers.  When orders are paid for, the Accounts Receivable account is reduced for the amount of the order and cash is increased.; , The simplest method used to find total credit sales is to maintain your Accounts Receivable account and to update it for each sale made on credit. This method is most accurate as it accommodates for changing product prices as well as all cash sales. If you want a total for annual or quarterly credit sales, you can simply start recording a credit sales amount at the beginning of that period. Then, each time you update accounts receivable, you can add to the sale amount to your credit sales amount for that period.  Remember that sales tax is included in credit sales amounts., Total sales can be calculated as number of goods sold multiplied by the selling price. However, this can be complex if you offer different products at different prices. For example: If a company sold 100 unites of laptops at $100 a piece, its sales would be 100×100=$10,000{\displaystyle 100\times 100=\$10,000}.  To calculate credit sales, start by finding the cash received. Lets assume that the customers on an average paid $60 in cash for those 100 laptops, so cash received would be $6000.  Then, you can calculate credit sales by reducing total sales by total cash received. The credit sales would be equal to total sales minus cash received, which in this example is $10000−$6000=$4000{\displaystyle \$10000-\$6000=\$4000}., The initial value at the start of the year can be seen from the balance sheet of the company. Let's assume the value to be $10000. Start by finding the ending accounts receivable. It is the value at the end of the year which can also be found out from the balance sheet itself just like initial accounts receivables. Let's assume it to be $5000.  Then, determine the cash received. This should be in the company's records. Let the cash received for the year be $20000.  Finally, calculate credit sales by finding the difference. So the credit sales can be calculated as (cash received - initial accounts receivable + ending accounts receivable). In the example above, it would be $20000 - $10000 + $5000 = $15000. So the credit sales would be $15000 for the year. 

understand credit sales.  sum up individual credit sales.  calculate credit sales from total sales.  calculate credit sales from accounts receivables. 

 One reason that you might wake up with a stomach ache is that you are thirsty. Dehydration can cause a stomach ache and since you have just gone all night without water, you may be slightly dehydrated. Pour yourself a glass of water and drink it slowly. You don't want to drink it too fast and shock your empty stomach.   You can also add lemon to it as well. It can help calm any stomach irritation caused by the dehydration. You can also try to drink juice or a sports drink to help replenish any nutrients or electrolytes that you might be missing., If you wake up with pains in your stomach, you may need something to calm your stomach down. Ginger, whether it is in tea, raw, or in ginger ale, can help calm your stomach and make it feel better. It promotes the release of enzymes that help neutralize stomach acid and contains phenols that relax the stomach muscles and irritated tissues. One of the best ways to get pure ginger is by making a homemade ginger tea.   To make the tea, start with 2 inch piece of ginger root and water. Peel and cut the ginger root into small pieces, then crush the pieces into even smaller bits. Boil 2-3 cups of water and add the ginger once it's boiling. Let it boil for 3-5 minutes. Remove it from heat. You can strain the ginger out when they pour it into a mug if you want or you can leave it in and drink it along with the tea. You can also drizzle some honey in it to make it sweeter. You can simply eat ginger if you prefer that to drinking the homemade tea., Chamomile tea is a great way to soothe your stomach. The chamomile in the tea helps reduce inflammation, which can help relax the muscles in your stomach that are contributing to the ache. If you are not a fan of chamomile, you can brew most herbal teas to help with stomach issues.   Steer clear of peppermint tea. It ca relax certain parts of your esophageal sphincter, which leads to heartburn and acid reflux., Unlike normal water, coconut water contains electrolytes and natural nutrients that can help alleviate stomach pain. The water contains natural sugars that will give you calories to give you energy as well as potassium and vitamin C.   Make sure you get 100% pure coconut water.You don't want any of the artificial ingredients that may make your stomach ache even worse.  Baking soda is great for a stomach ache because it helps neutralize stomach acid, which causes pain. Many over the counter medications contain baking soda, but you can make your own home solution to ease your stomach pain. Add a tablespoon of baking soda to 1 cup of water. Stir it well and then drink it.   You can warm the water if your want, but it isn't necessary., Unlike other kinds of vinegar, apple cider vinegar is rich in nutrients that can help alleviate your stomach ache in the morning. It also has helpful bacteria and enzymes that will alleviate digestive disruption, help indigestion, and reduce cramps.   Mix apple cider vinegar with water and honey and stir. Drink it all to help alleviate your stomach ache.  

drink water.  make ginger tea.  brew chamomile tea.  try coconut water.  mix a baking soda solution.  make an apple cider vinegar drink. 

 If you are gone a couple of days, most fish should be fine without food. If you are on a month long trip, your fish will require food.; , Whenever you leave your fish to travel, there will always be risks. If you have rare and expensive fish, always make sure that you have the proper care plan laid out, and make sure it is as foolproof a plan as possible.  Different fish have different dietary needs. Be sure to know exactly what kinds of fish you have.   Carnivores require live food and/or carnivore pellets. Omnivores: A large amount of fish fall into this category. Most fish in this group could be fed a food block(bought from a local fish store). Feeder blocks work by encasing food in a block of minerals that dissolves gradually in water over several days. For omnivores with a stricter diet of pellets and dried foods, use the automatic vacation feeder as described in the carnivore section. Herbivores: These are fish with a vegetable and plant diet. If you can feed them dried seaweed or vegetables, then use the vacation feeder. If they must get fresh vegetables than it would be best to get someone to come over and feed your fish.  There are several methods of feeding fish during your absence. The length of your vacation will impact your choice but it is always a good idea to have someone check now and then, especially if the electricity goes off in your area (which only a neighbor will know about).   Get a vacation feeder and fill the compartments with the correct food for your fish. The feeder will automatically release food into the water according to a schedule that you program into it. This method is only suitable for fish that take pellet and flake like foods, as it will not hold bloodworms and other live foods. Freeze-dried bloodworms are available. Put feeder fish of varied sizes in the tank. It is key to put different sized feeder fish into the tank as the predator will eat some first, and some later, according to size. Do not put live worms into the tank as they will foul up your water. Use a feeder block. Go to your local pet store and buy a suitable feeder block for your fish. It's best to experiment with a few before you go away, as some fish will reject certain feeder blocks. Place the block into the bottom of the fish tank on the day you go away. If you are going away for a long time, organize for someone to come replace the feeder block every 5 to 7 days. Have someone come over and feed your fish. This is the best method, especially if your fish are picky eaters, but make sure that they have enough time to feed your fish, and know how, when and what to feed them.  With some fish you could place a large clump of vegetables in the tank with a weight, and they would eat it over time. Even if you don't like zucchini, it's possible your fish will.  It is possible to satisfy two of the groups, as omnivores can eat carnivore and herbivore's food. , Fish like Bichirs and spiny eels tend to crawl out of holes in your tank, so make sure there are no escape points where the fish could get out. If you have a pond and need to prepare it for the winter, now would not be the time to leave.  Ask around. Sometimes pet shops have services where you pay them to come over and feed your fish.   Unknown people have full access to your house. This makes it important that the person you choose is properly vetted or is known to you. If you do not feel comfortable with strangers in your house, ask a family member or a friend. Alternatively, a pet sitting service whose clients have been police verified can be an alternative, although more costly.  Tell them everything they need to know, especially about how much to feed, and also leave a written instruction sheet for their reference. If you can't find anyone at all to take care of your fish, it would be best not to leave. If you do, you are taking extreme risks, and it is likely your fish won't survive., You really don't need to worry about this too much. Before you go on vacation, do a water change within the week before you leave. Make sure that if you have someone coming over to feed your fish they know how much to feed, and won't pollute your water. Clean your tank again soon after you return.  Hopefully, nothing went wrong while you were gone, but check for any spikes in ammonia, nitrite, or nitrate. You may have to perform large water changes until your water is back to normal.  

plan for the length of your absence.  understand the risks.  plan according to the type of fish you have.  know your options.  provide live plants or vegetables.  combine these methods to care for a variety of fish.  still, if you have different groups of fish diets in your tank, all with their own special food, it would be best to get someone who can spend enough time to make sure each group is satisfied.  ,  cover your tank securely.  get somebody to take care of your fish.  talk to your fish-sitter about your fish before you leave.  keep the fish tank clean.  test your water when you come back.

 That is hold the bat either from the bottom of the handle (like Virender Sehwag) or from the top of the handle (like Adam Gilchrist) or anywhere so that you comfortably get a full outstretched swing of the bat.; , For aggressive batting, your stance should be strong and composed. A high back lift stance helps in improving your batting reflexes and gives extra power to the shots played.  If you move your feet towards the pitch of the ball you'll be able to transfer the weight of your back leg to the shot you'll play. This adds on as some extra power to your shots and also increases your chances of hitting the ball from the middle of the bat.  Head should be in the right position while playing shots. With a steady head you'll have more control on your shots and you'll improve your shot selection and placement.  A good shot follow through gives perfect lift to the ball and prevents you from injuries.  

hold the bat the way you get a full powered swing.  take a strong batting stance.  get your feet moving while playing hard shots.  position your head.  finish your shot with a clean follow through.

If you're trying to heal someone (a more advanced technique), think "Heal (name)." repeatedly.  As long as you have a goal and a means to accomplish it, you're pretty much set.  

if you've made it this far, congratulations!,  picture what you want to do.  you can use aura in other ways as well. 

 Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, stir in the pasta. Wait for the water to return to a boil, and cook the pasta for six minutes. After six minutes, add the beans and broccoli and boil for an additional two minutes.After two minutes, remove the pot from the heat.  Pour the pasta and vegetables into a large colander to drain the water. Rinse everything with cold water to remove excess starch. Let the pasta and vegetables drip dry for a couple minutes, then return them to the pot.Set the pot aside while you cook the remaining ingredients.  Pour the oil into a large skillet and heat it over medium heat. When the oil is shimmering, add the mushrooms, pepper, and chicken. Season with the Italian seasoning, and salt and pepper, to taste. Cook the mixture for six to eight minutes, until there’s no pink left in the chicken.Once cooked, transfer the chicken mixture to the pot with the pasta, beans, and broccoli.  Transfer the butter to a medium saucepan and melt it over medium heat. Add the garlic and onion. Cook for five to seven minutes, until the onions become soft and aromatic. Whisk in the flour, tomato paste, and milk.  Continue cooking until the mixture simmers and becomes thick, about five to six minutes., Turn the heat to low. Add the cheese and keep stirring until the cheese is melted. Remove the saucepan from the heat, and whisk the cheese sauce until the cheese and base are fully combined.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste. You can use any processed cheese in place of the Velveeta, such as slices of processed American or Swiss cheese. To make a spicy cheese sauce, add a pinch of cayenne pepper and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes., Pour the cheese sauce into the pot with the pasta, chicken, and vegetables. Stir to combine. Transfer the casserole mixture to a baking dish or casserole dish that’s freezer- and oven-safe. Place it into the refrigerator uncovered, and let it cool for an hour.  You’ll need a baking or casserole dish that can hold 3 quarts (2.8 L) for this casserole recipe., Once cooled, cover the casserole with an airtight lid or tightly with plastic wrap. For short-term storage, keep the casserole in the refrigerator and eat it within four days. For longer-term storage, keep the casserole in the freezer and eat it within four months., When you're ready to eat the casserole, remove it from the freezer and let it thaw in the refrigerator overnight. When the casserole is thawed, cover it with foil and bake it in a preheated 350 F (177 C) oven for 75 minutes. In the final half hour, uncover the casserole and sprinkle the panko on top. Finish baking the casserole uncovered.  As the casserole bakes, stir it every 30 minutes to ensure it heats evenly throughout. 

cook the pasta, beans, and broccoli.  drain and rinse.  cook the chicken and remaining vegetables.  make the cheese sauce base.  add the cheese.  combine all ingredients and transfer to a casserole dish.  freeze or refrigerate.  bake when ready. 

 Up until quite recently in history, the vast majority of births occurred in the home. As of 2009, however, in the United States, only about 0.72% of all births were home births.Statistics for most other developed countries are similarly low. Despite their relatively rarity in developed nations in the modern era, some mothers greatly prefer home births to hospital births. There are numerous reasons why a mother might choose a home birth over a hospital birth. However, it should be noted that some scientific studies have associated home births with a 2-3 times greater risk of complication.Though the elevated rate of complication is still not very high in absolute terms (corresponding with only several births experiencing complications per every 1,000), undecided mothers should understand that home births may be slightly more risky than hospital births. On the other hand, home births offer certain advantages that hospital births may not be able to, including:Greater freedom for the mother to move, bathe, and eat as she sees fit A greater ability for the mother to adjust her position during labor The comfort of familiar surroundings and faces The ability to give birth without medical assistance (like the use of painkillers), if desired The ability to meet religious or cultural expectations for birth Lower overall cost, in some situations; , In certain situations, births carry an increased risk of complication for the child, the mother, or both. In these situations, the health of the mother and child outweigh any minor advantages a home birth may offer, so the birth should be carried out in a hospital, where experienced doctors and life-saving medical technology are available. Here are situations in which an expectant mother should definitely plan to give birth in a hospital:When the mother has any chronic health condition (diabetes, epilepsy, etc.) When the mother has undergone a C-section for a previous pregnancy If prenatal screening has revealed any health concerns for the unborn child If the mother has developed a pregnancy-associated health condition If the mother uses tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs If the mother has twins, triplets, etc. or if the child hasn't settled into a head-first position for delivery If a birth is premature or late. In other words, don't plan a home birth before the 37th week of pregnancy or after the 41st week.  Generally, home births are not prohibited by most state or national governments. In the UK, Australia, and Canada, home birth is legal, and, depending on the circumstances, the government may provide funding for it. However, the legal situation in the United States surrounding midwives is somewhat more complicated.   In the United States, it is legal in all 50 states to hire a certified nurse midwife (CNM).CNMs are certified nurses who usually work in hospitals - though it's rare for them to make house calls, it is legal to hire them for home births in every state. In 27 states, it is also legal to hire a direct-entry midwife or certified professional midwife (CPM).Direct-entry midwives are midwives who attained their status through self-study, apprenticeship, etc. and are not required to be a nurse or doctor. CPMs are certified by the North American Registry of Midwives (NARM). CPMs are not required to carry insurance and are not subject to peer review.  It's highly recommended that you have a certified midwife or doctor accompany you for your home birth. Make plans to have the midwife or doctor come to your home well in advance - meet and discuss your birth with him or her before your labor is likely to begin, and keep his or her number on hand so you can call if your labor begins unexpectedly.   The Mayo Clinic also recommends making sure the doctor or midwife has easy access to the consultation of doctors at a nearby hospital, if possible.You may also want to consider finding or hiring a doula - someone who provides continuous physical and emotional support throughout a mother's labor.  Giving birth is an emotionally and physically draining experience, to put it lightly. The last thing you'll want to do during labor, when you may in intense distress, is to have to make quick, important decisions about the way the birth will proceed. It's far smarter to create and review an approximate plan for your birth well before you enter labor. Try to account for every step of your delivery, from beginning to end. Even if you're not able to follow your plan exactly, having the plan will give you peace of mind. In your plan, try to answer questions like the following ones:Besides the doctor/midwife, which people, if any, do you want present for the birth? Where do you plan to deliver? Note that, for much of your labor, you will be able to move around for comfort. What supplies should you plan on having? Talk to your doctor - usually, you'll want lots of extra towels, sheets, pillows, and blankets, plus waterproof coverings for the bed and floor. How will you manage the pain? Will you use medical painkillers, the Lamaze technique or another form of pain management?  , The vast majority of home births are successful and free of complication. However, as with every birth, there is always a small chance that things can go wrong which threaten the health of the child and/or mother. Because of this, it's important to be prepared to rush the mother to a hospital in the event of an emergency. Keep a full tank of gas in your car, and keep your car well-stocked with cleaning supplies, blankets, and towels. Know the quickest route to the nearest hospital - you may even want to practice driving there.  Though you'll be able to adjust your position and even walk around for most of your labor, it's a good idea to have a place in your home set aside as the final site of childbirth. Choose a safe, comfortable spot - many mothers prefer their own bed, but it's possible to give birth on sofas or even on a soft part of the floor. Regardless of the location you choose, make sure that, by the time labor begins, it's been recently-cleaned and it's well-stocked with towels, blankets, and pillows. You'll probably also want to use a water-tight plastic sheet or covering to prevent blood stains.   In a pinch, a clean, dry shower curtain will work as a water-tight barrier to prevent stains. Though your doctor or midwife will most likely have these things, you may also want to have sterile gauze pads and ties ready nearby for cutting the baby's cord.  Once you've made all the necessary preparations, simply wait for your labor to begin. On average, most pregnancies usually last about 38 weeks, though healthy labor can begin within a week or two of the 38 week mark.If you enter labor before the 37th week of pregnancy or after the 41st week, proceed immediately to a hospital. Otherwise, be prepared for any of the following signs of your labor beginning:Your water breaking Dilation of the cervix Bloody show (the discharge of a pinkish or brownish blood-tinged mucous) Contractions lasting 30 to 90 seconds  , The healthcare professional you have chosen for your home birth has been trained to deliver babies safely and has been certified to do so. Always listen to your doctor or midwife's advice and do your best to follow it. Some of the things s/he may advise can temporarily cause your pain to increase. However, doctors and midwives ultimately want to help you get through your labor as quickly and safely as possible, so try to follow their commands as best you can.   The rest of the advice in this section is intended merely as a rough guide - always defer to the advice of your doctor or midwife.  Labor can be a prolonged, painful ordeal, and a certain degree of nervousness is almost inevitable. However, it's never a good idea to give in to thoughts of desperation or hopelessness. Do your best to stay as relaxed and lucid as possible. This will allow you to follow your doctor or midwife's instructions to the best of your ability, ensuring your labor is as quick and safe as possible. It's easiest to stay relaxed if you're in a comfortable position and breathing deeply.  As previously noted, most home births occur without a hitch. However, complications are always a small possibility during childbirth. If you notice any of the following signs, proceed to a hospital immediately, as these may signify serious pregnancy complications which require the technology and expertise available at a hospital:Traces of feces appear in your amniotic fluid when your water breaks The umbilical cord drops into your vagina before the baby does You have vaginal bleeding not involved with your bloody show or if your bloody show contains an especially large amount of blood (normal bloody shows are pink, brown, or somewhat blood-tinged) You don't deliver the placenta after the child is born or the placenta isn't delivered intact Your baby isn't born head-first Your baby appears distressed in any way Labor does not progress into childbirth  , During the first stage of labor, your cervix dilates, thinning and widening to allow for the passage of the baby. At first, discomfort may be minimal. Over time, your contractions will gradually become more frequent and more intense. You may start to feel pain or pressure in your lower back or abdomen that increases as your cervix dilates. As your cervix dilates, your attendant should perform frequent pelvic exams to monitor its progress. When it's fully dilated with a width of about 10 centimeter (3.9 in), you're ready to enter the second phase of labor.   You may begin to feel an urge to push - your attendant will usually tell you not to do so until your cervix has dilated to 10 centimeter (3.9 in). At this point, it is usually not too late to receive pain medication.If you have planned for this possibility and have painkillers on hand, talk to your doctor or midwife to assess whether or not they are appropriate.  In the second stage of labor, your contractions will become more frequent and more intense. You may feel a strong urge to push - if your cervix is fully dilated, your birth attendant will give you the OK to do so. Communicate with your doctor or midwife, notifying him or her of any changes in your condition. S/he will instruct you when to push, how to breathe, and when to rest. Follow these instructions as well as you are able. This stage of labor can last up to 2 hours for first-time mothers, while in subsequent deliveries this stage can be far shorter (sometimes as short as 15 minutes).Don't be afraid to try different positions, like getting on all fours, kneeling, or squatting. Your doctor or midwife will usually want you to be in the position that is most comfortable and allows you to push most effectively. As you push and strain, don't worry about accidentally urinating or defecating - this is extremely common and your birth attendant will expect it. Concentrate solely on pushing out the baby.  The force of your pushing, combined with your contractions, will move your baby from the uterus into the birth canal. At this point, your attendant may be able to see the baby's head. This is called "crowning" - you can use a mirror to see it yourself. Don't be frustrated if, after crowning, the baby's head disappears - this is normal. Over time, the baby's position will shift down the birth canal. You'll need to push hard to get the baby's head out. As soon as this happens, your birth attendant should clear the baby's nose and mouth of any amniotic fluid and assist you in pushing the rest of the baby's body out.Breech birth (when a baby's feet come out before its head) is a medical condition that carries added risks for the baby and will most likely necessitate a trip to the hospital. Most breech births today result in C-sections.  Congratulations - you have just had a successful home birth. Have the doctor or midwife clamp and cut the baby's umbilical cord using a sterile pair of scissors. Clean the baby by wiping him or her with clean towels, then clothing him or her and wrapping him or her in a clean, warm blanket.   After giving birth, the birth attendant may recommend initiating breast feeding. Do not bathe the baby immediately. At birth you will notice the baby will have a whitish covering. This is normal - the covering is called a vernix. It is thought to provide protection from bacterial infections and moisturize the baby's skin.  After the baby is born, though the worst is over, you aren't quite done. In the third and final stage of labor, you must deliver the placenta, which is the organ that nourished your baby while it was in the womb. Mild contractions (so mild, in fact, that some mothers don't notice them) separate the placenta from the uterine wall. Soon after, the placenta passes through the birth canal. This process usually takes about 5-20 minutes and, compared to delivering a baby, is a relatively minor ordeal.   If your placenta doesn't come out or doesn't come out in one piece, go to the hospital - this is a medical condition that, if ignored, can have potentially serious consequences.  If your baby appears perfectly healthy after birth, it probably is. However, it's important to take your new son or daughter to a doctor for a medical examination within a few days of birth to make sure s/he isn't suffering from any medical conditions that can't easily be detected. Plan a visit to a pediatrician within a day or two after giving birth. Your pediatrician will examine your baby and give you care instructions.   You may also want to receive a medical examination yourself - childbirth is an intense, demanding process, and if you feel out of the ordinary in any way, it's best to have a doctor determine whether anything is wrong.  Water birthing is exactly what it sounds like - giving birth in a pool of water. This method of birth has become more popular in recent years - some hospitals even offer birthing pools. However, some doctors don't consider it to be as safe as conventional birth. While some mothers swear by water birthing, claiming that it's more relaxing, comfortable, pain-free, and "natural" than normal birth methods, it does carry certain risks, including:Infection from contaminated water Complications from the baby swallowing water Though very rare, there is also a risk of brain damage or death from oxygen deprivation while the baby is underwater.  Like any home birth, water births shouldn't be attempted if the baby or mother are at risk for certain complications. If any of the conditions listed in Part One apply to your pregnancy, do not attempt a water birth - instead, plan to go to a hospital. Additionally, you shouldn't attempt a water birth if you have herpes or another genital infection, as these can be transferred to the baby via water., Within the first 15 minutes of labor, have your doctor/midwife or a friend fill a small pool about a foot deep with water. Special pools designed specifically for water births are available for renting or purchase - some forms of medical insurance will cover the cost. Take your clothing off below the waist (you may choose to be completely nude if you prefer) and enter the pool.   Make sure your water is clean and no hotter than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (about 37 degrees Celsius)., Some mothers prefer having their partner (spouse, etc.) in the pool with them while they give birth for emotional support and intimacy. Others prefer to have their doctor or midwife in the pool. If you plan on having your partner in the pool with you, you may want to experiment with leaning back on the partner's body for support as you push.  Your doctor or midwife will assist you through your labor, helping you breathe, push, and rest when it's appropriate. When you start feeling the baby coming, ask your doctor/midwife or partner to reach between your legs so s/he will be able to grab the baby as soon as it comes out. You will want to have your hands free to hold on tight when pushing.   As with normal labor, you may change your position for comfort. You may, for instance, try pushing while laying or kneeling in the water. If, at any point, you or the baby show any signs of complications (See Part Three), get out of the pool.  As soon as the baby is out, hold it above water so that it's able to breathe. After momentarily cradling the baby, carefully get out of the pool so that your cord can be cut and the baby can be dried, clothed, and wrapped in a blanket.   In some cases, the baby will have his or her first bowel movement in the womb. In this case, get the baby's head above water and away from any contaminated water immediately, as serious infection can occur if the baby inhales or drinks any of its own feces. If you believe that this may have happened, take your baby to a hospital immediately.

 You could use a coffee pot if you like the taste of burnt coffee.; ,, Ten minutes or so would be good to get the full flavour.  You don't really have to bother measuring out any amount but remember that it'll taste sweeter when it's hot than it will after it's chilled and iced. ,, The best way is to use glass jars. Decant the tea off into the jars, but leave enough room to dilute it a little if you've brewed your tea strong; add water to get it just right. Leave the mint leaves in the jar, so that the tea gets more mint flavor over time. Also, since the tea will be cooling, don't screw the lids on too tight. That makes it harder to get at the tea later.You can pour the warm tea straight over ice and drink it right away, preferably stretched out somewhere comfortable and shady. Or you can set the jars in the fridge to chill and have a tasty glass.when its ready  

boil the water.  then turn off the heat and add the bags of tea.  ,  wait for them to steep.  next add the sugar.  at this stage you can also add the honey and mint.  ,  now it is time to store and chill your tea.  ,  a big plastic pitcher isn't good for storing tea unless you plan to use it for a picnic. 

 As you send her those signals, see what she does. If she blushes or smiles, you're on the right track.   If she seems confused, don't fret. You may just be going too fast. Jog back a bit and take it slow. If she's not reciprocating, it's not the right moment. Be patient. It may have nothing to do with you.  If you're in the middle of an action movie and she's so entranced the popcorn is missing her mouth, it's not the right time. Use your own senses of whether or not to get close and personal.   If it's not happening, create it. Walk her to her door, take her somewhere new, or learn to play her favorite song.  Look at her eyes and lips. Getting impatient or distracted (or, God forbid, focusing on other parts of her body) may scare her away.   Focusing will make her easier to read. Knowing if a girl wants to kiss is half the battle.  If she senses you're even the slightest bit unhappy, she may be not want to take the risk. Remember: she's reading you, too!   Smiling will put both of you in a better mood. It's contagious and tricks the mind.  The moment is good whether she kisses you or not. Even if she doesn't now, you're putting in time for later.   It's easy to sense when someone is nervous. Your heart will race and you'll perspire. Remember to breathe.  

watch her reactions.  make sure the moment is right.  focus.  smile.  relax. 

 Large potatoes serve one person each, but you'll need 3 or 4 smaller potatoes per person.  Make them as small or as large as you want them, depending on your preferences for potato salad. Boil them in water until fork-tender (as shown above), but do not overcook.  Allow them to drain.   The water from the potatoes will drain into the bowl.       When the potatoes have drained, discard the water.       Place the potatoes in a mixing bowl and set aside to cool.  In a small bowl, whisk together the following ingredients, adding more or less of each one to taste:  1/2 cup mayonnaise       1/4 cup white vinegar       1/2 teaspoon garlic powder       1/2 teaspoon salt       1/2 teaspoon black pepper        , Make sure each potato is well coated in dressing. Add the following ingredients of your choosing:   Chopped hard-boiled eggs       Chopped green or red peppers       Minced green onion, chives or shallots        , Serve at a picnic, or alongside barbecue or another summer dish.  

remove potatoes from the freezer.  use a sharp knife to chop the potatoes into bite-sized chunks.  place the potato pieces in a colander inside a bowl.  make the dressing.  pour the dressing over the potatoes and mix.  place the potato salad in a serving bowl. 

 Report any unseen errors to the company. Such ideas to look through include all your paychecks, rent statements, car payments, grocery bills, receipts and the like. Make sure they are not only calculated correctly, but have the same exact items (including in quantity as well) of the items you bought during the trip.   Include minimum debt payments in the expenses. Compare the total of these expenses to your after-tax income. Ideally, the expenses total will be less than your income total.; , Look to save at least $500 per month after all bills are paid. Even if you can only save $10 a month (after all bills), you'll still make out in the long run.  Have your employer put aside some of your money into your pension account (if they offer any). If not, IRAs found at most banks can do the trick.   With IRAs, you'll have to make your own deposits, but you are saving.    Use that certificate of deposit, as collateral for a loan. Over time this will improve your credit score by showing a credit history. , Anywhere you can save each month is necessary. This is not easy, but if you can do it, it will simplify your finances and build your emergency fund.  Not only is most of the items still in wearable shape, but its also a lot cheaper. You may have to wash it an extra time in between transport home and first wearing, but that's a small price to pay for your discount here.  Credit card purchases are only luxury purchases, and when you are in a financial crunch (with a limited budget) there is no room for luxury at a time like this.  

look over all financial activity for issues.  set up a savings account.  start an ira or pension to save money for your retirement.  purchase a $500 (or your division of currency) to $1000 (or your division of currency) certificate of deposit (cd) at the bank if you have enough money to do this.  extreme coupon on any item that you actually find you'll actually need/or that will be used in the near future.  ,  try to find discounts on partially-used items, and buy these items instead.  shop at thrift stores and discount stores/second-hand stores as much as possible.  use cash (as opposed to credit cards) as much as possible. 

 Although you may be looking for an antique appeal, make sure your springs have been relieved of all dust and debris. Use mild dish soap and a clean rag to wipe down each spring.  Before you wire it together you’ll want to see how it will appear.   Start by placing one spring on a flat surface, large spring facing downward (on the surface).       Next to the first spring, place another spring, this time with the small spring on the surface and the large spring at the top.       Continue this as a pattern while creating a circular shape.  Cut two to three pieces of wire to bind the springs to one another.   Wind one wire to join the top springs and one to join the bottom springs. Considering doubling up if the springs are made from a heavy material or if they aren’t holding together with just one on each side.       Continue winding the wire around the springs to join them together.    Add decors like gems, stones or ribbons. 

inspect and clean springs.  position springs in a circle to “sketch” out your wreath.  wire springs together.  spray paint it.  hang it on your door!

 You can type up your permission slips using a program like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or Pages. For most cases, use a clear and standard font such as Times New Roman or Arial in size 11 or 12.; , Answer all the questions that pertain to the specific activity. These could include: who, what, when, where, why, how much, as well as the means of transportation. This information, which summarizes the trip, should be at the top of the document. Here is an example of how these questions can be answered in the permission slip:Who: Mrs. Tucker’s English class What: The class will be taking a trip to the Alberta Street Library. When: 8:30am - 11:30am, Friday, May 10th, 2019 Where: The Alberta Street Library Why: The class will be going to take a tour of the library. Cost: No cost Means of Transportation: We will take a school bus.  You need to have a statement where the parent or guardian writes that they give permission for their child to take the trip. Here is an example of this line: I, (parent or guardian’s name), give permission for my child, (child’s name), to attend the field trip to (location of field trip) with (organization or adult’s name who is leading the trip).  If a child has specific allergies or a medical condition, or if the trip is over an extended period of time, include space for the parent or guardian to give information about allergies and medical conditions.   Write this as, “Relevant Allergies/Medical Conditions:_________.”  , Create a line for an emergency contact phone number on the slip. This is the person that can be called if something happens to the child and their parent or guardian can't be reached.You can write "Emergency Contact Name: _________" and "Emergency Contact Phone Number: _________."  , Perhaps the most important part of the permission slip is the parent or guardian’s signature. At the bottom of all the information about the trip, the parent or guardian needs to sign the paper! Write “Parent or Guardian Signature: _________” at the bottom of the slip. 

use a word-processing program on your computer.  include all of the relevant details for the activity.  create a line for the parent or guardian to give explicit permission.  include space for medical details.  add an emergency contact option.  ask for the parent or guardian's signature. 

 Email trackers allow you to put a timestamp on your email so you can know whether it has been read or not. They essentially "track" your email as it is sent to the recipient.

 You need to complete Form I-539 to request an extension of your B-2 tourist visa. You can download the form and the instructions from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website.You do not have to complete a form for every person in your family. Instead, you can include your spouse and unmarried children under age 21 on your form. Everyone must have a B-2 tourist visa. Unfortunately, USCIS is no longer accepting online submissions, so you need to complete the paper application.; , You should complete your form by using a typewriter or printing neatly using black ink. You can also download the form as a PDF and type your information directly into it. The form will ask for the following information:name Alien Registration Number mailing and physical address date of birth travel details I-94 Arrival-Departure Record Number passport number and expiration date country which issued your passport information about your criminal history signature under penalty of perjury (required)  , In order to provide complete and accurate information, you may need more space than what is supplied on the form. In this situation, you can type additional information on a separate sheet of paper, which you can attach to the application. Each additional sheet should have the following information at the top of the page:your name your Alien Registration Number (if any) the page number, part number and item number your answer refers to  , You should file at least 45 days before your visa expires.Accordingly, don’t delay. If your visa expires while USCIS is reviewing your application, then you can still stay in the country.   USCIS will not begin removal proceedings unless your application is denied., You can still apply for an extension even if your visa has expired. However, you will need proof of circumstances beyond your control. For example, the following circumstances may qualify:A medical emergency prevented you from applying for an extension in time. Someone stole your passport and other travel documents, or you lost them. You attempted to file a request for an extension but it was returned to you.  You need to submit a written statement along with your application. You can format the statement as a business letter. Ideally, you should type up your letter so that it is easy to read.  You need to tell USCIS why you want to extend your tourist visa.Go into as much detail as possible. For example, you may want to spend more time with your family.   If you need to extend your stay because of an emergency, then state that reason as well.  When you applied for your visa, you had to show USCIS your plans to eventually leave the country. You will have to provide this same information when you apply for an extension.Give USCIS the date and flight number for your new departure flight. Of course, you can’t book it until your visa extension is approved, but you can tell USCIS the day and time you intend to leave.  In your letter, make sure that you explain what effect your extended stay on a tourist visa will have on your life back home. For example, make sure to explain whether it will impact your employment or residency.Generally, it should have no impact. You can explain that you are not intending to move permanently to the U.S. and that your job and home still wait for your return in your home country.  The U.S. government wants to make sure that you can support yourself during your extended stay in the country. For this reason, you should provide proof that you can fund your stay. Provide the following:Bank accounts showing that you have enough money to support yourself. If you have online banking, then you can access this information from a computer in the U.S. Pay stubs or other proof of income. You might not have this information with you.

Alternately, they could request that you show up for an interview.You should provide requested information as soon as possible.  USCIS will let you know in writing if it has approved your request. If USCIS denies your extension request, then your current visa immediately becomes void, even if you haven’t reached the expiration date.Accordingly, you need to make immediate plans to leave the United States.  If you applied for entry to the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program, then you are not travelling under a visa. For this reason, you can’t extend it. However, in certain emergencies, you may be able to get a 30-day extension.You should visit the InfoPass website at USCIS and schedule an appointment.At your appointment, you can explain your situation.  You are not eligible to extend a B-2 tourist visa if you have done something that would make you ineligible for a B-2 visa.For example, the following would disqualify you:   You committed a crime in the U.S. You spent time in the U.S. doing something other than being a tourist. For example, you might have started working a job, which a B-2 visa does not give you permission to do.  If you stay in the U.S. without permission, then you are breaking the law. Depending on your circumstances, you may want to meet with an immigration attorney to discuss your options.   See Find an Immigration Lawyer for tips. Schedule a consultation and take your papers or proof of emergency to show the attorney.

 Be sure to address exactly what it is that your teacher wants out of this report. That is the key step to getting good marks.; , There is a lot of information out there on dinosaurs. The key to preparing a good report is to choose a distinctive topic within the subject of dinosaurs and to investigate deeply within the narrow confines of that topic. For example, ideas that might be suitable for exacting research include:   Methods of finding dinosaur fossils or methods for preserving them A study of the eating habits of herbivore dinosaurs or carnivore dinosaurs Examination of the changes in thinking of paleontologists about the coloring and textures of dinosaurs A study of how dinosaurs are displayed in museums Research into the perils of being a young dinosaur  , Good research takes account of competing ideas. This means that you can discuss both arguments while still preferring one side over the other, but you must provide reasons for why you think your ideas are preferable. For example, you might write something like:   Dinosaur display methods are generally able to convey to the public what dinosaurs looked like. However, Hobson says that some museums are not doing a very good job at displaying the larger dinosaur exhibits because they don't have high enough roofs. I disagree with this because I have visited 8 museums and only one of the eight had a roof problem and even then I would propose the following solution to fix that.  Explain what you looked at, the issues you are raising and your conclusion. Write clearly in the report and avoid making sweeping statements. Try to keep your theme flowing throughout the report and make a sensible conclusion based on the things written in your report.  A good report will show that you have done the research and not just made up everything off the top of your head. Acknowledge quotes and ideas properly and create a bibliography detailing the books, online resources, museum visits, interviews, etc., that you have used to inform your report.  With modern printing methods and computing, there is little excuse for not producing wonderful illustrations of dinosaurs to spruce up your report. You can still draw your own illustrations, of course, just be sure to scan them in and include them in your printed report.  Use hard card, images and fancy fonts to make the front cover. Join the report together with staples, binding, or twine. You might even like to consider making the cover in the shape of a dinosaur.  

read the question or request from your teacher.  research.  balance your research.  have a strong introduction that sets the scene about the research in your report.  leave references for your teacher to follow.  use pictures.  consider presenting your report as something different by giving it a cover design. 

 Many sports psychologists talk about visualization all the time and many of the athletes across the globe use this kind of technique to boost their performance. The night before you exercise, try to take at least ten minutes to visualize the entire session in your mind. Imagine yourself getting up, working out and at least feeling energized and accomplished afterwards. You need to go through the entire exercise routine in your mind. By visualizing, you will able to adjust and at least prepare yourself for your fitness routine the following day.; , Many people usually underestimate the power of having fun and enjoying the routine when it comes to exercise. A recent study shows that if you are not happy and perceive your exercise as work, then you are more inclined to slack.  Try to pick up a certain sport or join dance classes that you used to love or always wanted to try. Why not pump up your workout with music? Music can change your perception of how difficult the tasks are. And breathing throughout heavy routines can give you the added stamina you need.  It is always important that you remain positive throughout the whole fitness routine. You can reframe your negative thoughts to some positive ones. Reframing is a type of cognitive-behavioral method that can support people to become higher functioning in all areas of life. Doing self-talk has a very powerful ability on your motivation and ability to perform. Focus your thoughts on your own strengths, like how you made time to exercise or how you worked out even though you did not feel like it.  You may already know from research that some “feel good” chemicals like serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine are released in your brain every time you perform an exercise routine. Yet, when you do your workout consistently, some of the new dopamine receptors are made in the motivation center of the brain. Through exercising, it becomes a self-reinforcing behavior. Consistency is the key to achieve optimal results.  A positive reinforcement can be an effective way to keep yourself on the right track. Rewards throughout the process are also well-deserved when you start and maintain a fitness routine. Try to give yourself some rewards daily or weekly. Or take a trip to the spa or get a massage to unwind. The short and long-term rewards are very important. Try planning a celebration one to four months in advance where you can show off the results.  If you miss a day or a few days working out, tomorrow is another opportunity to thrive. Be kind to yourself during your process, there will be ups and downs. Don't give up!  

visualize yourself in action.  think of something enjoyable and fun associated with exercising.  find an activity you enjoy.  focus on your strengths.  be consistent.  reward yourself.  self compassion is everything. 

 This will bring up a list of YouTube to MP3 converters that you can download to your computer.  Your search should return a long list of conversion programs, many of which will be free. These programs will vary in ease of use, MP3 quality, and the level of privacy they provide. To ensure that you’re choosing a high-quality and reputable program, search its name plus “reviews” to see what other users have said about it.   Ultimately you’ll want something that will not slow down your computer or put anything harmful such as malware or viruses on it.  Signs that you’ve downloaded malware include pop-up ads and spam; your home page changing to a site you don’t recognize; and being redirected to unfamiliar pages., There will likely be several different versions of the software to suit different operating systems. Ensure that you download the correct version of the software for your operating system.   You’ll also want to make sure that the software is compatible with your operating system version. If you're unsure of how to check which operating system version you're using, type “how to check <operating system name> version” into your search engine. For example, to check which Mac operating system you’re using, click on the apple icon in the upper left-hand corner of your desktop. This will open a drop-down menu, from which you will choose the first option: “About this Mac.” A small pop-up window will then open that lists details about your computer, including which operating system (OS X) and version you’re using.  Clicking “download” on the software website will start the installation process. Each program will have a different installation process, so just follow the installation wizard.   During the download process you may be prompted to download other software or toolbars that are not part of the conversion software. You likely don’t want these on your computer. Usually you can avoid downloading them by simply unchecking the checkboxes during installation. You may need to restart your computer once you’ve finished installing the conversion software, so ensure that you’ve saved everything you want to save before beginning the installation. , To copy the video’s URL, go to the address bar (at the top center of your browser window), highlight the url, and right click your mouse and choose “copy”, or hit ctrl+c (on a PC) or command+c (on a Mac).  Open your new conversion program and paste the URL into the appropriate box (it will likely say “paste URL” or something similar). To paste, right click your mouse and select “paste”, or hit ctrl+v (on a PC) or command+v (on a Mac).  The conversion software will likely offer you a few options for your download. The higher the quality, the larger the file, meaning it will take up more space on your computer’s hard drive — on the other hand, it will also likely sound better.   You can always go back and download a higher-quality version of the file by simply repeating the download process and selecting a higher quality. Don’t be afraid to experiment with file sizes to find what works best for you.  Some conversion programs will automatically fill in song details such as artist, song title, album, and release date. Check to ensure that these are correct before you click the “download” or “convert” button on your conversion program.  MP3 files will generally be downloaded by default into your “Music” folder. Double-check that the MP3 file will go where you want it to go by viewing the conversion program’s “preferences” or “tools > options” folder, and ensuring that the “output” is saved to a folder of your choosing.  Once you’ve chosen your file, quality settings, and download folder you're ready to download the video. The conversion program will download the video from YouTube and then convert it to an MP3 file. The whole process shouldn’t take more than a few minutes, unless you’re downloading something much longer than a single song — for example, an hour-long presentation.  Once it’s been downloaded, you’ll be able to find your MP3 file in your previously specified folder. You can then play the file using a media player (for example, Windows Media Player or iTunes) and/or add it to your music library.  

type “youtube to mp3 conversion software” into your browser’s search engine.  choose a converter.  download the program.  download the conversion software.  go to youtube and find the video that you want to convert to mp3.  ,  copy the video url.  paste the url into the conversion software.  choose your download quality.  ensure that the file is named appropriately.  choose a download folder.  download the file.  play your file. 

 While this probably isn’t a look you should do every day, it’s great for a night out or when you’re in the mood to be experimental. The liquid eyeliner comes in a rainbow of colors these days, so you have plenty of options. Bright blue has been popular on the runway, but go with what you like!         When you’re doing a statement look like this, it’s important to keep the rest of your makeup minimal. Pulling off multiple dramatic makeups looks simultaneously doesn’t typically work well (unless you’re in costume).  Experiment with a central shade that you use to pull all of your makeup together, like red. For instance, you could use a cherry red liquid lipstick on your lips and use that same color on your cheeks as a subtle blush, similar to the way you’d use a cream blush on your cheeks. Find a matching cherry red eyeliner to create your dots. It may sound a little over the top, but others have pulled it off – you can, too!        , Liquid eyeliners in metallic shades like gold, silver and bronze have become popular in recent years, so they’re not hard to find at drugstores and beauty supply shops. Create a unique look by using them for dot eyeliner. Try creating barely perceptible pinpoints with metallic shades for a unique sparkle. 

try a statement color like orange or bright aqua.  try red dots that match your lipstick shade.  give metallic shades a try.

 Flipping a house for profit involves a number of costs, including the home down payment, mortgage, interest payments, property taxes, real estate closing costs, inspections, permits, and contractors' fees.These costs add up quickly, and the flipped house might not sell at a profit. Before you decide whether to go ahead with flipping a house, you should ask yourself:   What will you do if the house does not sell right away? Would it be possible to use the house as a rental property, for example?If you do not have a reasonable back-up plan if something goes wrong with the sale of the flipped house, you might want to reevaluate your plans. Are the potential profits worth the risk of a considerable loss? In 2015, houses priced below $50,000, saw negative returns. On the other hand, homes priced at $100,000 – $200,000, yielded an average gross return of 44%.Keep in mind that selling a house in which you have never lived might also involve heavy tax payments, which can lower your profit margin considerably.Can your investment partners weather the risk of a potential loss? Have you done your research on local real estate markets, remodeling costs, and permits? In order to have a successful house-flipping experience, you have to educate yourself on local home prices, school districts, responsible contractors, and real estate regulations.; , Sweat equity refers to the amount of value you might add to your home due to your own labor.For example, if you are a skilled roofer or licensed plumber, perhaps you can undertake some of the home repairs yourself. This will cut down on your overhead and reduce the amount of money you have to borrow.   Be sure that you take into account the amount of time you'll spend working on the flipped house. Your time also has value, and flipping a house can sometimes take months of work.Consider whether other ways of spending your time might be more lucrative or more enjoyable. More importantly, will the partners putting up the financial stake consider that your sweat equity has any value? If so, how much value compared to their hard cash? Be sure to adhere to all local regulations when you undertake home repairs yourself. Discuss your plans with a real estate attorney or local regulations board if you require approval for any construction or repairs.  If you do not have money for a flipped house yourself, you will need to take out a loan to cover your initial costs. No matter who your lender is — a partner, a bank, or a private lender — you will have to demonstrate that you have the capability of repaying your loan. Your credit score reflects your credit history, your ability to pay off your loans, and your overall debt load. The better your credit score, the better the chances that you will be able to secure a loan at an affordable interest rate.   There are a few different credit rating systems, but in general your credit score will be a number somewhere between 300-850.The higher your score, the better your credit is. You can get a free report with your credit score every 12 months by visiting https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action .  If your credit score is too low for you to be able to secure loans for a house-flipping venture, you might want to take some time to improve your credit score. This can take some time, but it might be worthwhile in the long run. Moreover, the better your credit score is, the more likely it is that you will be able to weather a potential loss from house-flipping. To improve your credit score you can:   Pay off your debts in a timely way. If you do not have a good history of paying off your debt, you will not be able to secure a decent loan for a flipped house.Keep your overall debt load to a minimum. Avoid maintaining a credit card balance if you can.Only have credit lines when absolutely necessary. Do not have more credit cards than you require for your day-to-day life.Protect your identity. Monitor your credit card transactions and your credit rating to make sure that your identity has not been stolen by a thief or a hacker. Take reasonable security precautions to protect your information. For example, do not log into your online banking system unless you are on a secure, password-protected network., A financial advisor will be able to look at your current financial situation and help you determine how much risk you can afford to take on as part of a house-flipping investment. A financial advisor might also be able to help you come up with a plan for meeting your expenses even if your flipped house takes a long time to sell or requires extra repairs.  In order to flip a house successfully, you will have to make your decisions based on logic and research, not on your emotions. Before you begin the process of finding a lender and purchasing a house, it is wise for you to have a solid business plan in place. This plan should keep you on the right track for making a wise investment as well as provide confidence to your potential lenders and partners that you can make a profit. Your business plan should include:   A maximum purchase price of the home that you will flip. A list of in-demand neighborhoods where you will target your search. Pay particular attention to school districts, neighborhood safety, and proximity to amenities such as shops and public transit.A maximum cost of repairs and remodels that you can afford. A list of dependable, affordable, licensed contractors who can undertake repairs successfully. A reasonable estimate for the After Repair Value (ARV) of the flipped home. Ideally, the initial sales price will be no more than 70% of the home's ARV.A sense of who your buyer is and what they want. Will your buyer likely be a retired couple? A young businessperson? A couple with children? Depending on the neighborhood, your potential buyers might want very different things out of a home. Consider who your likely buyer will be and what they might need out of their house. For example, if you are looking at flipping a home in a neighborhood with a great school district, you might consider a remodel that has young children in mind.A specific buyer. In some cases, you might be able to line up a buyer before you flip the house. In this case, your risks are much lower as are your overhead costs.A plan for how to repay your loan if something goes wrong. Do not flip a house unless you can meet your expenses, even if something were to go wrong with your sale. For example, you might have a buyer fall through, or you might discover a problem with the foundation of the home. Build in a margin for error in your business plan, and brainstorm possible ways to weather a delay in the sale of the home or unexpected expenses.  

evaluate your tolerance for risk.  consider your ability to provide "sweat equity," and the value of that work.  know your credit score.  improve your credit score.  talk to a financial advisor.  make a business plan. 

 Before and after each drag, take a sip. This will keep your throat cool, and will keep some tar from sticking to it. Ideally, your drink should be non-alcoholic and non-carbonated, preferably water or juice.; , If you take smaller drags, and hold them in for less time, you will not irritate your throat and lungs as much. Try to leave several seconds or more in between drags, to let your throat and lungs cool down.  Try to get some aerobic exercise every day, preferably before you sing. 15 minutes is okay, but 30 or more is much better. It is essential that you exercise hard enough that you are breathing hard. The longer you breath hard, the better you will sing later (within reason).  At first, you may not like smoking lights, but the improvements you notice in your voice will motivate you to stick with it. After you've been smoking them for several days, they will taste about like normal cigarettes.  If you have a smoke every hour, try waiting two or three hours, and sing a song before each cigarette. You'll start to notice that the longer you wait, the better you sing. You'll also notice that you enjoy your cigarettes more this way. You can use this to motivate you to wait longer and longer.  If all else fails and your voice hasn't improved to your satisfaction or you can't break your habits, you might want to consider taking it to the extreme and quitting altogether! You may have to choose between quitting smoking or quitting singing in the end.  

drink while you smoke.  take smaller drags.  exercise.  smoke the lightest cigarettes you can.  smoke less.  quit. 

 Making dramatic changes to your diet can affect your body in big ways. Especially if you have underlying medical conditions that can prove dangerous with fasting — diabetes for example — you should always get a doctor’s approval before undergoing a fast.   Many people fast for religious reasons rather than health, detoxification, or weight loss concerns. Rest assured, though, that most religions that call for fasting, including Islam, Catholicism, and Judaism, allow exemptions for those whose health won’t allow for it.Speak with your religious leader about your doctor’s concerns. Together, you can come up with a plan to practice your spiritual devotion without putting your health at risk.; , Although the human body can survive for weeks — in one documented case, even months! — without food, it will shut down very quickly without water.Our bodies are about 60% water, and every cell in our body needs it to function properly.Without it, most people will die within three days.Fasting can take many forms, and you might allow yourself to drink water throughout your fast. But some fasts — the Islamic fast for the month of Ramadan, for example — prohibit drinking water for long stretches of time. No matter how much water you allow during the fast, it's important to prepare your body for a long stretch of nutritional deficiency by "super-hydrating" beforehand.   Drink plenty of water regularly in the days leading up to your fast. Then, drink at least two quarts of hydrating fluids before the last meal preceding your fast. Also avoid dehydrating foods with high salt and sugar contents, like fast food or salty snacks.  Coffee, soda, tea, and all those energy drinks we drink on a daily basis all contain high amounts of caffeine. Though you may not think of it this way, caffeine is considered a mood-altering substance that can result in dependence, if not outright addiction. If you drink caffeine regularly then remove it suddenly from your diet, you will likely experience withdrawal symptoms. When you're eating a normal diet, those symptoms aren't very noticeable. But even a very short fast — a day-long fast before surgery, for example — can worsen withdrawal symptoms.The common symptoms of caffeine withdrawal include headache, fatigue, anxiety, irritability, depressed mood, and trouble concentrating.To avoid these unwanted side-effects, wean yourself off caffeine products in the weeks before you begin your fast.  If you have an addiction to tobacco products, it may be even harder to give up than caffeine. However, it's even more important to abstain from tobacco use than caffeine use. Not only will tobacco hit you harder on an empty stomach — making your head spin and potentially making you feel nauseous — it poses serious health risks. Tobacco use during a fast elevates both blood pressure and pulse rate, and decreases the skin temperature in your fingers and toes.If you're having trouble finding a way to quit, even temporarily, talk to your doctor to learn more effective strategies.  The word itself — "carbo + hydrate" — essentially means "watered carbon." Unlike proteins and fats, carbohydrates bond with water, helping your body stay hydrated for longer periods of time. This is very important when you're preparing to fast! In the days and weeks leading up to your fast, eat plenty carbohydrate-rich foods to help your body hold onto its water:Multi grain breads, pastas, and cereals Starchy vegetables (potatoes, parsnips) Vegetables (romaine lettuce, broccoli, asparagus, carrots) Fruits, (tomatoes, strawberries, apples, berries, oranges, grapes, and bananas)  , You may think that you want to stuff yourself with as much food as possible in the days leading up to the fast. After all, that should help tide you over when you're hungry, right? In fact, stuffing yourself regularly before your fast will acclimate your body to large meals. You'll feel even hungrier when you stop eating. It may also help to vary your mealtimes, so your body doesn't continue to anticipate food at specific times of the day.  Many people choose to eat a large, protein-filled meal for their last meal before the fast. After days of eating small, carbohydrate-rich meals, this last meal can make you feel more satisfied for a longer period of time and ease you into the fast.   Remember to take in a lot of hydrating fluids before your final meal to help your body get through your fast.  Hunger is a full-body, primal feeling, and can take over your mind if you let it. Obsessing over your hunger is the quickest way to letting yourself break your fast. Distract yourself by keeping yourself busy whenever possible.   Distract yourself with light, pleasant activities like talking with friends or reading a good book. You can also take this time to catch up on chores and errands you otherwise put off. When you're trying to keep your mind off hunger, vacuuming the whole house might not seem so bad! If you're fasting for religious reasons, you might take this time to think about why you're going through this process. Attend religious meetings, study your scripture, and reflect on your relationship with god.  If you are doing an "intermittent fast," in which you regularly fast every few days for short periods of time, you are most likely trying to lose weight. When you exercise a carbohydrate-depleted body, it begins burning fat to fuel itself, which may be your goal. Note, though, that it will also begin burning through protein and muscle mass. Your best bet is to exercise at a low rate instead of running yourself breathless during cardio.  People on an intermittent fast only fast for short periods of time. Although they should do less cardio, they can still exercise because they'll refuel their bodies soon. However, if you're planning to fast for a few days or more, it's best not to engage in high-energy activities. They will tire you out far more than they would when you were eating regularly. If you're fasting over a long period of time, rather than intermittently, you won't be able to refuel your body for some time.  You may feel relaxed while you sleep, but your body is hard at work taking care of itself. When you're knocked out, it gives your body time to repair muscles, form memories, and regulate both growth and appetite through hormones.When you're fasting, you may find it harder to concentrate from the lack of food. Regular naps taken during the day have been shown to improve alertness, refocus the mind, and improve moods.Make sure to get at least 8 hours of sleep every night, and nap regularly throughout the day.  Those who are fasting for spiritual reasons will find this easy. You may have friends from your place of worship who are fasting at the same time and for the same reasons. But even if you're fasting for health or detoxification, try to find a friend who will fast with you to keep you company. Being around someone who's going through the same thing will keep you from feeling alone in the experience. Hold each other accountable and motivate each other to reach your goals, whatever they may be.  Don't put yourself in situations where you'll let yourself feel sorry for yourself. Even if you're around other people who are going through the fast with you, don't let the conversation turn to all the foods you miss eating. You'll obsess over it long after the conversation is over, and you may let yourself cheat when you're alone. Instead of talking about what you're missing out on, frame your conversations around the positives: what are you getting out of this? Or, talk about something completely different, like the movie you just saw or a recent event in the news.   Until your fast is over, politely decline invitations to meals with non-fasting friends. Even if it doesn't tempt you into breaking your fast, watching other people eat will be a miserable experience.  Even if you have an accountability partner who's helping you stick to your fast, you may find yourself frustrated in ways you don't want to share with others. Keeping a journal to hold your private thoughts is a great way to both vent and record your experience for later insight. You can treat it like a normal diary about day-to-day life or focus it only on fast-related topics. Either way, your fast will likely find its way into your private thoughts.   Don't censor yourself! Even if you're fasting for religious reasons, don't feel bad about questioning whether you want to finish the fast. Just writing it down will help you confront the feeling, then flush it out of your system.  No matter how hungry you are at the end of your fast, you have to fight the urge to stuff yourself at your first opportunity. When you fast, your body adjusts to make up for the lack of food by slowing down the production of enzymes that help digestion.If you gorge immediately after a fast, your body will be overwhelmed by food it can't process, leading to stomach cramping, nausea, and vomiting.As you draw closer to the end of your fast, you should put together a plan for how to ease yourself back into a regular diet.  But if you’ve been allowing only water during your fast, juice and fruits, which have high water content, are the best way to ease your body back into a normal diet. Your stomach will have shrunk in size during your fast, so you may even find that juice and fruit can satisfy your hunger at first.  Stop eating whenever your hunger is satisfied — overeating before your body is ready to handle it can lead to digestive problems. It's best to stick to foods that have a high water content at first:   Soups and broths Vegetables Raw fruits Yogurt  , First, it prevents you from wolfing down your meals. It takes your brain about 20 minutes to process the information it's getting from the stomach and realize that your stomach is full.Eating too quickly leads to overeating, which is dangerous after a fast. The second benefit of thorough chewing is that it breaks the food up into smaller bits that will be easier for your body to digest.   Chew each bite of food about 15 times. Drink one glass of water before your meal and one glass during your meal to slow down the pace of your meal. Take a small sip between every bite of food.  Probiotics are “good bacteria” that are found naturally in the mouth, intestines, and vagina.They help your body digest food efficiently, which is something you need help with after a fast. Eat foods that have live cultures of lactobacillus; common sources are yogurts, sauerkraut, and miso.You can also take probiotic supplements in capsule, tablet, or powder form to help your body digest food better.  No matter what you read about the best way to break a fast, your body will let you know what it's ready for. If, after transitioning from fruits to vegetables, your stomach starts cramping or you feel like throwing up, don't push yourself! Go back to eating fruits and drinking juices for another meal, or even another day. Let your body progress at its own pace. Eventually, you can work back up to harder-to-digest foods and larger meals without feeling any negative side effects.  

visit a doctor before beginning your fast.  hydrate well before the fast.  limit your caffeine intake.  limit your tobacco use.  eat carbohydrate-rich foods.  control your portion sizes.  eat a large meal before the fast, but don't overeat.  keep yourself busy.  lower your exercise load if you’re on an intermittent fast.depending on your reason for fasting and the nature of your fast, high-energy activities may help or hurt your cause.  avoid high-energy activities if you’re on a long-term fast.  get plenty of rest.  spend time with other people who are fasting.  avoid talking about food.  keep a fasting journal.  have a plan for breaking your fast.  drink juice and eat fruit to come off a water fast.obviously, if you’ve been on a juice fast, drinking more juice isn’t really “breaking” your fast.  ease into very small meals.rather than sitting down to a lavish feast to celebrate the end of the fast, eat snacks or small meals throughout the day.  chew food thoroughly.chewing your food well serves two purposes when you're breaking a fast.  introduce probiotics into your system.  listen to your body. 

 There are two basic types of shin guards. One type has attached ankle straps, which wrap under the foot and provides support and ankle protection. The other type simply slides under your socks and protect just your shins. For players under 12 the added ankle support is crucial for safety and comfort.Currently, there are some hybrid guards that come down to cover the ankle but don't actually wrap around it. These tend to be more expensive, however, as they need a very precise fit.; , As players grow more serious about soccer, they tend to find the ankle-guards too bulky, as they can limit your foot's range of motion. By ages 10-12, many youth players switch to slide-ins, which you simply push under the socks. They do not cover your ankles. While slightly less protective, the added speed is essential for higher levels of competition.  Shin guards come in the standard sizes from x-small all the way to XL, but just because you wear a large jersey doesn't mean you need a large guard. For the most part, let height be your guide:    Small: 0 - 5'2" (0 - 160cm)  Medium: 5'2" - 5'10" (160cm - 180cm)  Large: 5'10" - 6'4" (180cm - 195cm)  X-Large: 6'4" + (195cm and up), While the guide above is best for 90% of players, everyone is different. As a rule of thumb, you want the guard to cover from below the knee to right before your ankle bends.  Professional players actually have guards that are custom-molded to their shins. While this is overkill for youth soccer, the basic idea is a good one -- you want snug, complete protection around your shins. When looking at your legs from the front, the shinguard should cover the entire width of your leg.   Most shin guards can be lightly bent with your fingers to curve them to your leg. Do not yank on them, however, as this can cause them to weaken., The best way to buy guards is to see what feels comfortable. When going to the store, bring a pair of long soccer socks with you. Slide the guards on and walk around a bit, even jogging if possible, and see if they stay snugly in place. They should be comfortable and cover the majority of your leg.  

choose shin guards with attached ankle protection for players 12 years old and under.  consider slide-in shin guards for older players.  size shin guards based on your height.  ensure the guard protects a few inches under the knee to just above the ankle.  get a guard that comfortably molds to the width of your leg.  try on shin guards with a soccer sock before buying. 

; , Use the swirl pattern for the best effect.  A ring (maybe put it on when they tell you to) A jamaaliday bow- white preferably. Maybe even a white mysterious cloak.  When it's time to say your vows, say some romantic lines about how much you love your guy. For example: "When I saw you, I knew you were my prince. Now that I'm marrying you, I know I'm going to be happy. I love you so much." If AJ doesn't let you say this, try something else.  This shows your love.  Or, if you have free chat, say, 'o3o' or 'u3u'.  Dance and talk to people. It's simple! Maybe even pretend to take photos or kiss the groom a couple of times. Don't be rude or anything, though. And don't get too kissy or else it will annoy other players.  It's just kind! Give a special thank you to the bridesmaids and the flower girl and stuff, because they took a big part in the wedding.  Get heart flowers or chocolate roses, and place them somewhere in the crowd. If it's not your den, ask the person who owns the den to do it in a JAG.  

choose the colours white, light yellow, light pink, light grey and maybe dark grey.  have your normal eyes, but make sure they're pretty.  wear these clothes:  a flower crown- white preferably.  say your vows.  use the three hearts emote at random times during the wedding.  when it's time for you to kiss, use the 'lovestruck' emote.  hold a reception.  thank people for attending your wedding.  throw the bouquet. 

 This method is a simple way to dress up a plain pair of flip flops or dress sandals. Here's a list of what you will need:Flip flops or sandals 1 – 1 ½ inch (2.54 – 3.81 centimeter) wide chiffon/fabric flowers Felt (matching flower color) Scissors Fabric glue  , You can find them in fabric stores, usually in the ribbons and trims section, or on bolts of fabric in the special occasion fabrics section. They will usually come on some fabric netting. You want them to be between 1 – 1 ½ inch (2.54 – 3.81 centimeter) wide. If you have very small shoes or feet, you might want to go for something even smaller. You can also include one or two larger flowers to use as a focal point.  The more delicate your flowers look, the better. If you aren't certain what color to choose, get a color that already matches your flip flops or sandals. You can also go with a contrasting color. Do not use fake flowers that come on a stem for this project. Not only will the stem poke you in the foot, but the flowers will look cheap and unprofessional.  You may notice that the flowers have been stitched onto the netting. You will need to cut them out. This way, you can rearrange them as you like. Try to cut the flowers as close to the base as possible so that, when you look down at the flowers, you do not see any of the netting. Be careful not to cut this thread, or the flowers may fall apart.  If you accidentally snip a thread, then glue it to the back of the flower with a small drop of glue.  This will allow you to experiment with different designs before you glue them down onto the straps. Once you glue the flowers down, you don't be able to take them off without ruining them (and possibly your shoes too). Whatever design you choose, make sure that it will fit on the straps. Here are some design ideas:  Place the larger flowers towards the center, and the smaller towards the ends. If you are decorating a flip flop, consider placing the larger flowers on the outside strap and the smaller flowers on the inside strap. Alternate the flower colors or shades. For example, you can alternate between white and teal. You can also alternate between light pink and dark pink. If you are decorating a pair of sandals, you may have two straps: an ankle strap and a wide strap that goes across your toes. Consider placing the flowers on the toe strap and leaving the ankle strap untouched. If you are decorating a sandal that has a T strap, then put the flowers only on the vertical strap; leave the ankle straps untouched.  You will be using the felt circles later. Try to choose a color that closely matches the color of the flowers. If you are having troubles getting the shape or size right, trace the flowers onto the felt using a pen first, then cut a little bit inside the lines.  If you are gluing flowers to a T strap, consider cutting out a felt rectangle that is just a little bit wider than the vertical strap.  Put the fabric glue onto the straps first. The flowers are likely going to be a little bit wider than the straps. If you put the glue onto the flowers first, you might end up putting on too much glue., You will be working with one felt circle at a time so that the glue does not dry out., You will be sandwiching the strap between the flower and the felt circle. Use your fingers to press the sides of the circle to the sides of the flower., The felt circles will help hold the flowers to the strap. They will also hide the glue and make the back of the flowers less scratchy., Just because the glue feels dry does not necessarily mean that it is fully cured. If you wear the shoes too soon, they glue may not hold, and the flowers may fall off. Refer to the label on your glue bottle for precise drying and curing times. Every brand of glue is different. Your shoes may be ready to wear in as little as two hours. They may also require a full day to dry. 

gather your supplies.  choose your chiffon or fabric flowers.  cut the flowers out of the fabric netting.  arrange the flowers how you like on the table first.  cut circles out of felt that are a little bit smaller than the flowers and set them aside.  start gluing the flowers down onto the straps.  take a felt circle and draw a spiral of fabric glue onto the back.  place the felt circle against the back of the flower.  glue the rest of the felt circles against the backs of the flowers.  allow the glue to dry and cure completely before you were the shoes. 

 Wood is harvested from trees, and planks can be made from the wood using the crafting table. Wood is a great basic material because it is cheap and easy to find in many biomes.; , Stone is a common block, largely found underground and making up mountains. If mined using pickaxe, you can get cobblestone instead, which looks slightly different.   You can even make a basic stone generator (using glass, lava, and water), if you don't feel like mining for stone or cobblestone.  Quartz comes from building a Nether Reactor in Minecraft PE. This makes the blocks expensive in Survival Mode, but if you want to bring some white color into your buildings, it's the best way.  Sand is a common natural block, usually found near water or in desert biomes. This is an easy way to add beige into your color scheme and it's cheap if you're not wanting to invest too much time.  Coal is a material that you'll have to mine, but it's pretty common. This is the easiest way to bring black into your color scheme. Remember that you'll have to smelt the coal from ore, and the original blocks look very much like spotted cobblestone. Don't miss them!  , You can build a basic house that resembles your real life home or any cliché looking house. Using stairs to make a roof and avoiding pure box shapes can help a lot in making even a basic house look really nice.  Using cobblestone or regular stone, make yourself a castle complete with dungeon. You can even use Green wool to make yourself a giant dragon to slay! Look at pictures of real medieval castles to get ideas on the layout you want.   Fences are useful for making turrets at the tops of towers.  Using a few tricks, you can make an underwater house in Minecraft PE. Simply build the walls up to the water's surface, fill the inside with dirt, seal the house, and then remove the dirt.  Flex your creativity and create a super modern house. You can use the clean box lines and walls of glass panes to create a very cool looking house. These look great perched on a cliff.  Bring out the "mine" in Minecraft and build yourself a Bat Cave. You can even include a waterfall entrance. Batmobile not included...unless you build that too.   Building a mansion over the cave can add even more fun. Use redstone or other clever tricks (command blocks, if you hack your game) to make things like an elevator that takes you down to the cave.  Build a giant tree and then make yourself a house that either hugs around the trunk and branches or actually fits inside the trunk itself. You can even make a whole village this way and use it to hang out with your friends.  Use quartz and column blocks to make a cool Roman palace. You can even build a temple to yourself inside! Don't forget a pool out front and a road lined with Cypress trees to seal the deal!  , It's not a small building project by any means, but who wouldn't want to have their own Hogwarts to have adventures in. Make classrooms, the Great Hall, your house's dorm, the greenhouse, the library, and any other parts of the castle you can't live without. Don't forget the lake out front and the Quidditch pitch!  , Build a skyscraper and fill it with apartments. You can use mods to add command blocks and use the command block to build an elevator that takes you to your apartment. You don't have to fill out every apartment of course. Maybe a few for your friends...but save the penthouse for yourself!  , Build yourself a pirate ship and live aboard! Remember that the bigger you make the boat, the more detail you can create. Just be careful not to get scurvy!   Glass panes make good sails for a pirate ship.  Use different colored blocks to mark the different parts of your foundation. For example, use blue wool to mark the corners of your walls and red wool to mark the locations for redstone circuits. Place these blocks in the first ground layer so that you can build right on top of them. This lets you make sure that everything is lined up and can also help you figure out how much material you need.  Build houses using materials that you can easily gather. Otherwise, be ready to invest in a long project. This can be fun though! Just play in a way that's fun for you.  Always, always, always build the exterior walls first. This is often the hardest part of building, so getting it done first will help keep you motivated to finish. It's also important for keeping everything lined up and looking good. This is how real life building works too!   Building the exterior first also has the added benefit of letting you get the ceilings up, which means you get to stay out of the rain and snow.  You can really build a cool house in just about any shape you want. All you have to do to make it cool is make it not boring! You can do this by avoiding blocky overall shapes to your house (having one giant square or rectangle) and also by avoiding too-flat walls. Use outcroppings, towers, and wings to make your house more interesting. You should also break up the colors of the outside walls and ceiling. Having everything in just one color makes it look like a blob!  , Another key part of making a house interesting is to make sure that you don't neglect the landscaping. A cool house in the middle of a completely empty plain is pretty boring. Make any house more interesting by adding a garden, lake, street, or other decorations to keep the environment looking cool.  You can find a number of pre-made building plans online, showing you exactly how to make all sorts of different buildings yourself. This is great for beginners, who haven't gotten used to the materials available to them yet.    Minecraft Building Inc is one great example.  There are a couple of sites on the net that will let you create your own building plans, drawing out exactly what materials should go where. The most common site for this is MineDraft.  There are loads of videos on YouTube that show you how to build cool houses and other fun structures. Spend some time exploring and getting ideas for what other people have made.

 Pounds are the U.S. standard unit for measuring mass or weight.Most standard scales in the U.S. will weigh you in pounds, including scales at your doctor’s office, and personal scales you can buy.  For example, you might weigh 165 pounds. ; , One stone is equal to 14 pounds. So dividing pounds by 14 will give you your weight in stones. For example, 16514=11.79{\displaystyle {\frac {165}{14}}=11.79}. So, 165 pounds is about 12 stone. Specifically, it is 11 stone, 11 pounds, since 165 divided by 14 is 11, with a remainder of 11.  To do this, you need to do the opposite of what you would do to convert pounds to stones. That means you need to multiply the number of stones by 14. If the weight is given in the number of stones and pounds, multiply the number of stones by 14, and add the pounds to the product. Otherwise, just multiply the whole number or decimal by 14.  For example, to convert 10 stone, 8 pounds, you would calculate:10×14+8{\displaystyle 10\times 14+8}=140+8{\displaystyle =140+8}=148{\displaystyle =148}So, 10 stone, 8 pounds is equal to 148 pounds.   

find your weight in pounds.  divide your weight in pounds by 14.  convert stones to pounds. 

 If you want to get your kitten spayed or neutered when it is two months old, then look for signs that it is that age. In general, a kitten that is two months old should weigh approximately two pounds, as long as it has had proper nutrition and care.Two pounds is the weight that is required for your kitten to get desexing surgery. Any lighter than that and the veterinarian performing the surgery may be worried about the kitten's ability to survive the surgery.  If you are not sure how old your kitten is, you can estimate its age by assessing its physical characteristics. Newborn kittens have closed eyes and ears that are tucked against their heads. These clues signal that you have a kitten that it only a few weeks old.However, if your kitten has open eyes and popped up ears but tiny baby teeth, then it is between one and three months old. A cat that it getting, or already has, its adult teeth is at least four months old.  A two month old kitten should be fully weaned from its mother. If your kitten is still nursing, then it is probably not yet two months old. If you notice the kitten's mother trying to wean the kitten, for example not letting it nurse, then the kitten is probably between one and one and a half months old.Kittens that are two months old are also working on their paw and eye coordination. If a kitten is playing a lot with toys and getting more daring, then it is probably at least two months old.  

weigh your kitten.  look for physical clues about age.  assess your kitten's development. 

 If you already speak English or any language with a Latinate script, you may think you already have the alphabet down. But language is constantly evolving and while most things are the same, there are a few differences.J, V, and W don't exist. Well, not really at least. There were 23 letters in the classic Latin alphabet. R is rolled, similar to the trill in Spanish. Y is known as "i Graeca" ("Greek i") and Z is "zeta." I can sometimes be pronounced as the english Y sound and Y is pronounced like the French "u."  If you know the IPA, that means the letter I is sometimes pronounced as /j/ and the letter Y is sometimes pronounced as /y/. See the reasoning?   U is sometimes similar to a W -- in fact, that's where the letter comes from. It's written as "v."; , While pronouncing Latin doesn't offer near as many trip ups as English does (generally, each letter sticks to a sound), there are a couple of things to keep in mind: length and combinations.   An apex (´) or acute accent (like the accent aigu in French) is used to denote long vowels. With one, "a" becomes like the sound in "father" instead of the sound in "hat." "E" alone is "bed," but with the apex it's more like the sound in "café."  Unfortunately, modern Latin spelling has made this very confusing by using the macron (¯) to denote length of vowels, too, when it's normally used to denote long syllables. Now it seems noting syllable and vowel length is a free-for-all and most dictionaries don't do it sufficiently. And to make matters worse, Spanish uses the same symbol to denote accented syllables. But if you find yourself in Italy and you squint a little bit, you should notice the apexes on Roman inscriptions (at least from classical and postclassical times) in all their rightful glory.Different vowel/consonant combinations can change the sound of the letters. "Ae" becomes the sound in "kite" (or /ai/); "ch" makes a "k" sound; "ei" makes the sound in "day" (/ei/); "eu" sounds like "ee-ooo"; "oe" is the same as the sound in "toy."  If you know the IPA, this all becomes a lot easier -- there are tons of similarities. Needless to say, the IPA is Latin-derived., English has a lot of Latin roots and therefore shares some of the same emphasis patterns. However, it'd be ridiculous to say anything applies 100% in the current Lingua Franca. For Latin, keep these rules in mind:   For one syllable words, well, emphasis isn't an issue. For two syllable words, emphasize the first syllable (pos-co: I demand) For polysyllabic words, emphasis goes on the penultimate syllable if it's heavy or long (mentiuntur: they lie). For polysyllabic words that have a light or short syllable penultimately, the emphasis goes on the antipenultimate syllable (imperator: commander).  All these rules are similar to this day in English. In fact, English long considered Latin's rules as the "right" way to speak and changed Germanic roots to fit in this box. It's the same reason your English teacher tells you to not split infinitives (did you catch that?). The reasoning is Latin (and now archaic).  If you don't already have a sense of this, Latin is a very complicated language. You're about to embark upon a long, uphill battle. Here's an example: verbs have to consider a few things, right? Maybe plurality, person, and tense? Nope. Way more. But you can handle it, right? The Latin verbs must take the following things into consideration:Three persons -- first, second, and third Two aspects -- perfect (finished) and imperfect (unfinished) Two numbers -- singular and plural Three moods -- indicative, subjunctive, and imperative Six tenses -- present, imperfect, future, perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect Two voices -- active and passive. Four non-finite forms -- infinitive, gerund, participle, and supine  Have we mentioned yet that there are 7 cases and 3 genders for nouns?    

familiarize yourself with the alphabet.  get the pronunciation down.  know where the emphasis goes.  know what you're in for. 

 Before you begin swinging your toddler, make sure the area is clear of other children. Additionally, make sure older children know not to start swinging until the front and back area of the swing set is clear of children.While your toddler is young, help them become aware of moving swings and the dangers of standing too close. Let them know that if they stand too close to a moving swing they may get hurt.  When you place your child in the swing, also place their hands around the swing's straps. Tell them to hold onto the straps tightly at all times.If you see your toddler let go of the straps while you are swinging them, then stop the swing immediately and place their hands around the straps again. Let them know that you cannot resume swinging until they are holding onto the straps.  While your child is a toddler, you should always be nearby when they are swinging or playing on the swing set. This way you can prevent accidents from happening, as well as socialize them on the appropriate swing set behavior.  Try to place the swing set in an area that it is visible from your living room or kitchen window. This way, you can supervise your children from afar once they are old enough to play on the swing set by themselves.  

make sure the area is clear.  teach your toddler to hold onto the swing's straps at all times.  supervise your toddler at all times. 

 You don’t have to look like you’ve stepped off the runway, but you should take pride in your appearance when you’re planning to ask out a confident girl. That’s because she likely makes an effort to look good, and will expect the same from a potential date.Take care of all basic grooming habits, so you appear clean and neat when you talk to her. You don’t have to wear the most expensive, trendy clothes, but your outfit should be clean and fit well.; , A confident girl is usually going to want you to be confident as well, so you can’t wait for her to talk to you. Show her that you have plenty of your own confidence by having the guts to walk up to her and start a conversation.If you’re having trouble working up the confidence to approach a girl, try to do it in a situation where she’s more likely to be receptive, such as at a party or bar. In most cases, she’s more likely to be friendly when she’s in a social setting. Remember to smile and maintain eye contact when you go to talk to her. If you keep your eyes down and fidget, she’s going to know that you’re nervous.  Confident girls are direct themselves, so that’s what they typically want in their partners. That means you shouldn’t come up with some lame excuse for approaching her, such as pretending that you need directions or her advice on what to get your friend’s girlfriend for her birthday. Instead, make it clear from the start that you’re interested in her and want to make a connection.If you haven’t been formally introduced, you might go up to her and say, “I saw you across the room and had to come over and introduce myself.” If you already know each other, you can approach her and say, “I’ve been thinking about you ever since the last time we talked.” You can also try offering up a compliment that makes your interest clear, such as “You know, your smile lights up the room,” or “You’re the most beautiful girl in the room, hands down.”  , A confident girl is going to want to know that you’re genuinely interested in her and who she is, so you shouldn’t necessarily ask her out right after you approach her. Instead, start a conversation to get to know her better. Avoid simple yes or no questions that can slow down a chat. Open-ended questions are a better option because they give her an opportunity to really express herself.If she’s in school, you might ask her what her favorite classes are and why. If she’s a frequent traveler, you might ask her to recommend some can’t-miss destinations. Pay attention to what she says, and use it to build off of to keep the conversation going. For example, if she mentions that she’s a big football fan, you can tell her about the big game that you went to last weekend.  Once you’ve gotten to know each other a little, it’s time to ask for a date. Don’t be vague -- asking “Would you maybe like to go out sometime?” isn’t going to impress a confident girl. Instead, make a concrete offer, such as “Would you like to get together tomorrow night?”It’s best not to make your first date something formal like dinner. Instead, go for something casual, such as grabbing a cup of coffee or a walk through a local park. That will keep things relaxed and low-key.  While trying to make her jealous by mentioning your ex or flirting with other girls on social media may seem like a good way to get her attention, a confident girl isn’t going to feel threatened by other girls. In fact, she’s more likely to be annoyed so the ploy will probably backfire on you anyway.It’s inevitable that past relationships will come up in conversation when you’re dating someone -- and that’s okay. It only becomes a problem if you’re trying to use your ex to get a rise out of your current girlfriend.  Because she doesn’t usually get jealous or irrational, a confident girl isn’t going to understand if you do. Don’t try to go through her phone when she’s not looking or guess her social media passwords so you can go through her accounts. Instead, try to be confident in your relationship and trust your girlfriend.If you’re concerned that there is a problem in your relationship, such as her relationship with an ex, just ask her about it. She’ll appreciate the direct approach, and is more likely to be honest with you.  When it comes to making decisions in the relationship, a confident girl isn’t going to want to do all the work herself. She’s going to expect you to know what you want and be able to express that clearly.Even when it comes to a simple decision, such as where you should go for dinner, don’t say, “I don’t know” or “I don’t care.” Offer up a concrete suggestion, so the two of you can make a decision together.  Just because a girl is confident doesn’t mean that she doesn’t like to hear about her strengths from other people sometimes, so don’t let those things go unsaid. Be supportive and tell her about the things you like best about her on a regular basis.Don’t limit your compliments to her physical appearance. Sure, she’ll appreciate hearing that she’s pretty, but she likely wants to be valued as a complete person. Compliment her intelligence, strength, kindness, and other positive qualities as often as you tell her that she looks beautiful in a certain dress.  If you’re both strong, confident individuals, then you’re going to disagree sometimes. That’s actually part of a healthy relationship because differences of opinion allow you to learn from one another. The key is to focus on the issues that you disagree on and not attack each other. When you’re frustrated, it can be easy to resort to name-calling and low blows. Do your best to avoid sinking to that level because a confident girl probably isn’t going tolerate that kind of behavior. Keep your tone of voice in mind. If you’re yelling to try to get your point across, chances are your girlfriend isn’t going to hear you. However, if you maintain a calm, even tone as you explain your feelings, she’s much more likely to take what you’re saying to heart.  A confident girl is probably going to be able to express herself pretty well, so she’ll have no trouble telling you how she feels or what she thinks about your relationship. For a healthy, balanced relationship, you’ll need to do the same and tell the truth about how you feel. She doesn’t want to have to guess how you feel about her or how committed you are to the relationship.You have to be willing to open up to her even if you aren’t sure how she’ll react. Holding in your feelings may only lead to bigger problems down the road. If you’re feeling like your relationship isn’t a priority for her or she doesn’t value your opinion, tell her. She may not be aware that she’s making you feel that way, so the only way to be certain is to express your feelings. If it turns out that she isn’t as committed to the relationship as you are, you’re better off knowing that, so you can decide whether you should move on.  Being a good listener is part of developing effective communication skills, which means you shouldn’t interrupt or talk over her. She's going to want a partner who takes her feelings and opinions seriously, and you can't do that if you don't hear what she's saying. If you’re having trouble really processing what she’s saying, try rephrasing what she’s just said in your own words to ensure that you’re listening and understanding what she’s telling you., A confident girl doesn’t have a problem owning up to her mistakes, so she’s going to expect the same from you. If you’ve hurt her feelings or forgotten about a date, apologize and try to learn from the mistake., In a relationship between two strong, confident people, give and take is a necessity. If you make small concessions for her in a conflict or disagreement, it’s more likely that she’ll do the same for you, so both of you can feel like you have an equal say in the relationship.Don’t keep score. Not all compromises mean that you’re meeting in the middle. In some cases, you might have to concede more than she does and vice versa. If you compromise a little more than her on what to do on Friday night, that doesn’t mean that she “owes” you the next time you disagree. The goal is to find a solution that makes both of you as happy as possible on a case by case basis.  

make a good first impression.  approach her.  be direct.  be curious.  ask her out.  don’t play games.  control your insecurities.  be decisive.  offer compliments.  don’t be afraid of conflict.  be honest.  listen carefully.  admit when you’re wrong.  try to compromise. 

 Add the blended mixture to a saucepan and boil for a few minutes just to dissolve the sugar particles.; , Just before you turn the stove off, add the powdered milk and mix through thoroughly.

 While aloe vera gels and sprays are available, using the pulp directly from a leaf offers the best results. Dab it onto the affected area and let sit for a half hour or more, then rinse with cool water. Repeat if necessary or desired.If you go with a store bought product, check its label for alcohol. Avoid using alcohol-based products as they will dry out your skin, causing further irritation.  Consider using tea tree oil either on its own or blended with a skin product. Apply enough oil to saturate the the area you shaved immediately after hair removal. You can also add several drops of tea tree oil to the moisturizer or balm you use after shaving.

Diluting with essential oils is not recommended., Rub a small amount of coconut oil onto your irritated skin. If you’re not planning on rinsing, use an amount small enough for your skin to absorb. Alternatively, you can apply a thin coating, leave it on for about a half hour, then rinse with lukewarm water.If you leave coconut oil on your skin, be careful about coming into contact with clothes or furniture fabric, since it can leave tough to remove stains., Apply directly to your skin and let it sit for about ten minutes.

 If you get out first, it will be harder to do the next step. Same goes for if you get out last. You want to get out in the middle so you can blend in easier.  The teacher will pay attention to them when they get done with a set of exercises which will allow you enough time to look like you're done.  He can't say you never did them when he didn't see you not doing them.  For example: volleyball, capture the flag (just stand there and say you're playing defence), soccer (stand by the goal and, like in capture the flag, say you're playing defence.)  , Tell the person behind you that they can go ahead of you, in which case they will say "You sure?", and you can smile and say yes.  

after you change into your gym clothes, never get out of the locker room first.  if you have warm ups, wait until the more fit kids get done, then go a few seconds after.  only do the warm ups when the teacher is looking that way.  if you can, pick sports where you can stand there and look like you're doing something.  if you're playing baseball or something where you will be standing in line to wait for your turn to bat or what not, use politeness to your advantage. 

 It's also best not to participate in combat if you're planning to complete the bar crawl in one sitting, as your skill ability will drop significantly.; , Using a Games Necklace is the fastest method.

 If there's anything labrador retrievers love more than food, it is spending time with you - playing, snuggling, or simply following you around..   Don’t neglect your lab if it wants to play or cuddle up next to your feet while you watch TV. Your labrador retriever has not lost its pack instinct. Most likely, your lab views you as the leader or one of the leaders of its pack. So if you neglect your lab, it will be affected emotionally.  All dogs are territorial. Your lab is no exception. It's natural for them to bark at anything and everything, but when conditioned properly, they aren't so ferocious. Make sure that you spend some time at home and out in public training your lab.If you have several dogs, you'll need to gradually introduce your new labrador retriever into the mix. Place them in a room or outdoor space divided by a fence of some kind. Let the dogs get a sense of one another. They learn a lot by smells, so give them 30 minutes or more to just take in their new companion. Next, let them get closer, but keep them on a leash. Do this several times, limiting their exposure to the other animal to half hour increments. Only when you are confident that they won't attack one another should you let them roam freely. Have them play together outside. Let them bond.The same rules apply to people. If your labrador retriever is going to get used to being around a lot of people, it needs to be introduced into these environments in a safe way. Keep your lab on a leash. Have surrounding people/strangers pet your dog and be kind to them. Tell them to offer their hand to your dog. Dogs love to smell people's hands in order to assess their scent. Do this frequently. Eventually, your lab will learn that people can be trusted., Generally, your labrador retriever will play well with children. However, if you have younger children, you will have to keep tabs on what they're doing with the dog at all times. Make sure the child isn't hurting or threatening your dog in any way or this may result in a physical altercation. Your dog isn't vicious. It doesn't hate your child. It might just feel threatened by it. If it scratches or bites, it is simply reacting instinctually to a threat. Do your best to limit this threat. Be present when your child plays with your labrador., Typically, your lab's favorite toy will be a tennis ball. This probably speaks to their inner "retriever". Since your lab was bred to fetch wild game, it makes sense that it would enjoy playing with something that is meant to be retrieved. You can find a myriad of other toys at any pet superstore. Dog toys are a great way for your dog to play and to burn off excess energy without having to go outside and run around., Teach it how to walk on a leash also. Labrador retrievers are an intelligent breed and are often easy to train - especially, when they are younger. A trained dog is more confident and better behaved. In addition, a dog that will listen to voice commands is safer in the event it is ever off-leash.When training your labrador retriever, be sure to reinforce positive behavior rather than chastise for negative. Never hit your labrador retriever. You are trying to build a trusting relationship with your dog, not create a neurotic and scared animal. Dogs that attack people or children without heed are often the product of cruel environments. Don't let your labrador retriever be one of them. 

show your lab a lot of affection.by nature, it is a very loving dog.  socialize your labrador retriever.  teach your children how to play with your lab.  supply your lab with plenty of toys.  teach your lab basic commands like sit, stay, and come. 

 What you choose to make your carrier from should depend on personal tastes and what you have available. Obviously a very old t-shirt might be a bit too stretched out to be safe, but one that has been worn a few times should still be perfectly fine. /images/thumb/3/3f/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-1.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-1.jpg /images/thumb/3/3f/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-1.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-1.jpg          Cotton tees are a good choice because they are soft against the baby's skin and they tend to be more breathable. Be aware of your baby's skin, especially if it is very sensitive. Try to avoid using the hems of the t-shirts if possible. If you buy new tees be sure to wash them first, especially if they are dark or brightly colored as the dye can transfer.; , The yarn that you use should be strong enough to securely hold the loops together, plus support the weight of the baby. A yarn that will not stretch or pill is important for added security. /images/thumb/e/e9/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-2.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-2.jpg /images/thumb/e/e9/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-2.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-2.jpg          You have the option of using other materials such as twine here, but do cover it with something to prevent scratching or irritating the baby's skin. You can use an extra scrap of the discarded t-shirt parts to make a cover by simply snipping off a piece, folding it in half so that the raw edges are not showing and then tying it around the yarn or twine. This also can be done for pure aesthetic purposes as well.  All that you will need for this project are: three t-shirts, one piece of yarn and a pair of scissors. The t-shirts should be pre-washed if they are new and should be in your regular size or perhaps, one size up. /images/thumb/4/4b/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-3.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-3.jpg /images/thumb/4/4b/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-3.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-3.jpg          Do not think that you need to make the carrier too big, because the material will relax slightly and this will make the carrier too large for safety.  This will give you three fabric tubes. Save the top portions for other projects if you are so inclined. /images/thumb/8/8b/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-4.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-4.jpg /images/thumb/8/8b/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-4.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-4.jpg         , If you are standing over top of your workspace you should be looking at two oval (or circular) shapes very close together. /images/thumb/3/37/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-5.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-5.jpg /images/thumb/3/37/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-5.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-5.jpg          This is the step where the yarn will come in - gather the yarn around both tubes, going up and through the middle so that when they are tied the two form what will look like a figure eight. Tie the yarn several times so that it is very secure and then cut off the excess.  With your scissors cut from the top, left hand corner and then diagonally to the bottom right hand corner, but only through the top part of the tube. What you will end up with is a wide piece with two narrow flaps in front. /images/thumb/d/dc/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-6.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-6.jpg /images/thumb/d/dc/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-6.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-6.jpg          This may sound confusing at first, but it is really quite simple. With the tube laid flat you have a top and a bottom part. The bottom part will be the part which is laying on the surface you are working from. Only cut the top part diagonally across, cutting from top to bottom.  Let them fall to your waist. The tied section should form an X and this part will be on your back to help distribute weight and make the carrier more stable and more comfortable. /images/thumb/4/4d/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-7.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-7.jpg /images/thumb/4/4d/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-7.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-7.jpg         , /images/thumb/1/12/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-8.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-8.jpg /images/thumb/1/12/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-8.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-8.jpg          This is one of the reasons that using different colored t-shirts is suggested - this way, you know that you have the blue loop (for instance) on your left shoulder and the red one on the right shoulder.  Take the baby and slide him down your chest and then place one leg into each loop. Make sure that both legs are not in the same loop. Once his legs are in the proper place you should spread out the material to give him support and to prevent painful bunching. /images/thumb/c/c6/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-9.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-9.jpg /images/thumb/c/c6/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-9.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-9.jpg         , While the carrier is a great way to carry your baby, you'll need to be sure that you have positioned him correctly. Until he is six months old or so, you will want the baby to face inward rather than outward to prevent problems with the hip. Follow these positioning tips: /images/thumb/6/69/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-10.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-10.jpg /images/thumb/6/69/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-10.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-10.jpg          The baby should appear to be “seated” with his knees coming just above his bottom and comfortably bent. You can tell if the baby is in the proper position on your chest if you can bend and kiss his head without strain. The baby’s knees should be wide apart instead of forced inward. A good carrier keeps the hips and knees spread and supports the thighs., Take the third t-shirt piece and wrap the widest part (the back side of the tube) around the baby’s bottom and lower back area. Wrap the two flaps around your own waist and tie them securely to help support the baby. /images/thumb/3/3b/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-11.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-11.jpg /images/thumb/3/3b/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-11.jpg/v4-300px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-11.jpg          This will also provide some additional support for your own lower back and should make the carrier much more comfortable to wear. Again, spread out the material to prevent bunching. Now you are ready to go with your easy, no-sew baby wrap carrier.  

choose the right t-shirts.  pick out your yarn.  gather your supplies.  cut all three t-shirts armpit to armpit, directly across.  take two of the tubes and tie them together in one spot, end to end.  lay the third fabric tube out flat.  take the tied loops and put them both over your head.  take one loop and place it over your arm and up to your shoulder and then repeat with the other loop to the other side.  place your baby in the carrier.  position your baby correctly.  use the third t-shirt piece to secure your baby’s bottom. 

 It’s important to keep the goals you set in mind if you want to reduce your alcohol consumption. You can help yourself stick to these goals by setting ground rules that will guide your behavior whenever you’re in a situation where you may encounter alcohol. Every drinker's rules are different, and you have to find what works for you. Some guidance rules that might help the binge drinker become more casual include:   Never drink before parties or other social gatherings (i.e., no “pre-gaming”) Never drink more than the “low risk” guidelines set by National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism:For women: no more than 3 drinks on a single day, and never more than 7 drinks per week For men: no more than 4 drinks on a single day, and never more than 14 drinks per week   Only drink with other people, not by yourself Stick to the limit goals you set for yourself (e.g., “only 2 beers on Saturday”) Avoid drinking with others who binge-drink or have problems with alcohol Never drink to relieve stress  , The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has set standards for what counts as “one drink,” which will contain roughly 14 grams of alcohol. However, many people have no idea what a standard drink looks like. If you don’t know what 5 ounces of wine looks like, use a measuring cup with colored water to get a sense. Remember that the alcohol-by-volume (ABV) level determines what counts as “one drink,” so if you regularly drink things like “high-gravity” beer (which often has ABV ranges from 6-9%, but can be as high as 12%)calculate how much you’ve had by the alcohol content. One drink counts as:   12 ounces of regular beer or cider (5% ABV) 8-9 ounces of malt liquor (7% ABV) 5 ounces of wine (12% ABV) 1.5 ounces (1 shot) of hard liquor (80 proof)  , If you become quickly intoxicated and end up slamming back a bunch of drinks to ease your nerves, or if you're just a "thirsty drinker," it can be very helpful to slow down and make each drink last longer. You will enjoy the taste of your drink more, and you will have fewer drinks over the space of your socializing.Aim to have no more than one drink per hour, depending on your tolerance. (For example, men can often drink more than women before they feel the effects of alcohol.) Use a straw to sip cocktails. It will take you longer to drink them this way. If you’re used to ordering pints, order a half pint instead. Sip it slowly rather than chugging it down. Order your drink “on the rocks.” As the ice melts, it will dilute the drink. You’ll end up taking longer to finish it, and you’ll get a little extra water.Your body absorbs alcohol into your bloodstream much faster than you can metabolize it. The quicker you drink, the more time that alcohol spends buzzing around your body, doing damage that you’ll really regret during next morning’s hangover., A big reason for continuously drinking from whatever is in front of you is lack of activity and sitting or standing next to a drink. What else are you inclined to do if you are not moving about or participating in something? Dancing, talking, playing pool or darts, etc. can all keep you occupied over and above the drinking. Once you remove alcohol as the focus, you're less likely to drink as much.   Have a plan made in advance for what you will do if you can’t find something to keep you busy. For example, if you can’t distract yourself, determine whether you will politely excuse yourself and leave, find someone to chat with, or do something else to take your mind off drinking., Alcohol is a diuretic, meaning it dehydrates you. Your body can expel four times as much liquid as you consume in an alcoholic beverage.Drinking water will also mean that your alcohol consumption slows way down. The added hydration cuts down your chance of having a hangover the next morning, too.   For example, if you have a cocktail that has 2 ounces of alcohol, drink at least an 8-ounce glass of water before you have another alcoholic drink. Try a “spacer” beverage between alcoholic drinks. Sipping a club soda or Coke between alcoholic beverages forces you to go more slowly, while giving you something to drink and fiddle with., "Going out for drinks" is a loaded proposition, because it means that you basically have to drink. It's what you went out for, after all. But, if you only allow yourself to drink with meals, it'll mean you can still enjoy the ritual of going out to bars and restaurants with friends, but with a limit on it for the length of a meal. Have a glass or two of wine with dinner, or drink a beer with your BBQ, but call it a night when your plate is clean.Drinking on an empty stomach makes a hangover much more likely. Eating a healthy meal before or during drinking slows down how fast your body absorbs the alcohol, giving your body more time to metabolize it. Fats and complex carbohydrates are especially good.When the meal's over, switch to coffee or sip water and call it a day. Don't continue drinking when you're done. If you're at a busy restaurant, it might be time to give up your table anyway, or you'll start getting dirty looks.  If you've got to meet friends at the bar and are worried you won't be able to control yourself, take steps to actively make it impossible to drink more than you want to allow yourself to drink. Getting in your own way can help you stick to your goals even when your motivation wanes.   Only bring enough cash to pay for two drinks and leave your card at home. Look up the menu ahead of time and find out exactly what you'll be able to afford and only bring enough to pay for that, then call it a night. Drink more expensive alcohol. For one thing, more expensive brands of alcohol have fewer congeners, a chemical that can contribute to hangovers. In addition, you won’t be able to have as many drinks if they’re pricier than what you usually spend.Don’t keep alcohol at home. If you're a regular after-work drinker and want to avoid plowing through a six pack every night, stop buying them and bringing them home with you. If they're sitting there in the fridge, it can be difficult to resist, so don't put them in the fridge. Buy smaller glasses. It can be easy to overindulge if your glasses are too big. For example, a wine glass could actually hold far more than the 5 ounces that counts as “one drink.”You’re more likely to pour too much if your wine glass is wide, or if you hold the glass rather than setting it on a table., If you're going out with friends and have a tendency to want to always order one more, stay another hour, and push your drinking in the wee morning hours, an effective way of cutting back can be to set very rigid times for your drinking. If you're going out around nine to meet friends, don't stay out any later than midnight or one. Make it a particular time that's your "pumpkin hour," or choose a particular number of hours that you can be out.   Setting a limit doesn't mean you should slam as many drinks as possible before your pumpkin-hour rolls around. Remember the end goal, or your goals aren't serving you.  Fun doesn’t always have to involve alcohol. Instead of going out for drinks with your friends, suggest that you do something else. If you're worried you won't be able to resist at the bar, try to arrange to go to a movie, or check out a concert, or doing something else active instead of just hanging around the bar., Practice saying “no” in a polite but firm way.Make eye contact when you refuse the drink. This can help reinforce that you mean what you say.Keep your answer short and simple. Long winded answers or excuses tend to be unconvincing to others. Say something firm and to the point, such as: “No, thanks, I don’t want to” or “No, thanks, today’s my ‘day off’ from alcohol and I’d be really disappointed in myself if I broke that promise.”  

establish drinking ground rules for yourself.  get a sense of what “one drink” looks like.  slow down and make each drink last longer.  stay busy.  make yourself drink four times as much water as alcohol.  only drink with meals.  make it difficult to drink more.  set rigid time-lines for your drinking.  make other plans.  practice saying “no, thanks.” you will probably find yourself in situations where you’re offered a drink you don’t want, or encouraged to drink on a day you’ve set aside as a “day off” from alcohol. 

 The perfect victim for predatory people is timid, weak, unobservant, willing to compromise him or herself to "do the right thing". It is even easier to take advantage of such a person if they are alone, in an isolated place, or intoxicated.  Act confident. Make appropriate eye contact with people in your surroundings. Walk with purpose. Be polite and helpful, but do not compromise yourself. Sometimes predators will try to lure people by appealing to them for help. For instance, if someone in a car asks for directions, by all means help them - from a safe distance. Do not come to the car window. Be with friends or a crowd. It is harder to commit a crime if people have someone with them. Victims are easier to victimize if they are alone. Even having other people nearby make it less likely a crime will occur.; , You do not need to be obsessively vigilant on every little detail or go into paranoid fantasies. However, being aware will keep you from accidents and show potential criminals that you are paying attention.   Avoid constantly texting, talking on your phone, or otherwise allow devices to make you oblivious to your surrounding. Do not have your earbuds on blasting music. Pay attention to the people who are around you. If a drunk yelling obscenities down the street, you can notice him and avoid trouble.  While this may seem counterproductive -- after all aren't you supposed to not draw attention to yourself? -- it actually helps you out in a couple different ways.Be visible. Brightly colored, reflective clothing and lights (such as a headlamp or bicycle lights) helps lessen the danger from car accidents. Wearing dark clothes at night can make you practically invisible. And traffic accidents are far more likely to happen than any crime. It also can make you less of a target. Bright colors have a correlation with confidence and it can make someone who was going to mess with you, less likely to do so, because you're so visible.  While unfortunate things can happen even in well-lit areas, someone can attack you much more easily in a darkened area and it will be much harder to get help should you need it.Stick to well-lit, public thoroughfares, roads, and paths for walking. The more people around, the better.  If something happens to you, you definitely want to have at least one person who knows what you were doing and where you were going.   If you have to walk somewhere at night, make sure that a friend or trusted person knows the route that you took. This way if something does happen to you they know where to start looking.  In this day and age your phone contains so much information that it's tempting not to memorize any of those numbers. You need to make a contingency plan in case you lose your cell phone, it gets stolen, or it runs out of batteries.   Along with the obvious emergency numbers (like the police or fire department) you should have a friend or two that you can call if you run into difficulty. If you can, try to have these numbers be people who live in your area. While it can be tempting to call mom, she might live thousands of miles away and not be able to help you out at all.  if you're going out at night, especially if you're going out clubbing or drinking, try to go with your friends. Make a plan before going out at night designating who is buddied up with whom. This way you'll only have to keep track of one other person and you'll know that someone is looking out for you, too.   If there is a designated driver, have them be in charge of making sure that all the friends are okay. You should also make sure that they get everyone's keys, so no one else tries to leave without them.  If you have to go to the bathroom, go outside for a smoke, or something, and you haven't finished your drink, leave it with a trusted friend. You can't tell if someone has tampered with your drink (like if it has been roofied).   Just remember that even if someone does tamper your drink, it isn't your fault. It's the fault of the person who tampered the drink.  Whether it's cab fare to get you back home, or it's money for the bus or subway, make sure that you always have the right amount to get you back from wherever you are.   Keep your backup money separate from the money you’re spending at night. This way you won't decide to spend your money on the night out, rather than on getting home. This is important even if you're just coming back from work at night. If something makes you uncomfortable or nervous you want to have enough money to get yourself out of the situation by taking a cab or bus, if you need to.  If you're out late and you need to catch a bus, or subway make sure that you know when the last one leaves. This way if you do miss it you don't have to wait around at the bus stop or tube station.   try to have a backup plan for if you do get stranded. Keep the number of a local cab company with you, or have a friend that you can call if you need to. If you do take a bus late at night, sit near the driver. It's much more likely that you'll be robbed or harassed if you sit in the back of the bus than if you sit near the driver.  

do not act like a victim.  be aware of your surroundings.  wear brightly colored or reflective clothing.  avoid walking in unlit areas, such as alleys or parks.  make sure someone knows where you are and what you are doing.  have emergency phone numbers memorized.  follow the buddy system.  if you’re drinking, keep track of your drink.  try to always have money for transportation.  know when the last bus leaves. 

 The payment gateway processes the customer's credit card information by sending the data to the gateway's web server, which then makes the sale and sends the confirmation back to the website. You can quickly integrate your gateway into your website's shopping cart software.; , Your web host or online shop software provider may provide payment gateway services that you can quickly implement on your suite. Check your website's control panel or your online shop's admin page to see if there are payment gateway options.  There are a lot of different payment gateways out there, and they can get a bit confusing. Before you start looking, check which gateways your shopping cart software supports. Your shopping cart software's support site should have a list of compatible payment gateways. Some of the more widely supported gateways include:   PayPal Payza Perfect Money Egopay SecurePay Authorize.net Verify Braintree SecurePay  , The payment gateway will typically charge you a one-time setup fee, a monthly fee, and then charge a small fee for each transaction processed. Compare rates to find the service that meets your needs the best.  External gateways (also known as "redirect") send your customers to another website to process the payment. Direct gateways (also known as "transparent") do the processing within your store, keeping the customer on your site. If possible, choose a direct gateway, as they look more professional.  You will need to sign up for a merchant account, which you then link to your payment gateway. This will allow you to receive payments from the customer. Merchant accounts will typically charge you per transaction as well.  Once you sign up for your gateway, you will be provided the necessary information that you will need to provide to your online store software.   This could be a login name and password, or it could be an ID and an authorization file.  Most online retailers will use third-party software to create a web shop for their customers. This software handles the creation of the ordering page as well as all the code for transferring payment information to the gateway. Creating this code from scratch is one of the most difficult tasks when it comes to web development, so it's usually best left to professionals.  The process for this will vary from service to service, but generally you will need to enter your payment gateway information for each method of payment you intend to accept (Visa, Mastercard, etc.). Your payment gateway determines which cards are accepted.You can do this from your online store's administration page. Find the Payments page, or something similar.  you will typically be provided Test or Sandbox accounts by your payment gateway service. These allow you to perform fake transactions to ensure that the payment process is working correctly. Be sure to test before making your store live.   This will vary again from service to service. Check your payment gateway's support site for details on testing your gateway's integration.  

understand what the gateway does.  check with your web host.  browse your options.  pay attention to fees and conditions.  pick between an external or a direct gateway.  sign up for a merchant account.  sign up for your chosen payment gateway.  set up your web shop.  add payment methods.  test the gateway. 

 After creating your Warlock, you will be taken back to the Character Selection screen where you can select the Warlock you just created from the list of your characters and click on “Enter World” to enter the WoW world. Once you access the world for the very first time at level 1, you will start out in a beginner zone.  The specific zone you are in depends on the race you have chosen; however, all starting zones are designed to help new players become familiar with the game.  Once you log in, you will see large golden text on your screen to the effect of “Click on the character with an exclamation point over his head to take a quest.” So approach and talk to any character with an exclamation point over his or her head to begin a quest.  Similar text will appear on your screen throughout the starting zone, guiding you to gain your first levels. The starting zones are basically a tutorial, the game will keep showing large golden text on your screen instructing you how to begin playing.  You will earn experience for each quest you complete, and once you reach a certain amount of experience, you will gain a level.  The amount of experience needed to gain a level increases with each level. You will gain the first several levels within an hour, while at higher levels, it could take you an hour or more to gain one level.  As you complete quests in the starting zone, you will be offered new quests.  Once you have completed most of the quests, you will be offered quests that take you into another zone. Quests in World of Warcraft are designed to be a continuous process. Completing all the quests in one zone will give you a quest to go into another zone, up until you have reached the highest level.  

enter the world.  start your first quest.  complete the quests and gain levels.  keep questing. 

 After unpacking and unrolling your uniform, check it carefully for any badges. These should be removed before washing.Also, check pant pockets for any items.  To protect the velcro and the color, army combat uniforms should be turned inside prior to washing. Do this each time you wash your uniform., Cold water will prevent damage and discoloration, so always select the coldest water settings possible. If there is a sports wash or permanent press option on your washing machine, use that as well., Avoid wringing or twisting uniforms to dry them. For best results, hang dry uniforms on a clothesline or hanger.If you're in a hurry, you can dry uniforms in a dryer. However, only dry on low to medium heat settings.  Bleach, fabric softener, chlorine, and starch can all harm army combat uniforms. Keep these materials away from army combat uniforms and never use detergents containing these materials when washing uniforms. 

remove any badges before washing.  turn uniforms inside out when washing them.  wash your uniforms only in cold water.  hang dry uniforms.  keep hazardous materials away from uniforms. 

 Typical non-vegan cake baking ingredients include eggs, butter, milk and even refined white sugar, which is manufactured with animal bones.; ,   Most non-vegan cake ingredients such as eggs and butter can be easily replaced with typical household grocery items. For example, bananas and applesauce replace eggs and margarine replaces butter.    One egg can be replaced with 2 tbsp. ground flax seed stirred into 3 tbsp. of water. Replace a single egg by mashing half of a banana or using 3 tbsp. applesauce. 1 egg may also be replaced with 1/4 cup (59.14 ml) of soft tofu that's been run through a blender. Buy a vegan egg replacement product. This non-dairy powdered mix is usually found in health food stores.  Soy and almond milk are the most recommended replacements when baking. You can also use hemp, coconut, or hazelnut milk.   Use the same measurements when substituting dairy milk with vegan replacements.  Be sure that the margarine you use is not made with animal-based ingredients. Health food stores usually carry 100 percent vegan margarine.   Another option for replacing butter with a vegan ingredient is vegetable shortening or applesauce, which can replace up to 3/4 of the total butter used in any baking recipe.  These include granulated cane sugar and date sugar as well as new plant-based sweeteners. Granulated cane sugar may be used in the same proportion as refined sugar. If using date sugar or a plant-based sweetener, use less amounts in the recipe than refined sugar. These products are far sweeter than typical refined sugar.   Liquid sweeteners such as barley malt and maple syrup can also be used but be sure to slightly reduce the use of other liquids in your cake recipe.  Vegans prefer to use non-refined flours made with barley, brown rice, potato and Kamut, which are found in health food stores.   Alternatively, you can ground 1 cup (236.5 ml) of whole rolled oats to create 3/4 cup (177.4 ml) of oat flour.  For a vegan cake frosting, replace the use of butter with blended tofu and cooking oil or margarine.  

review the recipe to determine the non-vegan ingredients.  search your pantry for items that make good substitutes for the non-vegan cake ingredients.  omit the use of eggs from the recipe and replace with a comparable ingredient.  replace any milk used in the cake recipe with non-dairy alternatives.  substitute butter with equal amounts of a vegan butter alternative, such as margarine.  choose a vegan sugar substitute, which is generally healthier than refined brown and white sugars.  replace refined white flour with healthier alternatives.  make the frosting. 

 The term “bootcut” isn't just for show. These jeans are fitted around the hips but flare out slightly below the knee, making them the ideal cut to wear over ankle boots and other boot styles.   Be careful when pairing ankle boots with jean styles that are cut wide down the length of the leg or those that flare out dramatically from the knee down. If you have shorter legs, these styles can make your legs appear even shorter when paired with ankle boots.; , Instead of trying to tuck or hem these jeans, allow them to fall directly over the top of each boot, masking the boot from sight.   Avoid tucking and cuffing bootcut jeans. The extra material used to create the wide, open legs can look bumpy and unflattering when manipulated.  Bend your knees while wearing both the jeans and the boots. If the jeans are long enough, they should continue to hide the top edge of the boots even when the material bunches in this manner.When worn poorly, ankle boots can break the visual leg line at an awkward place and cause your legs to look shorter as a result. By wearing bootcut jeans that sufficiently and smoothly cover the tops of these boots, you can prevent that broken, stubby look and help your legs appear longer.  

opt for bootcut jeans.  wear the jeans over the boots.  check the length. 

 The tractor needs regular maintenance to keep it working properly, and the planters, although simpler, also have moving parts that need attention periodically.; , For large garden projects, buying from a seed store, or even a catalog seed company which sells seeds in bulk (by the ounce, pound, or even bushel) is far cheaper than buying prepackaged seed at a big box store.  You should determine the amount of seed you need by the linear feet of rows you intend to plant, and the proprietor of the seed store can help with this.  The soil may need to be subsoiled or bottom-plowed, but in most cases, simply harrowing with a disc-harrow will loosen the soil and turn any plant material into it, leaving a smooth, clean soil bed for cultivating.  Different crops have different sized seed, and these seeds are planted at different spacing, so the proper plates are needed to insure successful planting. The crop being planted in the illustrations is English (Sweet) Peas, and they are spaced 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) apart. This means the planter plates (the device that lifts the seeds from the seed box to the planting chute) will have a large number of notches. These notches fill with the seed, then, as the drive chain turns the plates, they are deposited in the feed tube, which drops them into the furrow.  On two row planters, you should divide the seeds equally between the two seed boxes so each will continue planting until the seed runs out.  Simply raise the planter assembly with the three point hitch so the packing wheels clear the ground, and rotate these by hand. When the packing wheels turn, the drive chain will rotate the seed plates, and you can count how many seeds are dropped during each revolution, then divide this number by the circumference of the packing wheel. This will give you your seed spacing.  For the first pair of rows, you may want to establish a marker so the rows are laid out straight, but you may be able to use the edge of your garden patch or field to accomplish this.  As you begin to move, the packing wheels will turn the seed plates, and planting has begun.  Three point hitch assemblies have an adjustable link to raise or lower one side of the lift, so that even on ground that isn't level, the implement can be operated parallel to the ground.  This will insure the mechanism does not lurch or bind up, and the seeds do not bounce out of the notches in the plates.  After turning the tractor around, realign your front wheel in the center of the rear wheel track you made while planting the first two rows. If your tractor wheel width is correctly set for your row width, this will maintain the correct space between the alternating rows as you plant two more alongside them. Normal row spacing is 36 inches (91.4 cm) center to center, and so, tractor wheel centers should be set 72 inches (182.9 cm) apart. , Now may be a good time start thinking about fertilization, weed control, and pest control, while you await the first green sprouts to emerge.  

keep your equipment in good working order.  purchase your seeds.  chose a specific plant variety that is acclimated to your growing region and conditions, and suits your taste.  prepare the soil for planting.  select the plates you will need to plant with.  place your seeds in the seed boxes (the hoppers that hold them until the plates dispense them into the furrows).  test the seed placement spacing after you install the correct plates.  align your tractor on the rows you are going to plant.  drop the planters to the correct depth for the row openers and de-clutch your tractor.  stop after the first few feet to make sure each of the row openers are at the same depth, and that they are covering the seeds correctly.  run your tractor at a modest uniform speed.  lift the planters up with the three point lift before turning around at the end of the row.  continue planting until you are finished, checking occasionally to ensure the row openers are clear, there are seeds left in the seed box, and the chains and plates are operating freely and smoothly.  ,  clean the seed boxes out and lubricate the drive chains when the planting operation is complete. 

 See what it does. Playfully hit it. See what it does again. Watch for other behaviors too. Relate these actions to things that might happen to you. (e.g. Someone is bothering you, and you hiss or some one is mad at you, walk away or hiss, etc.); , Tigers favor water more than any other big cat. If you seriously flat out can't swim, it's no big deal. But it's best if you want to really prove you have tiger in you. When swimming, you might want to throw some object in the pool and jump on top of it (which relates to hunting fish).  If someone you dislike comes in your territory, roar or growl at them. If someone you don't know comes in, curiously inspect them. If they seem nice, let them in. If you sense danger,chase them out.  Tigers are strong animals, so you need to keep in shape. Get strong, and exercise a lot so that you will have endurance, speed, and strength.  This is entirely optional. You can wear tiger striped shirts if you want, but you really don't have to. If you know what a furry is, and you want to wear a furry costume, then go ahead, because that's a great choice. There are many furries around. Most people who want to release an inner animal actually are furries! If you can't acquire a costume or tiger-related clothing, just wear some orange-white clothes.  Your friends might think you're crazy, but that's okay. If your clan members or friends think something is wrong with you, then just explain to them what you are doing. If they are a good friend, they will understand. Also,if someone else is being dominant and being leader,roar at them to tell them they are acting like a wolf,not tiger.  

observe your cat.hiss at it.  swim...a lot.  protect your territory.  stay fit.  wear tiger related clothing.  follow through with your plans. 

 Also ensure that ID information is up-to-date with your latest cellphone number, address and email address. If your pet does go missing, this makes it easier to return the pet.; , Sorry, treats are not allowed.Treats are for boys and girls, not cats and dogs. Chocolate, especially, is a candy that can poison your pet, and many other treats are too high in sugar or could pose a choking hazard, such as marshmallows. Xylitol and gum, ingredients of some candies, are dangerous for pets.It is best to avoid giving any Halloween treats to pets. After all, they don't know it's a special occasion and are simply happily living the day as any other, by being around you.   Be sure to keep all treats out of reach from pets. Put them up high, behind cupboard doors, etc. Explain to children how important it is that Fido or Kitty cannot come across their treats stash and start nibbling. Ask children not to give treats to pets and to put their treats where pets cannot find them.  Pumpkin and corn decorations are nontoxic, but if eaten, may give your pet a mild stomachache.   Read How to stop your dog from eating your plants for some tips on plant safety with canine pets.  Many pets find the whole costume dressing upsetting and strange. It's an anthropomorphic desire to put pets in costumes and doesn't make the pet happy. Unless you've trained the animal from an early age to wear clothing, it's best not done. Try it on the day before, to see what reaction you get––if the pet behaves in an annoyed or frustrated way, the costume is not suitable.   If using a costume, ensure that it cannot harm the animal in any way. Dangling pieces can cause a pet to trip, hang or choke; fabrics can be too hot, constricting or itchy; costumes can cause injuries you haven't foreseen just by dint of restricting the animal's movements.  If your pets usually roam around the front yard or entrance areas, keep them in the backyard or inside the house for the evening. That way, you will avoid scaring the pets or having excited or scared pets rushing at trick-and-treaters and frightening the children. This also prevents any potential for bites from your pets.   In this case, ensure that your pet cannot get to the front door when the trick-and-treaters call. A quiet room somewhere at the back of your house is a good choice for the night.If your backyard is not secure, do not leave your pet there. Some pranksters take pets on Halloween night if access is easy. It is also a good idea to keep cats indoors before, during and after Halloween, especially black cats, to prevent pranksters from taking them., If you've chosen to keep your people-loving pet at the front door, do not stop paying attention to it. If the pet seems unhappy, scared or bothered, remove it to somewhere safe. Realize that this is risky, owing to the fact that people will look unusual in their costumes, and many trick-and-treaters are liable to be loud, shouting and overly excited. This could send a pet into a frenzy of worry or excitement.   Leash the dog near the door, so that it cannot get past you in the doorway.  Most treats are unhealthy for pets, as discussed above.  Wires and cords must be a far distance from pets. They should also be taped down or put out of reach to prevent tripping from trick-or-treaters so this safety precaution serves both people and pets.  For example, while carved pumpkins are festive, if you choose to add a candle be careful that pets cannot knock it over and hurt themselves or start a fire.   Scented candles are toxic for indoor birds.Rubber items can present choking hazards, fake cobwebs/strung lights can entangle animals and wildlife and glowsticks and fake blood can be poisonous to pets that try to lick or chew these substances., If your dog hates crowds, people it doesn't know or flashing lights, loud noises and general hubbub, do not take your dog trick-or-treating. Anything could cause such a dog to react in fear and either take flight and run away or possibly bite someone.   Taking your dog should only be done, if at all, in quiet, small neighborhood trick-and-treating exercises. In busy, noisy and crowded streets, this is not acceptable.  Do not take your dog trick-or-tricking without this. You must be able to restrain your dog quickly and effectively.  If you're going onto people's properties, consider having someone hold the dog at the gate for you, or ask the owners ahead if it's okay to bring your dog into the yard. Since this is an onerous thing to do, it may be easiest leaving Fido at home.   You could tag team with a friend; one holds the dog, the other collects the treats. Or, ask an older sibling or a parent to come along and hold the dog for you.  The dog's senses will soon get overloaded and will need a break from all the excitement.  

check that your pet's ids are on the pet (and that microchips are in place).  do not feed halloween treats to any pets.  make sure that any halloween plants, fruits or vegetables you've chosen to put on display are not toxic.  avoid using costumes on pets unless your pet is accustomed to being dressed.  consider placing your pet's out of the way for the evening.  keep an eye on your pet.  do not allow trick-and-treaters to give the pet treats.  keep electrical wires out of the reach of pets.  take care with decorations.  be guided by the temperament of your dog.  ensure that the dog is on a harness or leash.  be aware that many people will not appreciate a dog being brought along.  avoid walking the dog for too long amid crowds and halloween decorations. 

 Harlem Shake videos popped up like flies on the roadkill of the Internet for a hot minute, but it's a little too late to record one now unless all you want is groans. Before that it was "What girls say" videos. You've got to beat them to the punch!   Get in on the ground floor. If someone's forwarded you a funny video, change one of the central components of it and record a new version to look as much like the original as possible. Maybe you've got a meme in the making. What makes the original unique? With Harlem Shake, it was the sudden jump-cut when the beat dropped and the ludicrous dancing. Groups like sports teams and army units made perfect matches with the one-then-a bunch of people transition.; , Iconic scenes from recent movies are fantastic to include in your own parodies. The video of a mumbling Batman interrogating the Joker was all over YouTube for a minute when the movie was so popular and people were complaining about Batman's comical rasp. Capitalize on a new movie's success and make fun of it at the same time.   Give it a twist to make it your own. Maybe you do a shot-for-shot remake of the restaurant scene from the Godfather, even going so far as to memorize the Italian, but you're all wearing turn-of-the-century one-piece bathing suits and stroking handlebar mustaches. Ok, maybe that's a terrible idea, but put some creative spin on a classic and you'll get some views.  In programs like Windows Movie Maker and iMovie, you can easily edit existing film and make it your own. If you've got footage from DVDs you've ripped or downloaded from YouTube previously, you can mess with the sound, add subtitles, and make new scenes.   Add subtitles or voice over to old footage. Adding humorous interior monologue to old Chuck Norris flicks is comedy gold. GOLD. Edit together only the fight scenes from your favorite action movies, or Bond's best one-liners into a great and quick video that'll be funny to watch. Edit together the comic relief footage from a horror movie to make it look like a family rom-com, or take old footage from family flicks and make it look like a creepy slasher flick.  One thing about humans is for sure: they love looking at videos of animals, especially the baby versions of animals. And if you add clips from the Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack, you're on your way to a classic YouTube clip.   Keep toys or treats out of the shot and tease your pet into acting silly. Or record animals interacting, or animals places in awkward circumstances, like on trampolines, in bathtubs, or in boxes. Wait until your pet is asleep and then wake them up with a camera. Squeefest. If your pet has a funny voice or an ugly face, all the better.  If you're planning on filling your friend's shorts with Nutella or loading his shower-head with Jolly Ranchers, you might as well catch it on film. Could be hilarious. Just make sure you get permission before uploading anything that might be embarrassing.  

do a variation on a popular video trend.  reenact scenes from recent or classic movies.  edit other footage.  record your pet and add dramatic music.  record a prank. 

 Avril's skin usually looks flawless, so buy some foundation and apply it evenly on your face.  No matter which look she's rocking, Avril's famous smokey eye is consistent. Start with your eyeliner. Draw a thick line along the upper lashes with black eyeliner, then do the same thing along your lower lash line, taking it all the way into the inner and outer corners of your eye. You can also add a little "wing" or "cattail" at the edge of the eye.  Put a grey colour all over your eyelid, and then apply black eyeshadow along your outer eyelid.   If you want to, add sparkles, like Avril does on stage.  Use about two coats of volumizing mascara (make sure that your lashes don't clump) on both the upper and lower lashes.  Avril Lavigne uses extremely light pink blush. Dust some blush on the apples of your cheeks.  Because Avril always wants the focus to be on her eyes, she tones down her lip color. She usually wears light, natural colors. Do not go with anything that is too red, unless you want to look like her in the video "Hot".  

apply some foundation.  start to create the smokey eye.  apply your eyeshadow.  top off your eyes with mascara.  put on some blush.  use nude lipstick. 

 While you want to rest up the day and night before you start your new job, make fruitful use of the remainder of any lag time you have before starting.Contact HR and complete ahead of time some of the mountain of forms that will surely be waiting for you. This will enable you to focus your first day more on getting to know your workplace and co-workers, and to jump right in to work. Keep up-to-date on the company by following its website, social media presence, and media mentions. Be ready for any changes (good or bad) that may happen between your hiring and first day. Ask your supervisor if there is any research, organization, or other preparatory work you can begin before your first day. This will help you get a “leg up” on your initial tasks and shows initiative.  The first impression you make on your co-workers will be difficult to change, so provide them an image of a friendly, engaging, helpful, and dedicated compatriot.Do a little homework on the web to familiarize yourself with your co-workers ahead of time (basic info, not life histories — you want to be seen as a friend, not a stalker).Then, on your first day, introduce yourself to everyone you can, but in an organic, sensible manner. That is, don’t walk right past people without shaking hands and giving your name, but also don’t glad-hand around the room like you’re running for President while people are busy working.Accept invitations to lunch, drinks after work, or other such get-togethers if at all possible. This is part of why you want to pack a first-day lunch that you don’t have to feel bad about leaving in your desk (or worry about the smell if you do).Volunteer to help with tasks, or even take one on yourself. Earn a reputation right from the start as a helpful, eager “team player.” Don’t let it backfire by taking on tasks for which you are not yet prepared to do well, however.  As indicated in this section, you don’t want to be a wallflower on your first day. At the same time, however, don’t spend so much time trying to force a good first impression that you miss opportunities to gather key intelligence about your new workplace and co-workers.  Watch how decision are made, and get a feeling for where the centers of power reside and how the office politics play out. Much of this may not occur in the same manner as described in your orientation packet. Get an idea about who you need to befriend and who you should be wary of if you want to succeed. Pay attention to the office rules — phone and social media usage, breaks, dress code, etc. — presented during your orientation, but also observe the “rules.” That is, see how things are actually done on the ground. It’s best to err on the side of the official policies, especially early on, but you also want to know how things operate among your co-workers. On a side note regarding your phone: silence it the first day, if possible. Present an image of focus and dedication., Your co-workers and supervisors probably expect some mistakes and failures as you adjust, but that doesn’t mean they want to hear you explain them away by saying “I’m new here” or “It’s my first day.” No one likes excuses, even when they are somewhat understandable, so making a “no excuses” first impression will pay dividends for you.Through preparation and focused effort, do all you can to make your initial tasks be successful tasks. The quality of your initial work can help you earn a reputation as a “go to” person who can be trusted to do exceptional work. Do the job to the best of your abilities, and if you need guidance or help, ask for it. People expect the new guy / gal to need some assistance. It’s better to meet a new co-worker by asking “Can you give me a hand formatting this? I want to make sure I do it right.” than it is to say “Sorry I messed up that formatting. I’m new here, after all.”  

start before you start.  be eager but not overbearing.  listen, observe, and learn.  don’t make excuses. 

 Aria has long, curly dark hair. Grow out your hair, but occasionally you can get it trimmed to avoid split ends. Change your shampoo and conditioner and/or dye it to make it more similar to Aria's.   Aria normally has loosely curled hair, so it would be best to curl your hair with a large barrel curling iron.

Go see some classic plays, as well, such as "Romeo & Juliet," "Waiting for Godot," and "No Exit." Plays, after all, are a form of literature.  Aria keeps a detailed journal of her life.

 Fill a medium stockpot with 2 inches (5 cm) of water. Set the pan on the stove over medium-high heat and bring the water to a steady simmer.   Make sure that the steamer basket fits inside the mouth of the stockpot. The basket should be able to rest over the lip of the pan without touching the bottom of the pot.  Place the baby corn in the steamer basket, then set the steamer basket on top of the stockpot and over the simmering water.   Try to arrange the baby corn cobs into an even layer to promote even cooking.  Cover the steamer and stockpot with an appropriate lid. Steam the baby corn until it becomes slightly tender.Check for doneness by piercing the corn with a fork. It should be easy to pierce, but it should still retain some crispness. Past the “tender crisp” stage, baby corn can become soggy and unpleasant.  Remove the baby corn from the heat and serve it while it's still hot.   Consider serving the baby corn with butter or a drizzle of olive oil. Store leftovers in an airtight container in your refrigerator. Use within one or two days.  

simmer the water.  place the baby corn in the steamer.  cook for 3 to 6 minutes.  serve. 

 It's not something you're entitled to. If someone is hesitant to give you additional responsibility, it's probably because you've been nonchalant with the responsibilities you already have. You might think, "But the responsibilities I have now are so petty/boring/stupid/etc., and if I'm given more of a challenge, I will take it more seriously," but that's a characteristic of irresponsible people; they do things as long as they're challenging, fun, and new, and when that fades, they lose interest. , In any situation, there are always some factors we can't control. Irresponsible people tend to shift the blame onto those factors and vocalize them as excuses. Anytime you make an excuse, it's like saying "I am not responsible for this because..." and what you're really saying is "I am not responsible." Pay attention to how you think and talk: do you find yourself making excuses? Excuses come in many shapes and sizes, but the most common is "I would/would've, but...".   The next time you catch yourself in the middle of an excuse, change your words. Instead, admit why you really didn't get that thing done. Were you too lazy, too tired, or just feeling like doing something more fun? It's okay to admit it. In fact, it's best to admit your real reasons for not doing something before you move on.  Making the most of a mistake is a double-whammy of responsibility. Not only does this transform time that was otherwise wasted into a valuable, course-altering experience, but it keeps you from wasting future time by ensuring that you don’t repeat yourself. One of the key parts of accepting responsibility is being able to say, "I really messed up here. I won't do it again."   The next time you find yourself in a similar situation, remind yourself about what you did wrong the last time, and make sure you don't go down that path again.  Another way to accept responsibility is to stop putting the blame on everyone around you. Keep telling yourself that you failed your math test because you didn't study, not because your teacher hates you; you cheated on your boyfriend because you chose to do so, not because he wasn't giving you enough attention; you were late to work because you didn't get out of the house early enough, not because of the horrible traffic. Sure, life isn't fair, and unfortunately, some people have it rougher than others. You can blame your parents for not loving you enough and leading you down a dark path to an extent, but you won't be able to change the course of your life until you own up to your actions and try to change them.  Complaining is another useless habit of the irresponsible person. If you do nothing but complain about your boss, about the weather, or about the ridiculously high prices of lattes at Starbucks, you won't get yourself very far. Complaining is another way of blaming the world for your problems instead of taking initiative and knowing what you can change. You may not be able to change the price of lattes at Starbucks, but you can get your own coffee machine and make your morning brew on the cheap.   Every time you open your mouth to complain, stop yourself and say something positive instead. You'll be amazed by how much this changes your perspective.  The world is not out to get you. If you want to start being responsible, then stop thinking that everyone is out to make you fail or look bad. The police officer didn't give you that speeding ticket because he or she was determined to punish you; he or she did it because you were breaking the law. Your boss didn't decline to give you a raise because he or she wanted to see you fail; he or she did it because your performance didn't merit one, or because the company simply couldn't pay up.  Think it's important to accept responsibility for your actions, it's equally important to understand that there are some things in life that are simply out of your control. You can't be responsible for your best friend's drinking problem; you can't be responsible for the failure of your entire company unless it's single-handedly your fault; you can't be responsible for your irresponsible roommate's failure to pay the rent in a timely fashion. Focus on the things that you can control, and don't try to fix all of the problems in the world, or you'll just be headed for a headache.  If you want to be responsible, then you need to practice self-discipline. This doesn't mean you have to have the work ethic of a rocket scientist or the routine of a military cadet, but it does mean that you have to be able to know how and when work is done, and not to blow off any important tasks in favor of having fun. To be self-disciplined, you have to set goals and meet them without getting distracted. Make a manageable to-do list every day and try to complete as many tasks as you can.   Reward yourself for completing difficult tasks by going out and doing something fun. Don't stop having fun just to be disciplined.; , Be sure to study for your biology test is no fun, but think of how great you'll feel when you get an 'A' in the class -- and how much that will help you meet your ultimate goal of becoming a doctor.  If you want to be truly responsible, then you need to know how to deal with all of life's challenges, not just with passing your next math test. This means knowing how to behave when tragedy or hardship strikes. You'll have to be responsible in the face of devastating news, keep your cool, and be a support system for the other people who need you. And even if the situation isn't devastating, but truly stressful, like the failure of a major project at work, you have to learn how to keep it together during a tough situation.   Learning to deal with the hard stuff takes practice. You won't be able to deal with a tough situation on the first go around. But as you develop as a person, you'll learn how to stay calm and think rationally in the middle of a crisis.  Multitasking is another crucial skill of a responsible person. If you want to be truly responsible, then you have to be able to juggle all of the things on your plate. Being responsible means caring for your child, succeeding at work, and remembering to pay your bills on time all in the same day. Though you can't get everything done at once, you can't completely neglect one task in favor of another.   When it comes to multitasking, it's important to get your priorities straight. Remind yourself that it's more important to pay your bills than to make a hair appointment, in most cases.  Think you shouldn't commit to something or someone just for the sake of it, you shouldn't be so commitment phobic that you can't even go to a yoga class more than once a month before you feel like it's "too much" for you. Committing to something, whether it's your work on the school newspaper or to your new healthy relationship, will help you learn to care for something outside yourself, and to develop healthy habits and routines around that thing.   Studies shows, for example, that high school athletes actually do better in school. The commitment to sports helps them develop a responsible daily routine that helps them get things done.  Money management is another important quality of a responsible person. If you find yourself living paycheck to paycheck or wondering where your money goes each month, then you need to sit down with your bills and to make a list of all of the things you really don't need to spend money on. Being responsible with your finances helps you plan ahead, learn moderation, and keeps you from being impulsive.   Plan a monthly fun budget. Let's say you can afford to spend $350 on fun stuff each month. Keep that in mind every time you go out to eat, buy concert tickets, or have a random night out with friends. If you run out by the end of the month, you may have to plan alternate nights in for a while. Ask yourself about what you really need to vs. what you really want to ask yourself is, do you need a new dress for a special occasion, or to change the oil in your car instead?  , Your responsibility won't mean much if it's hit or miss. If you want to be responsible, then you have to find a routine that works for you and stick to it. Don't just study for ten hours in a row and then give up on studying for three weeks; instead, spend one hour every day or two looking over the course material. Don't call your friend back right away for a few days when she needs you and then fall off the grid for a few weeks; instead, call her back within a day or two, if it's really important.   Being consistent will help you establish a routine that will help you get things done.  If people never ask you for rides or for help after school or work because they just know you'll flake on them, say you'll help and then forget about it completely, or that you're just not the kind of person they can trust with even the most simple tasks, then you may have a problem. Work on sticking to your word and being a person that others can actually depend on.   If you want people to really take you seriously and see you as a responsible person, then you have to give rides when you say you will, show up when you say you'll be there, and make people think of you as a person who has his or her act together.  It's part of being a responsible person, It's also being open to criticism and acknowledging when someone has given you valid feedback that can help you improve as a person. If you want to be responsible in school, listen to your teachers when they tell you where you can improve. If you want to be responsible at work, then listen to your superiors when they mention areas that you need to work on. If your friends mention a flaw you can address in a reasonable manner, then don't just brush them off because you think you've got it all covered.   Feedback can help you to be more responsible person and to manage your stuff better.  As with most other tasks, acting responsible works the best when you can get a bit of momentum going. If you feel crushed under a backlog of responsibilities, start with a few small or fast tasks. Being able to cross them off your list will make you feel as though a weight has been lifted, making you more enthusiastic about moving on to bigger responsibilities. Before you know it, being responsible will make you feel good and add value to your day.  Start with Goldie and work your way up.  Helping other people achieve their goals, or even just helping others by making them feel better, is a great way to develop a habit of a responsible person. Once you've got yourself covered, you should make a goal of helping out your grandparents, your other elders, your friends, or even people in your community that need your help. Making this a weekly thing can help you become dependable and to develop a schedule that you have to stick to. Looking out for other people will help you become more responsible.   Just remember that you should only go out and help others after you feel that you have covered all of your own responsibilities. Don't rush out and start working at a soup kitchen if you can barely get your homework or chores done.  This is the ultimate characteristic of the irresponsible person, and you want to avoid it like the plague. If you have a big exam coming up this week, then spend all week preparing for it; or even start reviewing a few weeks in advance. Don't stay up late the night before, overdosing on Red Bull until you start seeing spirits dancing before your eyes. Make a game plan for tackling your goal early, and chip away at it a little bit at a time.   This goes for the small stuff, to big. Even if you don't want to mow the lawn or call your friend back, a responsible person does what he said he'd do because he said he would. Period. If you want to be seen as more responsible, think about the responsibilities you already have and take them more seriously, no matter how pointless they might seem. Consider it a way to pay your dues.  When you see something that needs to be done or needs to change, don't wait for somebody else to do it; be the one to make a positive difference. Taking charge will make you feel powerful, which will spill into and improve many other aspects of your life. Of course, don't jump into something that makes you go in way over your head, but take charge when you know you can handle it, not just when no one else will. This "go better" habit will get you ahead in work and school.   If your roommate didn't do any of the housework, don't wait around for them to do it. Do it yourself and have a conversation about it later.  Set a few goals that you want to achieve. They could be long term, like becoming a doctor, more abstract, like becoming a better friend, or more short-term, like making your bed every day or running a 5K within a month. Whatever they are, write them down, and come up with a plan for how exactly you will tackle them. This is a great habit and it will help you keep your eyes on the prize and to see what it is you have to do. If you don't have any goals, you won't have nearly as much motivation to lift a finger.   Put these goals on an index card you keep in your wallet, or hang them above your desk; let them inspire you, not pressure you. Set realistic goals, of course, don't say you want to be President of the United States in the next four years.  The responsible person has a daily routine that works for them. Wake up around the same time every day and go to bed around the same time every night. Try to eat around the same hours. Work out in regular intervals, instead of running for a few fitful days and then couch surfing for weeks. Pick the best time to get certain work done, to answer emails, to read, and to do housework. If you try to do it all haphazardly, it will feel a lot more overwhelming and will take longer.   Having a daily routine will help you manage your work and play better and will make you more on top of your game. You don't have to stick to the routine in an obsessive fashion if you have something else coming up, but keep things as regular as you can.  This is another move of the responsible person. Make sure you lock your car, keep it filled with gas, and remember where you parked it. Label all of your notebooks and keep them safe in your locker. Keep your keys on a thick keychain on your person. Keep a case for your sunglasses and tell yourself that if you lose them, you won't replace them for six months so you learn your lesson.You can't be a responsible person if you have to replace your laptop, phone, and other possessions every six months.   Keep your computer away from hot drinks, and don't play on your laptop outside an "up and coming" café; stay inside where you are protected. Get the "Find my iPhone" app and make sure you can lock or wipe your Apple devices if someone steals them.  Around 5 minutes early works best.   Letting people see you get too intoxicated will also make them see you as unreliable and will make them less likely to respect you or think you can handle responsibility. A classic responsible person is on top of his correspondences. This makes you look like you're not juggling 80 million different tasks at all times and don't have your act together.  

understand that responsibility is earned.  whether you're at work, school, or an extra-curricular, you have to prove that you can handle the smaller stuff before you're given more responsibility.  ,  stop making excuses.  admit your mistakes.  stop blaming other people for your problems.  stop complaining.  stop playing the victim.  accept what you cannot control.  practice self-discipline.  remind yourself of the end game to stay motivated.  learn to deal with the hard stuff.  multitask like a champion.  learn to commit.  learn to manage your money.  be consistent.  being reliable, it's part of being responsible person that other people can depend on.  take serious feedback.  start small.  make a list of all of the ways in which you want to be more responsible, of being a better friend, taking better care of your car, being a better student, watching over your goldfish more carefully.  help others.  avoid procrastinating.  take initiative.  become a goal-setter.  develop a daily routine.  be responsible for your possession.  aim going to show up early everywhere. 

 To start, position the injured person on his back. This helps get the injured person in the correct position to be carried. You should carry someone from the side if he's unresponsive or unable to move. It's usually safer to carry someone in a sitting position, but this is not always possible if the person is unable to change positions. It's safer, in this case, to carry the injured person from the side.Go slowly to avoid further injury. If the injured person is able to talk, check in frequently to make sure he is comfortable throughout the process. In the event the injured person is unconscious, you may want to tie his hands loosely together at the wrists. This can make the carrying process easier. If you have something that can be used to tie the injured person's hands, like thick rope or a bandana, you can use this.Do not use anything thin or sharp to tie the person's hands — this can cut the person's wrists.; , From here, you and your partner should each stand on the side of the injured person. One person should stand near the injured person's shoulders and the other should stand near the injured person's knees. Both of you should bend down on one knee so you're level with the injured person., From here, you and your partner can take hold of the injured person. Depending on where you're standing, you'll need to take hold of different parts of the injured person.   The person standing near the injured person's chest should slip one arm beneath the injured person's shoulder and the other arm beneath the injured person's waist.The person standing near the injured person's knees should place one arm beneath the injured person's hips and the other arm beneath the injured person's knees., From here, you can shift the weight of the injured person into you and your partner's arms. In unison, you and your partner should shift your weight backwards. Lift the injured person up together, until the injured person is level with you and your partner's knees. Still working in unison, both you and your partner should turn the injured person in towards your chests., From here, you and your partner can rise to your feet. Make sure you and your partner are communicating so you lift at the same time, as not to jostle or otherwise disturb the injured person. As you stand, make sure to carry the injured person high up, towards both of your chests.Lift with your legs, not your back. If you're truly the only people who can help the person, you mustn't hurt yourselves in the process. In the the event the injured person is very heavy, you may need to have another person assist in supporting the injured person's weight.  

position the injured person on his back.  stand on the injured person's side.  take hold of the injured person.  shift the weight of the injured person.  stand in unison. 

 The 55-card edition is designed for up to 4 players and the 84-card edition is designed for up to 6 players. Keep in mind that because the deck will be divided among all the players after the starting word is made, more players means fewer cards in each person's hand., The starting word must have four letters and should be a word that can be made into another 4-letter word by changing one of its letters.Good starting words include "GAME," which can be turned into "FAME," "LAME," "GATE," or "GAZE," and "WARE," which can be changed into "WERE," "WARM," "WARN," or "WART." Bad starting words include "ECHO" and "EXAM," which cannot readily be turned well-known 4-letter words.  Place these cards on your table or playing surface where everyone can see them and reach them. Make sure that they are forming the starting word you have chosen. Leave a bit of space between the cards so that the cards you put on top of these cards will not overlap., You may want to shuffle the cards first to make sure that everyone gets a good mixture of letters. Make sure that everyone has the same number of cards when you are done dealing the cards. Remember, all of the cards should be dealt to players; there should be no cards left in the deck., Remind your fellow players that the cards are two-sided. They are printed with a letter on each side, or with a letter on one side and a blank space on the other. Either side of the card may be played to make a legal word, with the blank serving as a "wild letter" as in the Scrabble board game.Get into the habit of looking at the upper left edge of your cards, rather than flipping them back and forth. At the upper left edge you can see the two letters that the card represents.  The official call to begin play is "Ready, set, slam"; however, you can call "Go," "Start," or something similar, if you wish. Just make it clear to your fellow players that the game is starting. Scrabble Slam! is a fast-paced game, so everyone needs to be ready to play when it is time to start., Scrabble Slam! is a speed game; players do not take turns placing new letters on the word. If you are playing with young children, then you may want to consider making teams to give them more chances to play.Words in Scrabble Slam! are restricted the same as in the Scrabble crossword game: you can't use slang, acronyms, proper names for people or places, hyphenated words, or words with apostrophes. You cannot play the same letter if it will make the same word. For example, if the current word is "BALE," you cannot play another "B" immediately on top of the "B" in the word. You can, however, play a "G" to change the word to "GALE" and then play a "B" to change the word back to "BALE" if you can do so before another player changes the word to something else.  to challenge a word. If you don’t think that something one of your fellow players has played is a real word, then you can call for a time out. Then, stop playing to discuss the word's legitimacy and consult a dictionary if necessary. If the word is not a legal Scrabble Slam! word, the player making the word must take back the letter card used to make it., The game is over when one player has no more cards or no more legal plays can be made. At this point, you can declare a winner. If someone gets rid of all of his or her cards first, that player is the winner. If all of the players still have cards and no one can make a play, then whoever has the fewest cards left is the winner. 

decide how many players there will be.  choose the starting word.  draw and place the four cards you need to make the starting word.  deal the remaining cards among all of the players.  make sure everyone understands how the cards work.  begin playing the game.  place a letter on the word to make a new word as soon as you recognize you have a play.  call "time out!",  continue playing until someone wins the game. 

 Wipe up the excess dust with a shop vacuum and tack cloths. Both surfaces must be completely dust free.   It is a good idea to vacuum in the workspace to avoid adhesion problems and blowing dust.; , Use a solvent to remove oil and dirt if the item can’t be washed with mild detergent and water. Dry the surfaces completely.  Read the package to determine more specific temperature requirements for the adhesive you are using.  Hand held spray applicators are ideal for small jobs. High volume, low-pressure applicators are ideal for medium to large jobs jobs.   Automatic spray applicators are ideal for the largest jobs. They will require larger air compressors. Pressurized cylinders and compressors require care during storage and use.  Adhesives can contain strong chemicals.  Turn on the adhesive and apply it one coat at a time, until you are comfortable and ready to work on your main project., Both surfaces need to be facing up to apply the adhesive.  Spray a uniform layer and then let it dry for 30 minutes. These surfaces require two coats of adhesive to adhere completely.  Allow it to dry for 10 to 30 minutes, or the amount indicated on package directions. It must dry slightly to evaporate some of the liquid before it is ready to adhere.   Some adhesives require you to wait four to 24 hours before bonding. Bonding is the act of connecting the two adhesive surfaces together and smoothing the air bubbles out., Use several parallel spacers. Place your other surface on top of these spacers and position it exactly.  Set the top surface carefully on the bottom surface.  Start in the center and work out toward the edges.  Try a pinch or nip roll for best results., If you’ve done a thorough job of applying pressure, you can trim the edges almost immediately with power tools or machinery.  

sand both surfaces if you are using wood, plywood or other rough surfaces.  clean the surfaces.  ensure the ambient temperature of the items and the workspace is at least 65 degrees fahrenheit (18 degrees celsius).  ask for directions using the spray container if it is rented.  wear a mask, gloves and ventilation mask when working with adhesives.  practice spraying the contact adhesive on a practice item.  prop up your surfaces onto worktables or sawhorses.  apply a coat of adhesive to glossy surfaces.  apply a uniform and generous coat of adhesive to other surfaces or a second coat to the glossy surface.  place spacers or dowels on top of surfaces that require exact positioning.  ask an assistant to hold the top item in place while you remove the spacers.  apply uniform pressure on the two surfaces to adhere them.  use a three-inch (7.5cm) roller to rid the surface of air bubbles, working from center to edge in all directions.  trim the sides after the surfaces have been rolled and the bond has been set. 

 In addition to the basic supplies you should already have for your birds, you will need a large cage for the canaries to breed in, a nest for the female to lay its eggs in, and nesting material the female will use to build up the nest.You may also need a light to shine on the cage if your region is getting less than 14 hours of light each day.   There are special breeding cages available that first allow the male and female canary to become accustomed to one another without allowing contact. These cages have a divider down the middle that can be removed when you are ready to allow your canaries to mate.Nests for breeding canaries are available from specialty pet supply providers. If you buy a pre-made nest, you will also need to buy your canaries some nesting material that they can add to the pre-made nest.; , Unless actively breeding, canaries must be kept in their own cages. Males tend to fight and a male might kill the female if she is not ready to breed. Their cages can, however, be kept in the same room.  Breeding usually occurs in the Spring. Canaries like to breed when the temperature is around 70 degrees and there are about 14 hours of light. These conditions can be replicated indoors, in order to promote breeding. Male and female canaries act differently when they are ready to breed.   Male canaries will usually come into condition before the female. Signs that they're ready to mate include dropping their wings when they sing and singing harsher and louder songs. They may also dance around on their perch and be more territorial when other males are nearby. Females will most often begin to tear paper, as if readying a nest, when they come into condition. The most certain sign of their readiness, however, is when their vent appears red and swollen. They may also raise their tails and appear to squat when males are nearby.  This will get the birds used to each other and their behavior with each other will tell you if they are ready to mate.  If you are just using a large cage instead of a breeding cage, simply place the nest in the female's cage. Once the female has begun adding nesting material to her nest, it is a sign that she is getting ready to mate., Nesting canaries should be fed a proper diet that consists of enriched seed, soft food, and additional calcium from a few weeks before breeding until they are done feeding their chicks.A cuttle-bone or grit is recommended to give the hen the additional calcium required for producing healthy eggs. These speciality foods are available through pet supply companies.  This can be indicated by kissing between the canaries and the female beginning to putting nesting material in the nest.If both are in condition, your male and female canaries will begin to "kiss" through the bars of the wire partition by touching beaks. Kissing may happen right away or it may take a few days after you place the canaries near each other. Once they are ready to breed, you can put them in the same cage.   Watch for any fighting. If they begin to fight, separate them immediately and watch for signs that they're still both in condition. However, mating can be relatively aggressive, so be sure that you are not witnessing breeding instead of regular fighting.  This will begin with the male courting the female canary. Once she is ready, she will crouch down, signaling her willingness. The male will then mount the female is short, successive bursts., The female canary can lay anywhere from 2 to 6 eggs.The female will lay one egg a day, usually in the morning. It typically takes 14 days for canary chicks to hatch. They should hatch without any assistance.  Then, gradually, the father will take over feeding the chicks, making sure that they get enough to eat.Once the chicks begin eating on their own and are fully fledged, meaning their wing feathers have developed enough to fly, you may remove them to their own cage.   At this point you should also separate the parents again as well.  

purchase breeding supplies.  keep canaries separated until time to breed.  watch for signs that the canaries are in "condition," which means they are ready to breed.  place the male and female canaries near each other, but not in the same cage.put their cages side by side or place both birds in a special breeding cage that has a central divider.  add a nest to the female's side of the breeding cage.  feed a proper diet.  place the canaries together once there are signs that the canaries are ready to breed.  watch for breeding behavior.  look for eggs in the nest.  keep the chicks with the male and female canaries until they begin eating on their own, usually they are around 3 weeks of age.at first the mother canary will stay with the babies all the time and the father will bring the mother food.

 Your staff should have information regarding what is expected of them in the workplace and how to work with disabled employees.Written policy manuals are required under the law of many states.Make sure every employee has his or her own copy of the employee handbook as soon as possible after hiring.; , Continuing education demonstrates your commitment to anti-discrimination and can be used as evidence that you take workplace discrimination seriously.   Federal and state employment discrimination agencies have representatives available to speak to your employees regarding compliance with state and federal law.Employees should understand how to recognize and eliminate physical barriers that inhibit the movement of people with physical disabilities.Employees also should understand that harassment or intimidation of other employees because of their physical or mental disability will not be tolerated., State and federal agencies have materials available that you can post in employee break rooms and other areas.   Employees should understand that every effort will be made to accommodate their disabilities provided they inform a supervisor of their disability and their need for accommodation. Uniform orientation programs ensure every employee has received the same information regarding your policies and rules and understand your standards of conduct and professionalism in the workplace.You may be required, either by state or federal law, to post notices informing employees of their right to be free from disability discrimination, and how to request reasonable accommodation of a disability.Keep in mind that employees often turn to state or federal agencies because they feel they have nowhere else to turn. Communicating your concern about workplace discrimination freely will encourage employees to reach out to you first, before they file a claim and escalate the issue., Your supervisors should understand that when a request is made, every effort must be taken to provide the requested accommodation.   Often accommodation of a disability will be simple. For example, if you have an employee who cannot stand for more than 30 minutes at a time, and she is working at a cash register where employees regularly stand for four hours at a time, accommodating her disability is simply a matter of making a stool available for her so she can sit.If the requested accommodation requires actions or expenses beyond that supervisor's immediate power, he or she should pass on the request as soon as possible to someone capable of addressing it. Supervisors or managers should understand that they must avoid asking employees or potential employees about their disabilities, even if a physical disability seems obvious. It is up to the employee to request accommodation. 

include statements about disability discrimination in your employee handbook.  provide regular training courses.  communicate your anti-discrimination policies to all employees.  teach your supervisors how to handle requests for accommodation. 

 Your friends might be able to help you shed some light on your annoying behavior. They can tell you what behavior gets on your nerves and possibly give you some ideas to correct the behavior. Talk to a friend or friends who will tell you their opinion kindly and honestly.You could ask, “I realize that you guys get annoyed with me when I get really hyper. Have you noticed anything about my annoying behavior? I really want to stop it and am trying to figure it out.” Press your friend for specifics. They might be uncomfortable and not want to make you feel bad, and say something like, “Oh, I don’t know, sometimes you just get annoying.” You could say, “What specifically do I do that gets on your nerves?” Acknowledge to your friend that is an uncomfortable conversation for the both of you. You could say, “I really hate talking about this, and I think you do, too, but I really want to change my behavior, so I’d appreciate your insight.” Keep the conversation light: “I know; I drive myself crazy sometimes!”, Don’t try to be someone you’re not. Resist the urge to change who you are just to fit in. You will be unhappy, and you will not be able to cultivate healthy friendships.If you think you need to change yourself to fit in a group, maybe you should change the group instead.  Make new friends by getting involved in new activities at your school, religious organization, or in your community.  Consider spending some time looking at your behavior and understanding why people find you annoying. Figure out what is the underlying reason for the behavior. This might be something you do with an adult you trust or a counselor, or something you do on your own.   For example, do you talk incessantly because you get nervous? Do you mope and drag everyone down because you want to talk to someone about how you really feel? You could try writing in a journal to sort out your behavior and emotions. Journaling helps clarify what you feel and learn more about yourself. 

talk to your friends.  know who you are.  examine your behavior. 

 Different foot measuring gauges may require slightly different procedures for measuring, so start by reading the manufacturer’s directions.  Have your baby sit in someone else’s lap or in a comfortable chair, with his or her knees bent at a 90-degree angle.  Make sure your child’s heel sits against the gauge’s heel rest. Check that the gauge is parallel to the floor and that your baby’s ankles are at a 90-degree angle as well.  Move the toe slide until it touches the tip of your baby’s big toe. Take note of the length measurement shown in the circular window, indicated by the black lines on its sides. Add any extra millimeters in the side panel.   For best results, make sure that your baby’s toes aren’t bent. Gently press them down against the gauge with your thumb as you measure.  Use the width tape to measure. It should be placed automatically at the correct part of the foot. Don’t pull too much; if you do, you may wind up with a tight measurement. Note the width. , If you live in U.K. or E.U., simply go to the Clark size calculator online (at http://www.clarks.co.uk/sizecalculator) and enter your data. The site will tell you the correct shoe size to purchase.   If you live in the U.S., convert your measurements to inches, then consult a children’s shoe size chart (such as http://www.healthyfeetstore.com/kids-shoe-sizing-guide-with-sizing-chart.html) for American measurements.  

consult the user’s manual.  position your child.  fit the gauge to your baby’s foot.  measure the length of your baby’s foot.  determine the width of your baby’s foot.  convert your data to a shoe size. 

 Before initiating such an important conversation, take some time to think about why you want to have this discussion with your parents. Is it because you are secure in your sexuality and confident that you want to live your life openly? Or are you feeling angry, resentful, and overwhelmed? If you are upset or angry, then it may not be the most appropriate time to share this information.There are many reasons why you might choose to come out. It is up to you as an individual to decide when it is a good time and when there is a good reason. For instance, maybe you are very close to your parents and you don't like the distance that keeping a secret creates between all of you. Avoid coming out because of anger. Remember, your sexuality is not a weapon to be used to upset anyone. If you feel that the only result will be a hateful response, consider waiting to have this talk.; , Consider your living situation. Do you depend on your parents for housing and necessities such as food? Or do they pay your college tuition? Think about the possible consequences of coming out. You want to feel pretty confident that your parents will continue to support you.If you are worried about being kicked out of your home, consider waiting to come out until you are financially independent. Consider your safety. Are you scared that one or both of your parents may become violent? Make sure you have a plan to get to a safe space if that occurs. One strategy is to identify a friend who can provide a safe place for you to go if the conversation with your parents does not go well. This space can also give your parents time to reflect on the conversation so you can have a follow-up conversation. You also want to think about the possible benefits of coming out. For example, this could make your relationship with your parents much stronger. You might also feel emotionally better and a huge relief knowing that you don't have to keep your sexual identity a secret.  Try having a variety of plans ready. For example, if your parents are open to listening to you, figure out exactly how much you want to share. Or, if your parents are angry, what will you do? Will you give them space? Make sure that, whatever you decide, you are respectful and understand it may take your parents some time to absorb what you've told them.Make a plan in case your parents are not supportive. Are you prepared to cut off contact with them? Do you have a safe place to stay, if necessary? If your parents request space, or if they no longer seem to be hearing you, don't press the issue, as this may increase the stress and tension in the moment. Try to set an agreed-upon date and time to have a follow-up conversation. your parents may not be able to process any more information until they can fully absorb what you have already shared.  Preparing to come out can be a really emotional experience. It is perfectly normal to feel anxious or even scared. Having a good support system can be really helpful in this situation. Before coming out to your parents, make sure that you have at least one ally.Maybe you've already come out to one or more close friends. Ask them to support you before and after your talk with your parents. You can also seek support from your college or community's LGBT support center. Anyone that you really trust can be an ally for you. Talk to the person about your plan to come out to your parents. Find someone in your support group who is willing to let you stay with them if things do not go well during the discussion.  This is an important conversation so it is a good idea to be as prepared as possible. Try writing down what you want to say before you actually have the discussion. You can even make note cards to keep with you. They can help you to make sure that you have said everything you want to say.Try practicing with a friend or relative. They can help you figure out the right words. At the very least, try to at least figure out what you want to use as your opening line. You might say, "Mom, Dad, I have something to tell you. Please listen to me with an open heart and an open mind."  , Your parents might be very surprised by your news. Try not to startle them even more by telling them your story as they are on their way out the door to work, for instance. Instead, look for a time where your parents are relaxed and able to give you their full attention.It's also important to choose the right place. In many cases, it might be best to do this in private. Your living room might be a good choice. However, if you have any concerns about your safety, a public place might be a better choice. You could consider a coffee shop. Or you could go to a relative's house if they are supportive of you.  

examine your motivation.  think about risks and benefits.  consider different scenarios.  find an ally.  organize your thoughts.  choose the right time and place. 

 You will find that there is no shortage of painters in the telephone book or on the Internet offering their services for hire. For this reason, it is imperative that you ask at least 3 to come into your home and assess the job before you hire a painter.; , You probably got painter recommendations from family or friends, and that is a great place to start. Once the painters have given you estimates, ask them for a list of references that you can call on your own to verify the quality of their work and client satisfaction.  After you have narrowed down your choices and checked their references, don't forget to ask for licenses and proof of insurance. In addition, dig a little deeper and call the Better Business Bureau to find out if there are any complaints filed against any of the painters you are considering for the job.  When you are calling the references, ask the homeowners if they mind you coming over for a quick look at the paint job. Be sure to visit new jobs as well as older jobs so that you can see for yourself how well the craftsmanship has held up over time.  Not all paint adheres to surfaces without some problems after it dries. You don't want to find yourself looking at freshly painted walls that are suddenly bubbling or flaking without a promise that the contractor will come back and fix her work.  The paperwork should include all the essential details, including name, address, office and cell numbers, license number and an itemization of the work you have agreed upon. Have the painter attach a copy of his insurance policy in the event that something gets broken.  

find a minimum of 3 contractors to give you estimates.  check their references.  verify the painter's credentials.  visit a few worksites.  ask the painter if she will guarantee her work.  insist on a contract. 

 If you notice a tear in your glasses, take your glasses to the place of purchase. See if there is anything that can be done.   Depending on your prescription and the level of damage, your eye doctor may be able to make repairs to your lenses.If your eyeglasses are insured, you may be able to get replacement lenses depending on your insurance policy and how the glasses were damaged., While there are many YouTube videos in existence that provide instructions on removing scratches, be careful when consulting them. Attempts to buff out scratches on lenses will change the optics of the lens causing distortions. Unless you have familiarity with DIY repairs, it might not be the best idea to attempt to repair cracked lenses on your own. If you damage the lenses further, this could void any warranties or insurances policies on your glasses., Wearing glasses with scratches will not result in any permanent damage to your vision. Many people wear scratched glasses until they receive a new pair without trouble; however, there are some concerns to keep in mind when wearing scratched or damaged glasses.Eye strain and headaches can result from wearing scratched or damaged lenses, so be take your glasses off if you notice any physical symptoms.Be careful driving. Scratched glasses can obstruct vision. If you do not feel comfortable driving with scratched lenses, use public transportation until your glasses are fixed. 

bring your glasses to the place of purchase.  use precaution when consulting youtube videos.  take caution when wearing glasses with scratched lenses. 

 Do no microwave the entire head of garlic, as this can ruin it for later nights. Simply remove the cloves you plan on using right then.  With the garlic on a small plate, heat them up briefly on high. You should notice the skin billowing and loosening.  Cut the root end off with a knife and the skin will slide off easily.        

remove the cloves you need from the head.  put the garlic clove/s in the microwave for 5-10 seconds.  cut away the loose remaining skin. 

 The goal of technology is to increase efficiency and save time, so if it takes a small team of full-time employees to maintain your technology, or your staff is constantly running into problems, then it is not working for you. Opt for the solutions that take the least time and effort to set up and maintain., Old computers may save money, but seconds spent every day booting up or waiting while machines grind away can add up across your workforce. Investing in new computers not only saves time, it shows your employees that you care about giving them the best tools available. They will reward you by giving you their best work., Workers who do some of their work remotely have been shown to be more productive. Another great way to boost productivity is to work during “bonus” time such as a commute or while waiting for appointments. To take advantage of this type of work, your employees need the right technology.    Laptops – Laptops are key for allowing employees to work remotely, but only if they sync with office computers and programs.  Smart phones and tablets – They allow workers to check their email and edit documents while on the go.  Programs that sync across multiple devices – Whatever is on your worker’s desktop computers should be available on their laptops, smart phones, and tablets as well. This creates a connected, flexible workforce. If employees can only access certain programs at their desk, then you lose valuable flexibility that could let them put in more hours.  Collaborative technology – Invest in business social network software like Tibbr, Jive, and Yammer, and use communication services like Skype and Google Hangouts to keep your employees connected even when they are off site.The Cloud – Moving your business onto the cloud makes work easier to share and accessible from anywhere., Think of all the time your employees spend checking in with one another to be sure tasks have been completed, or discussing their progress in meetings. Virtual task tracking software like Flow, HiTask, Producteev and Asana allows team members to instantly update their progress on a project so that other team members can access the information from anywhere.This allows for shorter meetings, less back and forth email, and thus greater efficiency., These inexpensive programs, like Todoist, Wunderlist, Task, and Pocket List, allow you to prioritize your tasks based on deadlines or other parameters, thereby ensuring that projects are finished on time., Programs designed for specific functions, like customer relations management for instance, are much more powerful and easier to use for those tasks than more generalized programs like Excel. Boost productivity by purchasing task-specific software. 

purchase technology that works with a minimum of time and effort.  get workers the computers they need.  provide the technology your workers need to work wherever they are.  use virtual meeting and task tracking.  have your employees use to-do list applications.  invest in multiple programs for specific tasks, rather than trying to do more with one program. 

 Older dogs commonly begin experiencing joint and muscle problems, and they can become frustrated with their discomfort and impairments.If your dog is grumpy or irritable during the end stages of life, simply do your best to be patient and provide the other comforts you can at home.; , Chaos around the home will only stress both you and your dog as you’re trying to spend the final hours of your dog’s life together meaningfully and with compassion. Give your dog a quiet environment away from noisy children or other animals in the house.Soft, unobtrusive music can also be calming, or you may also use a nature soundtrack with birdsong and the sounds of running water., Reassure your dog that he’s not alone and speak in soft comforting tones. Tell him “good boy” and the other phrases you normally use for positive reinforcement to let him know it’s okay. Give him plenty of light pets as well.   If you want to make sure you’re there for the final moments, then you may choose to sleep next to his bed in a sleeping bag for the final nights., If your dog has a favorite dog bed, put it down for him. Otherwise you can put down some other blankets to help him lay down comfortably.Your dog may also have difficulty regulating his body temperature at the end, so keep some blankets handy to put over him in the event that he shows signs of being cold.Elderly dogs are also prone to pressure sores, so put down extra cushioning for an older dog.On a practical note, he may also have problems with incontinence at the end. Choose a spot you can easily clean and bedding you can wash later. If your dog does have any accidents, then clean them up patiently without scolding him. He can’t help it.If your dog gets cold, you can also use a heater in the area to make him more comfortable.  Hydration is still important to keeping your dog comfortable even in the final hours. Provide a bowl of water next to the dog bed, so your dog doesn’t have to get up to drink. If your is having trouble rising even to drink, then use a clean dropper to help provide water., If your dog has always had a favorite thing to eat, then you should make some of it in case he’s hungry. However, it is pretty common for dogs to lose their appetite in the end stages of life, so don’t force him to eat if he’s not hungry.Solid food may also upset your dog’s stomach at the end as certain systems related to digestion begin shutting down. If your dog still shows a willingness to eat but regular food is upsetting his stomach, then try mixing some baby food with water, or you can also try the Hills A/D diet, which is liquid., If your dog still has enough time and you’re worried about pain in the final stages, then you can consult your vet for pain management options for the final days.Signs that your dog might be in pain include excessive panting or gasping for breath or reluctance to move., Once your dog passes, give him one final hug and say goodbye. It’s a very painful moment, so remember that it’s perfectly okay to cry, but also remember the good times you had with your pet and that he passed in a comfortable, loving environment with you doing everything you could.   Be aware that some dogs seem to "move" or "take a breath" after passing away. As their nervous system shuts down, sometimes muscles in the body or lungs can spasm and look like a sign of life.It’s also common for dogs to pass with their eyes open.You can close them if you want as you say your final goodbye, or you can pull one of the blankets over his head.  Once your pet has passed, know that you did everything you could and worry about taking care of yourself. Seek comfort in other loved ones who understand the loss. You can also light candles or say a small prayer for your pet if it feels right and helps.   The ASPCA also has a hotline you can call to talk to someone who understands the difficulty of losing a pet. You can reach this hotline at 1-877-GRIEF-10.  Though it’s unpleasant, you do have to do something with your pet’s remains once he passes. Many people choose to cremate pets or bury them whether in a pet cemetery or closer to home.Many services are available to help you deal with the remains to make the process easier on you. Look online or ask your vet for services in your area that will help with the option of your choosing.  

stay patient with your dog.  provide a quiet environment.  speak in comforting tones.  put down comfortable bedding.  keep fresh water available.  prepare some of his favorite meal.  see your veterinarian about pain management.  hug your dog one final time.  take care of yourself.  handle your pet’s remains. 

 Fill the bottle so that the water is about 1        , This is where you will be able to see if you constructed the cap correctly. If you attach the pen to the bike pump and it doesn't leak when put upside down, it's ready to for your countdown.         If you are struggling with this step, you could secure the pump using tape or some gum. It'll still propel into the sky, and may even go higher if something is resisting it's flight.  Don't be a jerk and point at somebody. Also, it's a good idea to steer clear of any neighboring windows. If your fins are secure and well portioned, the rocket should should upwards.  You are creating a fuel by each pump you send to rocket. It can't fly with only a few pumps. Continue pumping air into the rocket until it takes off.          Be sure any kids or friends aren't too close while you pump. The water will gurgle after each pump.  Instead of using the pen cartridge in the plastic cap, you could just use the bike pump. Remove the cap. Wrap the bike pump with tape or until it seems like it will be a tight fit into the mouth of the bottle. Stick the pump directly into the water bottle.   If you did this correctly, you should have to really work for the bike pump's hose to fit into the bottle.  

add water into the bottle.  attach to a bike pump.  position your rocket.  pump air into the bottle.  use an alternative system. 

 To make a rainbow smoothie, you need to blend different combinations of fruit together to make the different colored layers. So along with your ingredients, you'll also need:   Seven sealable freezer bags or freezer-safe bowls with airtight lids. Sharp knife and flat surface for preparing the fruit. Strainer for draining the washed berries. Blender and a mixing spoon. Five large cups. Alternatively, you can pour one smoothie and freeze the rest of the prepared fruit for later. This recipe makes about 12.5 cups (3 L) of smoothie, or five 2.5-cup (591 ml) servings; , As you prepare the fruit, it’s important to keep it all separated until your ready to combine the ingredients for the different layers. To wash and cut the fruit:   Peel the bananas and orange. Leave the bananas whole. Chop the orange into one-inch (2.5-cm) chunks. Wash the raspberries under running water and place them in a strainer to dry off. Repeat with the blueberries, spinach, and strawberries. Cut the stems off the strawberries. Wash the peach and cut it in half to remove the pit. Cut the peach into quarters. Wash the beet and cut off the tail and the stem. Cut the beet into quarters. Peel the pineapple and mango. Cut the fruit from around the core of the pineapple and the pit of the mango. Cut the fruit into one-inch (2.5-cm) chunks.  This rainbow smoothie will have seven layers in total: purple, blue, red, magenta, green, yellow, and orange. Place the fruit bunches into separate freezer bags once it’s all divided out.   Purple layer: combine half a banana and the blueberries. You can also substitute mixed berries or blackberries. As you portion out the bananas for the different layers, cut them into one-inch (2.5-cm) chunks.Blue layer: one banana and ½ cup (82.5 g) of pineapple. You will use the food coloring to turn this blue. Red layer: half a banana, and ¼ cup each of raspberries (31.25 g) and strawberries (50 g). Magenta layer: half a banana, the beet, and ¼ cup each of raspberries (31.25 g) and strawberries (50 g). Green layer: one banana, the spinach, and ½ cup (82.5 g) of pineapple. For a more vibrant green, add ¼ of an avocado as well.Yellow layer: one banana and ½ cup (82.5 g) of pineapple. Orange layer: half a banana, the peach, the orange, and the mango.  It's important to start with frozen fruit, because this will give the smoothies the right consistency and help the layers stay separated. You can add lots of ice to a regular smoothie, but that will dilute the colors.   Once all the fruit is divided and portioned into bags or bowls, place it in the freezer for a few hours or overnight., To make each smoothie layer, you will also need yogurt and orange juice, or another liquid for blending. Keep these ingredients cold and in the fridge until you're ready to assemble your smoothie.   You can use Greek, regular, coconut, or soy yogurt for the smoothies. Each smoothie color will require ¼ cup (61 g) of yogurt. Good blending liquids for the smoothies include coconut milk, water, and dairy or non-dairy milk. Each smoothie color will require about 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of liquid.  To make an accurate rainbow, start with magenta on the bottom, followed by purple, blue, green, yellow, orange, and finally red on top.   In the bottom of the blender, pour in ¼ cup (61 g) of yogurt and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of orange juice. Then add the fruit for the magenta layer, which is banana, beet, raspberries, and strawberries.Always add the liquids to the blender first, as this will prevent air bubbles from forming. When you start up the blender, start on a low speed. As the fruit chunks get smaller, increase the speed until the mixture is smooth and free of chunks. As you blend, add more orange juice if you need to loosen up the fruit. You can also turn off and unplug the blender to stir the smoothie if necessary.  Place ¼ to 1/3 cup of magenta smoothie into the bottom of each glass. You want about the same quantity of each color per smoothie, which will work out to roughly a one-inch (2.5-cm) layer of each color. To make even and flat layers, pack the smoothie layer down with the spoon. Place the glasses into the freezer until you're ready to add another layer.If you're only making one smoothie, pour the remaining magenta smoothie back into the freezer bag and save it for later. When the blender is empty, rinse it out with warm water so that you don’t mix colors making your next layer., Make the purple layer next by adding the yogurt, juice, and fruit. Repeat using the same process as you did for the magenta layer. When you're ready to pour, remove the glasses from the freezer and spoon in a one-inch (2.5-cm) thick layer (on top of the magenta.) Pack it down and return the cup to the freezer.   When you're making the blue layer, don’t forget to add the food coloring, otherwise you'll have another layer of yellow. The food coloring is necessary because blue fruits, such as blueberries, actually turn purple when blended. If you don’t want to use artificial food coloring, you can find natural food coloring, or skip the blue layer.  Leave the individual fruit combinations in the freezer until you're ready to make that layer. This will help keep the fruit layers frozen, which will keep the colors from blending together. For each fruit layer:   Add the yogurt and orange juice first. Blend the mixture until smooth, adding more liquid if necessary. Remove the glasses from the freezer and spoon in a one-inch layer of smoothie on top of the previous layer. Return the glasses to the freezer until you add the next layer. Place any unused smoothie back into the freezer. Rinse out the blender.  You can serve the smoothies with either a spoon or a straw. As long as you keep the leftover fruit colors separate in the freezer, you can easily make more rainbow smoothies another day.  

gather your supplies.  wash and cut the fruit.  combine the fruit for the different layers.  freeze the fruit.  chill the liquids.  blend the fruit for the magenta layer.  make the first layer of the rainbow.  blend the fruit for the purple and then blue layers.  repeat until you have a full rainbow.  serve and enjoy!

 Try to put any business appointment in writing (most preferably in Italian), so you have something to show if things don't work out according to plan. It is also helpful to confirm the meeting by a call, email or a fax––anything that results in reminding those attending the meeting that it's still happening.   Try not to schedule meetings in August unless those meeting with you make it clear they'll be available. Many businesses are closed during these period and people are on holiday; it could be awkward if someone feels compelled to fly back to Rome just to meet with you.  Italian business, particularly in the northern regions, value the punctuality of others. Prompt attendance at a meeting also says a lot about your reliability and enthusiasm, so it's best to be five minutes early than five minutes late.   Should those you are meeting turn up late (Italian business people outside of the northern regions are less concerned with their own punctuality than perhaps with yours), do not make an issue out of it. Accept apologies and move on as if nothing untoward has happened. You can surmise whatever you want from it after the meeting but during the meeting it is best to appear unruffled and ready to make deals.  This helps you colleagues; moreover, it also makes them appreciate your effort. It will help them to see that you are serious about doing business with them.  This will ensure that the conversation runs more smoothly and that there are no misunderstandings. Do not rely on the ability of the other business people to speak English; that is too much of a burden for you to place upon them. It also leaves you at risk of not understanding what you really need to know.  

make appointments two to three weeks in advance.  be punctual.  have all printed material available in both english and italian.  use an interpreter if you are not fluent in italian. 

 If you have to leave something on the stove to measure an ingredient it could over-thicken or burn quickly. Have everything you need ready and measured ahead of time:   3 tablespoons butter 3 tablespoons flour 2 cups warmed liquid (chicken/beef/vegetable stock, condensed beef broth) Salt and pepper to taste  Optional: 1/2 teaspoon Kitchen Bouquet, onion/garlic powder, paprika.; , Melt the butter on medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Once it is completely liquefied, move on.   You'll be mixing flour into the butter and you do not want any chunks, as this will lead to a lumpy gravy. Whisking flour and hot butter together is the basis of a "roux."  , Stir continuously until the mixture becomes smooth. It is often easiest to add the flour 1 tablespoon at a time, using your whisk to quickly break up chunks and smooth out the sauce. You should notice it thickening.   The longer you cook the flour, the darker and richer it will get. For a light gravy, move on as it turns tan. For a rich brown gravy, keep stirring and cook for an extra 3-5 minutes. Butter and flour give the gravy its thick, rich base. You can add more of both for a richer, thicker gravy, keeping the 2 cups of liquid the same, but keep the ratio of flour and butter equal., Warm the liquid up in a separate pot or in the microwave before adding it. Only pour it in 1/4 cup at a time, whisking it in well before adding the next bit. You don't want to cause any rapid temperature changes in your gravy.There are a lot of options for liquids here, and it all depends on the meal you are serving. Traditionally, brown gravy has a beef base (which gives it its color), made with either beef bouillon and water or beef broth. Some other options include:   2 cups beef stock. 1 can condensed beef broth. You can also mix in some milk or water for a lighter gravy, but keep the ratios (2 cups total) the same.  As soon as the gravy starts to boil, lower the heat and let it simmer until it is as thick as you want it.   The gravy will also thicken a bit as it cools, so take it off the stove 1-2 minutes before your desired consistency.  Add a pinch of salt and pepper as it simmers, as well as any other flavorings your desire. 1/2 teaspoon of Kitchen Bouquet, a browning and seasoning mixture common in many gravies, is a great way to get "classic" gravy flavor and coloring. Other options include:   1/2 teaspoon garlic and/or onion powder 1/2 teaspoon paprika 1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme and rosemary Dash of Worcestershire sauce., Either pour over meat slices directly before serving or pour into a small serving jug and place on the table for diners to serve themselves from.  

measure out everything before beginning.  melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan.  sprinkle in 3 tablespoons of white flour, whisking constantly.  add your 2 cups of warmed liquid slowly and bring to a boil.  lower the heat after boiling and let simmer until your desired thickness.  season the gravy to taste.  serve while still warm. 

 If your vehicle did not come equipped with a turbocharger from the factory, you can install one on a normally aspirated motor to significantly increase power output. A turbocharger uses the exhaust flowing out of the motor to power a turbine fan that forces compressed air into the engine. Turbocharging a vehicle requires a number of supporting modifications to the vehicle’s fuel system. The internal components of your engine, such as pistons and rods, may also need to be replaced to withstand the added stress.Remember that adding forced induction like a turbocharger requires an increase in fuel to support the added air. Kits for your specific vehicle may be available that include all of the components required to turbocharge it.  A supercharger works by forcing compressed air into the engine just like a turbocharger does, but it is powered by the serpentine or an accessory belt instead of by the exhaust. Because superchargers are belt driven, they are not as efficient as turbochargers but are favored by those who value power at lower RPMs.Superchargers require supporting fuel modifications just like turbochargers. Supercharger kits often come with a bracket and larger serpentine belt to support the addition of the supercharger pulley. Unlike turbochargers, there is no need to wait for the turbo to spool. Superchargers produce power at all RPMs.  Nitrous oxide contains more oxygen than atmospheric air, so injecting nitrous into your vehicle’s engine works in much the same was as a turbocharger or supercharger. “Wet” nitrous kits inject a combination of nitrous and fuel into the cylinders and can produce more power safely than “dry” kits which inject only nitrous. Most four cylinder motors can withstand up to eighty horsepower worth of nitrous oxide being injected without suffering any adverse effects.Make sure to order a nitrous kit designed for your vehicle if you don’t have the tools or skill set to fabricate the components you need to install the kit. Unlike other forms of forced induction, nitrous oxide only increases wear on the engine while armed.  After installing a form of nitrous or forced induction, it’s important to have your vehicle tuned to support the increase in power. Taking your vehicle to a professional tuning shop will allow them to use a dynamometer to test various air/fuel ratios at different RPMs, ensuring the maximum power output at each point in the vehicle’s power band.The price to have your vehicle “dyno-tuned” varies from location to location. Dyno-tuning can free up significant amounts of power from the modifications you’ve already installed.  

turbocharge your vehicle.  supercharge your vehicle.  use a wet or dry nitrous oxide kit.  have your vehicle professionally tuned.

 Being first chair (or concertmaster) is gratifying, because it means that your orchestra director trusts you to lead and occasionally perform solos. However, all that leadership comes with big responsibilities. If music is a priority for you and you feel dedicated to the ensemble you play in, then you just might make a wonderful first chair.Ask yourself some of these questions so you’ll know how to approach your goal:   Will you be able to attend all rehearsals? Do you have time to practice, so that you know your music well enough for others to follow you? Do you like helping others if they’re stuck? How will you support the orchestra if you don’t get first chair? This is important, because there can only be one first chair. If you don’t end up getting it, will you still be dedicated to the group?; , Some orchestras have tests for first chairs once every two weeks or so. Others have a constant first chair throughout the semester or even the year. Still others allow challengers to compete against the current first chair--each musician plays the same piece, and your teacher or director picks the best performance. Know how you have to try out so that you can prepare yourself.   Check if your orchestra has age limits on who can be first chair. If only eighth-graders are allowed to be first chair and you’re a seventh-grader, spend the year practicing so you’ll perform incredibly next year. If your orchestra’s first-chair system relies on challenges, don’t challenge the current first chair too often. Challenges take up class time, so you don't want to do them frequently. Also, you might get a reputation as being difficult.  The best first chairs aren’t divas. Instead, they’re aware that they set an example for the rest of the ensemble, in performance and in rehearsal. If you want to be a good leader, you have to focus on other’s needs as well as your own.   Be courteous to your fellow musicians. Be early for rehearsals, don’t hog sheet music or stands, and don’t trash-talk anyone else’s style.Be available for help when others need it. If someone asks you for advice on their playing, it means that they trust you.  There’s just no getting around it. It takes a lot of effort and dedication to become first chair. You need to make sure that you’re the best musician you can be, and the best way to get there is by practicing often and well.   Set aside time every day. If you go to school and have other extracurriculars, you probably feel really busy. Promise yourself that you’ll practice a certain amount of time every day, and arrange your schedule so that you can make that happen.Practice in a consistent space. If you can, set up an area--maybe in your bedroom or living room--with a chair, music stand, and mirror (so you can check your posture). This will help you think of music practice as a normal part of your schedule., Many of the most dedicated musicians in your orchestra probably already work one-on-one with a teacher. In private lessons, you can improve your technique even more than you can with practice, because your teacher can point out strengths and weaknesses in your performance that you wouldn’t notice otherwise. This can be enough to give you an edge.   What you say will depend on your history with your instrument and your relationship with your parents. Pick a quiet time, like when you're driving or doing the dishes together, and say "I've been thinking that I'd like to try private instruction so I can get better at violin. Is that something I could do?" If your parents can't get you private lessons, do your best to accept it. You can still improve a lot by practicing and attending orchestra.  Will you be playing a movement, or just a few phrases? Will you be performing for just your teacher or conductor, or the whole class? Make sure you’re prepared for the structure of the tryout, so you start with a confident, unruffled air about you., The night before the audition, gather your family together and play all your audition material exactly as you plan to the next day. This will help you know what it’s like to perform for an audience in a relatively low-pressure way. It will also check that you have all your material memorized (if necessary).If you make a mistake, don’t say so. Keep going and do your best. If you have very snarky or giggly siblings, then you don’t have to play for them. Just your parent(s) or guardians will do.  Imagining yourself playing amazingly doesn’t replace practice, but it definitely helps. Before you go to sleep at night, close your eyes and imagine yourself playing confidently and well at your tryout. The day of your performance, your brain will be used to picturing what you need to do, so it will go more smoothly., Whether it’s a challenge or audition, you want to do everything you can to set yourself up for success. Give yourself plenty of time the night before and the morning of your try-out, so you don’t feel rushed.   Prep your instrument. Before you leave your house in the morning, remember to take your instrument with you. Make sure that it’s clean and that you have all the parts you need. Pack extra reeds or rosin if you need them. Get a good night’s sleep. You’ll perform your best if you’re alert. Eat a good breakfast. Some performers say that eating a banana helps them calm their nerves.Really, the important thing is to eat food that makes you feel full and energetic. Wear something lucky (if you have it). You’ll be relying on your musicianship and preparation, of course, but your favorite t-shirt or necklace just might be the boost of confidence you need., Before your try-out, make sure you’re taking deep, slow breaths to calm your body. If you’ve worked hard and practiced to get to where you are, you deserve to feel proud of yourself. Whatever the results of the tryout or challenge are, they’re second to your dedication to your instrument. You can’t do a yoga pose to de-stress yourself in the middle of your audition, but you think some happy thoughts:   You’re a musician, so you belong in an orchestra, and you deserve to take a shot to be a student leader.Your teacher or conductor is rooting for you and wants you to play well.You have set a goal for yourself, and that’s admirable.  Not to sound like a broken record, but an orchestra is a group of people who come together with the same goal: to make beautiful music. Every person there, including you, contributes to that. With that in mind, try to accept your director’s decision as gracefully as you can.If you don’t get first chair this time, it’s okay--you worked really hard, and you’re going to continue to improve. Congratulate the first chair, and then concentrate on making yourself and the group sound good. If you get first chair, try to look ahead to your new responsibilities: you have so much to do!  , Now that you’re in the position of the concertmaster, it’s extra-important for you to model good practices for your fellow musicians. You’ve probably been on your best behavior for a while now, but it’s always good to refresh yourself. Do you have habits that are getting in the way, like tapping your toes to keep tempo? It’s time to address them.Always be early to rehearsals, so you’re fully prepared to start at the beginning. Your director probably already says “Early is on time, on time is late,” anyway.  Stay alert. If you start daydreaming and lose your place, you won’t be able to lead your group as well as you could otherwise. If you notice anyone playing really beautifully, feel free to compliment them (after rehearsal). You’re all there to sound beautiful together.  Again, there’s simply no way to avoid it. Practicing will make your performances crisper and more artistic. Once you have your basic fingerings down, you will play more confidently at rehearsal. Practice so you can both play well and lead your section more effectively!   If you’re first chair, you might even get a solo. Practice extra hard so you sound your best. Listen to recordings of your part when you’re doing other things, like walking to school or falling asleep., If you’re ever feeling stressed or stuck, the conductor of your ensemble is your best source of guidance. Whether you’re trying to get a particular phrase down perfectly or worried about conflict in the group, you don’t have to solve all the orchestra’s problems by yourself.Be direct when you ask for help. Say something like "I'm having trouble getting the first few bars of the second movement right. Do you have any advice about how to make it sound more natural?" To avoid tattling, don't use anyone's name. If there is a lot of internal conflict and rivalry in your orchestra, it’s not your job to solve it.  At the end of the day, everything you do as first chair--even your amazing solo--is done with the goal of making the whole orchestra sound great. Focus on lifting up your stand mate, your section, and your whole group, blend, and be a supportive presence, and you’ll make beautiful music with your fellow musicians. 

ask yourself why you want it.  learn the requirements.  be kind to your section mates.  practice.  ask your parents if you can take private lessons.  review the material and tryout process for first chair.  hold a mini-concert for your family.  visualize a good performance.  be prepared the day of the testing.  relax.  be gracious no matter the outcome.  act like a leader.  keep practicing.  ask for help if you need it.  focus on the group.

  To translate what you do in Finder to a written path, start by clicking 'Macintosh HD' on your desktop. This will become '/'. Click the next folder. The name will follow the '/' so type another '/' before any more folder names. For example, if the folder you are having issues with is 'Macintosh HD' -> 'Applications', the path to this folder is '/Applications'. If the problem folder was the 'Utilities' folder inside 'Applications', the path would be '/Applications/Utilities'.        Type cd /path (example: cd /Applications) then press Return.; ,  Type cd in terminal followed by a space       Find the folder with the issue but DON'T OPEN IT, drag its icon into terminal. Watch it complete the path for you. Press Return.  

method 1: use the 'cd' (change directory) command along with the path to the folder in need of repair.  method 2: we can use the 'cd' command and drag the folder to terminal which automatically completes the path building process for you. 

 Go to class prepared--look at your class syllabus and write down which texts you should read before each class. Make a schedule for how much reading you will do every day. It’s important to do the reading before class so that you understand the lecture or discussion while it’s happening, rather than being confused and unprepared in the moment.  While you read, take notes where you summarize what’s happening in your own words, note unfamiliar words, and write your thoughts down. Reread a text if you find it dense or confusing the first time--sometimes professors and teachers choose challenging texts that deserve a second look. In order to maximize productivity, take a ten minute break for every fifty minutes that you read.  Keep a dictionary near where you study, and write down the names and definitions of unfamiliar words you come across. If your teacher or professor allows it, use websites such as Sparknotes, Shmoop, and BookRags for plot summaries and refreshers on character names. These sources, however, should only serve to supplement your basic knowledge of the assigned texts. All your thinking and ideas for your essays should come only from you.  Maybe you have a good friend in the class with whom you can chat over coffee or you want to organize a weekly study group. Talking about the assigned texts in a group can help you gain new understandings of the text, answer your questions, and get further enjoyment out of what you read. If your literature class has exams, your study group can help you review the important plot points, details, and themes in the assigned texts.  

do your reading before class.  read and reread the assigned texts carefully.  use outside tools to help you understand the assignments further.  talk about the assigned texts with people in your class. 

 Since the infection often does not produce any observable symptoms, it is important to get regular checkups. Try to see your physician at least once every six months.   You might exhibit symptoms anywhere from several weeks to 10 years after initial infection.  There are a number of tests a doctor might run to determine if you have cysticercosis. You might, for instance, get a blood test to detect antibodies against the pork tapeworm. You might also get a biopsy, in which a needle is used to extract a small portion of your body’s tissue and look for signs of tapeworms. Finally, you might have an imaging exam such as an X-ray, CT or MRI scan, or an ultrasound to get a better idea of where the cysts are., Steroids are also useful for preventing adverse effects brought on by other anti-tapeworm medications.  Two common drugs are albendazole and praziquantel. Praziquantel is a medication designed specifically for treating flatworms and flukes. Albendazole is a more generalized medication useful for treating a variety of parasitic infections, but tends to be the preferred treatment method for cysticercosis.  Talk to your doctor about alternative options before getting surgery to treat cysticercosis.  

contact your doctor immediately.in order to limit the impact of your infection, and prevent you from infecting others, it is important to seek treatment as soon as you become aware of your illness.  get tested.  take steroids.corticosteroids (a class of medications that relieve inflammation) may be prescribed to reduce swelling, especially in the case of cysts located in your eye or brain.  take anti-parasitic drugs.there are several powerful antiparasitic drugs that a doctor might prescribe for you.  get surgery if necessary.in serious cases, especially cases where medication is ineffective, surgery may be necessary to remove cysts. 

, Hover your pointer over Insert, and go down to Indexes and Tables. Then chose the middle "Indexes and Tables." Here, you can insert a title. I just leave this blank because I set up my brief template with the title "Contents" already there. Now, uncheck the box that says, protect against manual changes. This is very important. You want to be able to tweak things after the table is generated.  Now, if you notice at the top, it chooses a whole different style for this table, "Contents 2." Modify this style to your liking and save that just like you did with your heading styles. Save that style so you have a consistent style for your table of contents every time. Now one really cool feature here is that you can right click on the table of contents and "Update Index/Table." This is great for when you made changes to your brief. Perhaps you added a new heading or you wrote more and the page numbers are different. The changes will instantly be reflected. One problem, however, is that once you update, any formatting changes you made after the table was first generated will be erased.  But consider this, if you don't use the above tools, your pdf file at the end of the process will not be navigable based on the contents. Pdf files you can navigate are really useful.  

once you have written your brief, consider the following:  ,  to generate the table of contents, go to the front of your brief where you want the table to appear.  pick okay and you have your table.  if you think making table of contents without using styles and the tools mentioned above is easier, that is fine. 

 This is an ideal approach if you have developed a recognizable, online presence in one or more specific forums.   Send an email or private message to the current forum administrator and express that you are interested in becoming an administrator.  Even if you have not held the official role as forum administrator, you can still demonstrate that you have experience in forum participation and with helping other community members.   Include links on your resume to the online forums you have been participating in. In most cases, prospective employers will join or visit a particular forum to read and review your posts and discussions to verify that you are a qualified candidate for a forum administrator position.  Some websites will pay you to be an administrator; whereas other websites may be looking for volunteers. Examples of search phrases you can use are "forum administrator," "forum moderator," and "forum leader."   Visit major job search websites such as Monster, Indeed, or CareerBuilder to find online forum administrator positions on the Internet. Go to any search engine such as Bing, Google, or Yahoo, and look for online forum administrator openings.  

inquire about forum administrator roles with your current administrator.  add online forum experience to your resume.  search for online forum administrator positions on the internet.

 You can prevent feelings of isolation and loneliness if you expand your social network. One way to do this is to open yourself and learn a new skill or topic.Taking classes or lessons gives you the opportunity to meet people that you might not meet otherwise. It can also keep you from feeling alone and unconnected to others.   For example, take a foreign language class to expose yourself to different cultures and to interact with other people. Try something active like a team sport. This will give you the chance to get some physical activity and widen your social circle.; , This is a way to give back and boost your community as well as support causes you care about. It also helps prevent you from feeling isolated. This is because it gives you the chance to meet people with similar interests and concerns and meet people in your community.Talk to leaders in the community like your religious leader, coach, or a school counselor about ways that you can volunteer. For example, “You might say, I’d like to volunteer, do you have any suggestions?” When possible, volunteer to do things that will allow you to interact with other people. For example, instead of volunteering to stuff envelopes, you might volunteer to meet visitors at an event.  One way that you can connect with others and prevent feelings of isolation is to ask someone close to you to introduce you to new people.Having a mutual friend introduce you to others can help make meeting people less awkward for you.   For example, you might tell your sister, “When we go to the party tonight, would you mind introducing me to a few people since I won’t know anyone?” Or for instance, if you are starting a new job you might ask your HR representative or supervisor to introduce you to key people you may need to know.  In order for you to prevent feelings of isolation and expand your social network, you’ll have to believe that you can meet new people. Believing in yourself will give you the confidence you need to introduce yourself to others and widen your circle of friends.When you meet new people, remind yourself that you are a great person who is capable of making new friends. Try saying, “I believe that I can meet new people. I don’t have to feel isolated or lonely.” Make a list of all the reasons someone would want to spend time with you. For example, you might write, “I’m quirky, thoughtful, interesting, and a great listener.” Give yourself a daily compliment. For instance, when you’re getting dressed in the morning, you could tell yourself, “I’m a great person and I’m going to have a great day with the people around me.”  

learn something new.  volunteer in your community.  ask for an introduction.  believe in yourself. 

 It takes ten obsidian to make a Nether portal. Once you have enough for two portals, however, you can use a trick to get infinite obsidian without needing to find lava.  If you don't have a portal already, place obsidian blocks in a vertical frame 5 tall x 4 wide. Activate it by using a flint and steel on the lowest obsidian block. This trick may not work if there is another portal close by.The corners of the portal do not have to be obsidian.  The Nether is a dangerous place, so prepare yourself if you haven't been before. You'll need the remaining ten obsidian blocks, but you might want to leave them safely behind and explore a safe route first. You'll need to travel a certain minimum distance in a straight, horizontal line (these numbers include a 3-block margin of safety just in case):PC, Pocket Edition, and Console Edition "large" worlds: travel 19 blocks. Console Edition "medium" worlds: travel 25 blocks. Console Edition "classic" worlds (including all PS3 and Xbox 360 worlds): travel 45 blocks. If you have multiple Overworld portals, walk away from their coordinates. This trick will not work if you are too close to an existing portal.  Build this in the Nether and activate it the same way you did the first one. When you walk through it, you should appear in a brand-new portal in the Overworld.   If you appear next to a portal you already built, you did not walk far enough in the Nether. Go back to the Nether and break your portal with a diamond pickaxe, then rebuild it somewhere else.  The portal that just appeared has fourteen obsidian blocks free for the taking. Mine these with a diamond pickaxe.  Each time you walk through the Nether portal you just built, a new portal will appear in the Overworld. Mine this for free obsidian. Speed this up if you want a large amount of obsidian:   Use a bed to set your spawn near the permanent Overworld portal. Place a chest near the temporary Overworld portal. Stash the obsidian and diamond pickaxe in the chest after mining the portal. Kill yourself to return to spawn. Walk through the Nether again and exit the same portal to create a new one. Build a tunnel between the Nether portals to increase safety.  

gather twenty obsidian by other means.  create a nether portal.  travel through the nether.  build a second portal.  mine the obsidian in the overworld portal.  exit the same nether portal to spawn a new one. 

 Each universe is a collection of thousands of players. There is no difference between any of them, except for universe 5, 30, 35, 40, and 42; , You will do this throughout the entire game, but for the beginning stages of the game, this is the main priority. Mines will get you resources (sometimes called "res" for short), which is used to build and research things in the game. Basically, it's the currency of the game.  Defense, as you might guess, deters other OGame players from attacking you to steal your resources.  Before you can, however, you must build a research lab. The more you research, the more things you will be able to build, the faster some ships will be, and various other things which will prove important. The higher your research level the better and quicker things get done. Research is vital so after you can raid start building this up if your a turtle you will want to get laser 6 asap for heavy lasers. If your a raider get those drives up and get impulse to level 6 for the coveted bomber which has rapid fire on every defense.  The most important thing for you is your fleet of ships. You will use your fleet to attack other people.  

register in a universe of your choice.  build mines.  build defense.  research.  build ships. 

 If you can't find tapioca flour, you can use tapioca starch instead; it's the same thing. If you'd like to make this blend using smaller amount, simply use equal parts of all four flours, then add ¼ part of tapioca flour/starch.   If you are allergic to tapioca, use potato starch instead. Do not use potato flour; it's not the same thing.; , The trouble with gluten-free flour is that it is gluten-free. This means that when you use it instead of regular flour in a recipe, you might get slightly different results. Adding xanthan gum is not completely necessary, but it will help bind your ingredients and give you better results., Do not skimp on the blending; if your flours are not well-blended, your baked goods will not turn out right. It will take 3 to 5 minutes of whisking., Depending on the recipe, you can use it as a direct substitute for regular flour. You may have to use a little more/less flour depending on the recipe however. It works great in just about any baked good, including breads, cakes, crepes, muffins, and even waffles. 

pour all four flours into a large bowl.  add the xanthan gum as a gluten replacement and to allow for better binding.  blend the ingredients together well with a whisk.  store the flour in an air-tight container. 

,,   If you have a mechanical pencil, take off the top part (where you usually put in the lead) and put your note in there. Then put the top back on and pass it to your friend. It will seem like you were just lending them a pencil. Alternatively, this also works with pens with caps and removable grips. Just follow the same steps as for mechanical pencils, but keep hold of the removed grip, and pass the pen holding the cap so as to cover the note.  

write your note on a small piece of paper.  ,  roll it up around your pencil.  ,  finally, drop the pencil if your friend sits behind or near you and ask for them to get it for you. 

 Place the two slices of bread in a toaster or toaster oven. Have it toast until golden brown and the edges are a bit brown. Remove bread out of heat using tongs or wearing oven mitts.; , Wash the apple carefully with cold water. Dry it off with a paper towel or rag as wet apples can be slippery while chopping. Slice the apple in two big circles. Place the apple slices on one of the piece's of bread.  On the other piece of bread, spread the butter around the bread slice by lathering a butter knife over it. Sprinkle desired amount of cinnamon on top of the butter. Close the sandwich together by placing the buttered slice of bread on the bread with the apple on it.  Munch and enjoy this easy instant apple pie;  

toast the bread in a toaster oven.  put the apple on the bread.  add the butter and cinnamon and close.  enjoy!

 (It should be called the same thing in every version.); , It should sound similar in every version of Windows. Click once on this option.  (In this case, simply go back and unlock it.) What is here depends on the version of Windows you hold, and each is at least slightly different. As an example, XP has five different options while Vista has only two. What you should look for should have the word “Language” in it.  In Windows 95, 2000, and etc., it is very similar to Windows XP, though certain things many be entitled different things. In XP, simply go to “Add Other Languages” once you arrive at “Pick a Task.” This should be the third option with a green arrow to the left. Click on this. A box should appear that titles itself “Regional and Language Option,” as you could guess. You should be on the tab that says “Languages.” There are two different boxes (that are more than likely unchecked); the first one says “Install files for complex script and right-to-left languages (including Thai),” and the second one says “Install files for East Asian languages.” For the best results, check both boxes. Read what the boxes that pop up have to say.       Unfortunately, in Windows Vista, it is more difficult to access this than any other version of Windows. However, if you fish around after these, it becomes easier to understand. Click on “Regional and Language Options.” A box should pop up, and in this box, click on what should be the third tab, “Keyboards and Languages.” At the very bottom of this, click on the “link” (blue, underlined text) that asks, “How can I install additional languages?” Two boxes should pop up. Depending on how much time and/or space you have, read this first one and click either “Yes” or “No.” Go to the box that has appeared on the very right of your screen. It should be titled “Help and Support.” After you read this information, go back to the second paragraph and click the “link” at the very end that says, “How do I get additional language files?” Read this, and once you understand, you should be able to get the languages you desire.  Then, sit back and let it load. This should take 5-10 minutes (Sometimes 15-20 minutes if your computer's memory is low) to do this. After this, simply restart your computer, and you will now be able to see (and maybe read) other languages!  

go to the start menu, and click on control panel.  there is an option in the control panel that should say something to the effect of “date, time, language, and regional options.” (if you have windows xp, then this is the exact wording.),  you should be in this folder, unless you have locked it in the past.  only after you start the installation and it has already asked for the required cd-rom, put in the cd. 

 If you do not have enough resources, then you will have to wait. Also, research other stuff that are good to, like Gold Mining and Stone Mining (Stone Mining should be researched later unless you want a castle as the "2" buildings).  Universities should be built first because they have fairly priced but powerful upgrades. Monasteries should be built later in the game unless you are planning a siege in the early Castle Age. Continue to create villagers, and research Wheelbarrow or Town Watch (Wheelbarrow may be too expensive, but do not use your food on Town Watch of you have less than 100 food). You must build another Town Center though. More villagers = more resources = better military = better chance that you will crush your opponents.  Build a Barracks, Archery Range, Stable, Siege Workshop, and other buildings. The order is listed below. Barracks Stable Siege Workshop Archery Range , You should have 4 military groups. Continue to build up your military slowly, but DO NOT FORGET ABOUT YOUR ECONOMY!!! If you forget about it, you will not have enough resources to build up your military, well...you will lose. Keep creating more villagers until you think the mark reaches 50 for villagers and 50 for military units (15 infantry, 15 archers, 15 cavalry, and 5 siege units).  This will make it easier, as the economy will boost, leaving you with many resources for the military. When you reach 1000 food, 800 gold, and a castle or 2 Castle Age buildings, you can choose to advance to the Imperial Age and continue to work on your military for an easier win. Or, you can lead your military of 50 troops (it is actually a lot in this game) and destroy everyone. You should advance to the Imperial Age if there are more than 2 enemies, and just attack if there are 2 or less enemies. If you are planning to do the military attack, go ahead and crush everyone. If not, here is what you do in the Imperial Age.  

immediately research heavy plow and bow saw.  build a monastery and a university.  build up your military.  make the infantry in one group, the archers in another, the cavalry in another, and the siege units in another group.  do the economy stuff before the military stuff. 

 The classic treasure hunt clue is a simple couplet, or rhyming lines. These can be easy, like "To find your first clue, look by the glue," or more opaque, such as "We travel together, one black and one white, you only meet us when the food isn't right" (by the salt and pepper)., Draw or take photos of places they should investigate, figuring out where the actual location is. This is a great clue for younger kids, as it lets them get moving quickly. For the older crowd, you can up the ante by using vintage photos, satellite shots, or extreme close-ups for a more difficult hunt., For example, you could get three identical cups. Show the kids which cup you are hiding the clue under, then rapidly mix around the cups. The kids then have to guess which cup contains the clue. You can run egg races, small obstacle courses, or mini scavenger hunts as well, giving out the clue only once the game is complete.This can be a good way to break up the middle of a hunt. Send them off on the first 4-5 clues, then go set up the game for the middle. After the game is over, they can get some food, water, and sunblock before hitting the next 4-5 clues.  The simplest way to make invisible ink is to write something in white crayon, then have the kids go over it with highlighter. You can also make invisible ink, letting the kids figure out what to do with the "blank" clue on their own.For kids of all ages, you could turn all of the lights off in a room so it is pitch black. Tell the kids to search for the clues with flashlights or by feeling around.  You might dunk the clues in a bowl of wet spaghetti "brains," forcing kids to go dig through. If you have some waterproof clues, you can put them in the bottom of the pool, giving kids a chance to jump in and swim (as long as they are supervised). Anything that makes them move and try out different things will be a blast., For example, you can get custom-made puzzles cheaply online, which you can print with a clue. Then, at each smaller clue, you give out a puzzle piece, which build up to reveal one last clue or secret. Other ideas include:   Giving out letters at each clue as part of a word scramble. The scrambled word is a password for another clue, or the answer to reveal the final treasure. Themed questions such as -- "the final answer is the one thing all the other clues have in common," or "the final clue comes from the first letter of all the other clues."  , This is especially fun if you have a themed treasure hunt. For example, you can ask "Where part of the house did Harry Potter have to live in as a kid?" which would send the children scrambling towards the closet for the next clue.   Be sure to check with some kids beforehand, so that these clues are actually relevant or answerable!, This goes well with puzzles or multi-part clues. Write out a map, complete with illustrations and a few intentionally misleading parts (like an "accidentally" erased area). Then, at each location in the map, put a small prize or clue needed to open the final treasure, which prevents kids from racing straight to the end. 

make rhyming clues and riddles.  use pictures as clues.  incorporate games into some of the clues.  use secret codes or invisible ink to make the clues a little more challenging.  hide the clues in something "gross" or fun to explore.  consider multi-part clues for older treasure hunters.  incorporate age-appropriate trivia, including popular characters and songs.  use a map instead of classic "clues." 

 Though the following steps will outline one procedure for making lotion, you can remove/add/substitute ingredients as you see fit. This version will use:          22 oz distilled water or aloe vera gel 1/2 tsp (pinch) cinnamon 1/2 tsp (pinch) citric acid 1/2 tsp potassium sorbate (if available) 1 tsp (5 g) each of selected herbs 1 teabag of your choice 5 oz scented oil 5 tbsps (75 g) emulsifying wax or shredded beeswax 1 tbsp (15 g) stearic acid 1 tsp (5 g) honey 1/8 teaspoon (dash) vitamin E oil or rosemary extract  , Once bubbling adequately, reduce the heat to medium. Add the cinnamon, citric acid and potassium sorbate (if you have it -- it's not imperative that you do).          Once dissolved, add 1 teaspoon (5 g) each of the herbs you picked and one teabag of your choice. After everything has simmered for 10 minutes on medium, reduce heat to low and continue simmering for another 30 minutes.  In a small pot or pan, add 5 oz of your chosen oil combined with 5 tablespoons (75 g) emulsifying wax or shredded beeswax (6 if you don't have stearic acid), 1 tablespoon (15 g) stearic acid (2 if you like it really thick), 1 teaspoon (5 g) honey and approximately 1/8 teaspoon vitamin E oil or rosemary extract.          Don't worry about mixing it yet; that'll come. You have more things to do right now!  , Alternatively, use the bottom of your double boiler. Strain the herb mixture into a large mixing bowl, squeezing all the good juice out of the herbs and teabag.          You'll be adding all the ingredients into this bowl, so make sure it can contain everything!  , Not a second more! The last thing you want is for it to overcook. Stir it often and don't let the oil get too hot -- that's the point of the double boiler. Remove from heat immediately when it reaches this point.          Though it may take time and feel like you're watching paint dry, keep an eye on this bowl. You'll want to be there to keep stirring and making sure nothing goes awry.  Be careful; this stuff can burn! It's fine to let the mixtures cool down a little, but they do have to be hot to mix. Blend on medium for two minutes.          This can be done in a blender, but it's possible your blender won't be the same afterward, so if you're attached to yours, don't use it.  Add up to 1 drop of essential or fragrance oil per two ounces of total mixture. Mixture will be watery until it cools and sets, so don't be alarmed if it seems runny.          Wait one or two hours before pouring mixture into the bottles. You don't want it too hot or it will melt the plastic and it will still have many air bubbles.

 Visiting your veterinarian regularly will help you stay attuned to any developing conditions. Very often, eye problems are indicative of larger underlying problems. Ultimately, routine physical examinations and bloodwork may make it so you can head off any eye problems.  Have your cat seen by a vet annually or semiannually. Notify your vet if you think your cat has allergies or other conditions, like runny eyes. Contact your vet immediately if you notice your cat has any eye problems.; , A somewhat common cause of eye problems in cats is injury inflicted by another pet. Whether it be friendly playing or a minor fight, your cat’s eyes could get scratched and become infected.  Supervise interactions between animals that don’t get along. Watch how new pets interact with other pets for the first days or weeks after you get them. Separate animals that may get into fights., Protecting your cat’s eye health involves maintaining proper nutrition. Without the right nutrition and vitamins, your cat’s eyes could suffer and be more susceptible to infection or other problems.  Make sure your cat consumes enough beta-carotene and vitamin A. Provide your cat with a food that is specially formulated for their lifestyle. For example, if your cat is an outdoor cat, make sure they eat food that provides them with the nutrition they’ll need to thrive outside. Change your cat’s food if you think it causes an allergic reaction that irritates their eyes., If you own a long-haired breed, you should trim their eye hair regularly. This is important, as eye hair accumulates debris and bacteria that could lead to an infection. To do this, take safety scissors and trim hair that is longer than an inch in length.  If you're uncomfortable trimming your cat's eye hair, consult a groomer or your veterinarian., Cats, like dogs and people, often have discharge from their eyes. This discharge could accumulate bacteria or get lodged in the eye at some point. Because of this, you should wipe your cat's eyes regularly with a warm wet rag.  Make sure the rag is clean and soft. You don't want to introduce bacteria or hurt your cat.  By cutting your cat's nails regularly, you'll decrease the chance that they accidentally scratch themselves in the eye. This is important, as scratches may lead to infections and serious eye problems.  When trimming your cat's nails, always make sure to cut above the quick (the fleshy part of the nail). Cutting the quick could cause your cat a lot of pain., There are variety of signs of discomfort that could indicate something is wrong with your cat’s eyes. If your cat shows any sign of discomfort or any sign that their eyes are bothering them, you should contact your vet.  Watch to see if your cat tries to scratch or rub their eyes. Look to see if your cat blinks a lot or acts as if something is lodged in their eyes., One of the most obvious signs of eye problems is a buildup of crust or other material around the eye. Most of the time, this indicates some sort of infection or related problem.  If you notice buildup, you should contact your vet immediately. The crust may appear green or yellow. In some cases, the buildup could be dark brown or black., If you see that your cat seems to have tears or watery discharge coming from their eyes, they could have a potentially serious eye problem.  These eye problems could be caused by infection or allergies.

You should contact your vet if your cat's eyes appear:  Red Cloudy Milky, If your cat has an infection, your vet will likely prescribe an antibiotic. You’ll be able to give your cat antibiotics as a pill, drops, or a topical cream. Without antibiotics, your cat may not be able to fight off the eye infection., In some cases, eye issues may be caused by a virus or fungus. If this is the case, your vet will prescribe an anti-viral or anti-fungal cream. The cream will fight the virus or fungus and help your cat’s eye to heal.  Your doctor may opt to prescribe anti-viral or anti-fungal drops instead of a cream., Elizabethan collars are cone-like devices that fit around your cat’s neck. They will prevent your cat from scratching their eyes.  If your cat has an infection, has had a surgical procedure, or has some other issue, you may need to fit them with an Elizabethan collar. Your cat will have to wear the collar until their eye recovers. You may be able to remove the collar while you supervise the cat. You can purchase a collar at a pet store or from your veterinarian. 

see your veterinarian regularly.  monitor your cat’s interactions with other pets.  maintain proper nutrition.  trim eye hair.  wipe your cat's eyes.  cut your cat's nails.  look for signs of discomfort.  watch for crust or buildup around the eye.  note tears or watery discharge.  observe changes in the appearance of your cat’s eyes.  apply antibiotics.  use anti-viral or anti-fungal cream.  use an elizabethan collar, if necessary. 

 Be extremely cautious when purchasing Nike shoes on the Internet. Since you don’t actually have the physical product in front of you, you can very easily be throwing money at a fake shoe. To avoid purchasing a fake:   Read website ratings and reviews before buying anything. Bad reviews is an obvious sign that the seller is not reliable or reputable. However, be careful because some sites will choose to only show “good” reviews. Do a third party search by inputting the seller in a third party search site and examining their reputation there instead of on the seller’s site. Ensure you are protected from fraud. Some online websites provide their customers with a return policy, even if the seller is a third party of the site. Having security that you will get your money back will protect you losing if you do happen to purchase fake Nike shoes.; , A stock shoe photo is more aesthetically appealing but it’s not what you should be looking for when purchasing shoes online. A photo that is obviously shot within a home ensures that the pair actually exists and its condition can be matched with the photo.   You could try to contact the seller and ask them to take another photo of the shoe with an item that determines the date or authenticity of the photo. For example, ask the seller to take a photo of the shoe next to today’s newspaper.  True Nike shoe samples only come in men's U.S. size 9, 10, 11, women's 7 and children's 3.5. There are also no such real Nike shoes that are “custom” or “variant”.   View the seller's entire inventory. For unknown reasons, counterfeiters tend not to sell U.S. sizes 9 or 13 and above. Older Nike shoes that are out of production are almost never available in a full sizing run. For example, if you're searching for a pair of vintage Nikes and find a site that has a stock of 200, they are likely fakes.  The shoe is either fake or extremely damaged.   Generally, a Nike shoe that is priced in half is most likely fake. A reasonable discount is more realistic, especially if the shoe is a limited edition or vintage. A seller might price it extremely high and offer you the chance to haggle to a ridiculously low price. Be careful, especially since you don’t have the physical shoe to verify its state and existence. Check the shipping estimation. If it will take between 7 and 14 days to deliver your shoes, they are likely traveling from China (a verified source of fake Nike shoes) or from another distant country. If you must order Nikes online, it's best to purchase them directly from the company's website or from the list of authorized , It is almost guaranteed that any shoe available before the official release date will be a counterfeit.   These shoes may look like an upcoming design but are most likely modelled very closely to look like it. Early release photos allow counterfeits to be produced without originals to be compared with and many people fall into the trap of attempting to get their hands on a pair before everyone else.  Once you find shoes you like, take more steps to verify their authenticity.   Double check with Nike or a trusted retailer's website to compare them with an image of the original shoe. Ask the seller to verify that the shoes are authentic. You can also ask for their supplier's contact information for further information.  

investigate nike shoes sellers on the internet.  avoid sellers that substitute stock shoe photos for pictures of actual nike shoes.  avoid items that claim to be "custom," "variant" or "sample" nike shoes.  avoid nike shoes priced far below their normal value.  don’t buy shoes that are available before the official release date.  verify your nike shoes. 

 You can find these in stores specializing in casting and mold-making supplies. You can also sometimes find these in a well-stocked arts and crafts store. Most kits will contain two containers labeled "Part A" and "Part B." Sometimes, you have to purchase them separately.  Do not mix the silicone yet.  Find a cheap, plastic food container made from thin plastic. Use a craft blade to cut out the bottom.Don't worry about how neat or jagged it is; this will eventually be the top of your mold.  Choose a container that is a little larger than the object you want to make a mold of.  Remove the lid from the container. Cut several long strips of packaging tape, and lay them across the top. Overlap strip by about ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters). Leave a couple inches/centimeters of tape hanging over all sides of the container.Run your finger along the rim to create a tight seal. Make sure that there are no gaps, or the silicone will pour out.  Once you fill the container with silicone, there is a small chance that some may leak out from under the tape. This will kept prevent the silicone from leaking out all the way and ruining your work surface., Place the container onto a flat, stable surface with the cut/open side facing up. Place your items into the box, and press them against the tape. Do not let the items touch the side of the container or each other. Also, make sure that the design portion of your item is facing up, and the back is pressed against the tape.Flat-backed items work the best for this. Wipe the items clean beforehand, if necessary.  You will always have mix Part A and Part B together. Some types of silicone are supposed to be measured by volume, while others need to be measured by weight. Read the instructions that came with your silicone closely, then measure them accordingly.  Pour the silicone into the cup included with your kit. If your kit did not come with a cup, pour the silicone into a plastic, disposable cup. You need enough silicone to cover your items by ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters).  You can do this with a skewer, a popsicle stick, or even a plastic fork, spoon, or knife. Keep stirring until the color is even, and no streaks or swirls remain., Use your stirring utensil to help scrape out any excess silicone so that you don't waste any. The silicone should cover the top of your item by at least ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters). If you make it too thin, the silicone mold may rip., How long this takes depends on the type brand you are using. Some brands are ready to use in a few hours, while others need to be left overnight. Refer to the instructions that came with your silicone kit for more specific curing times. Do not touch or move the mold during this time., Once the silicone has cured and turned rigid, peel the tape away from the box. Gently slide the silicone mold out. You may notice thin "feathers" if silicone around your mold. If these bug you, trim them off with a pair of scissors or a craft blade., The items you placed into the box will be stuck inside the silicone. Gently bend the silicone back to pop the items out. It is a little like remolding ice cubes from an ice cube tray., You can now fill the cavities with resin, clay, or even chocolate (if the silicone was food grade). If you used clay, you can pop the pieces out while the clay is still wet. If you used resin, however, you must allow the resin to cure completely before removing it. 

purchase a mold-making silicone kit.  cut the bottom out of a plastic food container.  place overlapping strips of tape over the top of the box.  fold the edges of the tape over the sides of the container.  set the item(s) you wish to mold into the container.  measure out your silicone according to the manufacturer's instructions.  stir the two parts until the color is consistent.  pour the silicone into the container.  let the silicone cure.  de-mold the silicone.  de-mold the items.  use the mold.

For most people, the recommended amount is six to eight 8-ounce glasses glasses of water every day. Talk to your doctor for a specific recommendation on how much water you should be drinking every day., Green tea has been shown to decrease the risk of uric acid-containing kidney stones. Try to drink about two to three cups of green tea per day to help lower your uric acid levels., Tart cherry juice has long been used in naturopathic medicine to treat gout and kidney stones.

 Soy, almond, coconut, and rice milk are fortified with certain nutrients to make the benefits comparable to milk.  If your child simply doesn’t like the taste of milk, they can get plenty of calcium and vitamin D from other dairy products.   Try using low-fat or fat-free individually-wrapped string cheese as a snack. Yogurt and even pudding will also work. Ice cream and frozen yogurt make great calcium-rich treats in moderation.  By making these nutrients part of every meal, you can make sure that your child is getting proper nutrition even if they don’t like milk.   Sometimes it can be tough to get picky eaters to eat foods that provide necessary nutrients. Sweet potato is usually a very kid-friendly food, and you may have more luck serving it to your child if they don't like broccoli or spinach.  Young children often take cues about what to eat or drink from their parents. Whatever you decide to serve your children, there is a greater likelihood that they will eat or drink it if you do so as well.  

try non-dairy varieties of milk.  use other forms of dairy.  serve vegetables that are high in calcium and vitamin d. milk’s nutrients are also present in broccoli, spinach, sweet potatoes, and bok choy.  set a good example. 

 It is advisable to take frequent 10 to 15 minute breaks while working, as this helps to reduce stress.   While on your break, you should take part in activities that help to alleviate stress, such as drinking a cup of tea or coffee, drawing, knitting, stretching and meditation.; , Practice aromatherapy while showering to help boost your spirits and relieve stress. This can be done by putting 3 to 4 drops of bergamot essential oil (or your preferred essential oil) on a sponge or cloth and placing it somewhere in the shower.   The steam that from the warm water helps to disperse the scent of the oil and when it reaches the nose, it will soothe you and balance your mood.  Menstruation can cause many bodily aches and pains, which leaves your body feeling tense and stressed.   Think about booking a reflexology appointment to help release some of this tension from the body and alleviate stress. You could also consider asking your partner to give you a foot rub or a back rub to relieve tension in these areas.  Use heat therapy to reduce abdominal cramps, as these can increase stress when one is menstruating.Use microwavable electric pads or hot water bottles that you can hold against your stomach or bring to bed with you.   There are also adhesive heating pads that are sold in pharmacies. These pads can be adhered to the back and the front of your underwear, providing warmth and comfort while you are busy running errands or at work.  Spoil yourself by listening to your body and doing whatever you feel like doing when you're on your period.   Try working from home instead of going to the office, going out for coffee or having some girl talk with a friend, opting for a gentle yoga class instead of your normal, hardcore training sessions. Not pushing yourself to do things you don't feel up to will help you to feel less stressed while menstruating.  

take frequent work breaks.  experiment with aromatherapy.  get a massage.  use heat therapy to relieve cramping.  listen to your body. 

 Before the race even starts, you should have an, "I will do well," mindset. If you don't think you will do well you won't do well.; , Once you can see the finish line, you should be running all out. Don't worry about coming up short. It's better to try to fail than to never try at all.  You can tell if someone's behind you by listening to their breathing and footsteps. Looking back will only slow you down. Instead, think, "this person isn't beating me," and run as fast as your legs will carry you.  Try to catch up to them anyway. While you may not win, it will improve your time and keep others from passing you. Have that same, "this person isn't beating me," mindset and run as fast as your legs will carry you.  The officials usually stop the clock as the runner's chest passes the finish line, not their legs, as it would be harder to tell who won in a close call. This could make the difference between 1st and 2nd place. (See the picture of the bunny.) Do this in races that don´t use time chips. When you are in a race that uses time chips thrust the foot that has the time chip first to lose some extra milliseconds. , If you have another event, go to that event.  If you felt like you had energy to do another lap at the end, you should have probably kicked sooner. But, if you are exhausted and feel pushed to your limit, you probably kicked at the right time. , 

motivate yourself to win.  focus on the finish line.  if you are in front, don't bother looking behind you.  if you are coming from behind, don't worry about how far behind you are.  right before you pass the finish line, bend down so your chest passes before your legs.  say "good job" and shake the hand of the person you were neck and neck with at the end of the race.  ,  make sure you get some water, cool down, and stretch.  evaluate yourself after the race.  good luck!  ,  get adrenaline for the last few meters and go all the way pretend that the finish line is a few meters back that way you sprint all the way to the end.  

 Just because your friend is a lesbian and you are female, don't assume that there is a romantic interest. Not everyone is going to be attracted to you, or vice versa. It's the same between men and women as it is between women and women. It's about romantic chemistry.   Avoid prejudice or biases towards your lesbian friend based on misconceptions.; , As with anyone who feels "butterflies in their stomach," your lesbian friend may give off signs that she is interested. Notice if the following signs are strong before assuming that your friend is into you:Physically touching you by hand or leg. Having strong eye contact, or gazing at you often. Smiling, laughing, and appearing to hang on your every word. Possibly being more physically shy or awkward than usual.  While some friends may have a close bond simply due to friendship, there are some signs that your friend may be attracted to you. Think of it like when you hang out with guys that you think might want to be more than "just friends."Does your friend seem to give pointed compliments to you often? Something like, "You're so beautiful" or "You have gorgeous eyes." Does she make a big effort to spend a lot time with you, even in group or large party situations? Do you feel like you communicate more with her than your other friends? Do you text or chat with her back and forth in the same way you do with guys you're interested in?  , You may like the attention you get from your lesbian friend, but at the same time you know you're not interested. Just like with guy friends, don't play head games and lead her on. If someone is attracted to you and you're not, be mature, polite, and respectful.Honesty in the beginning will help to avoid heartaches and drama in the future.  Unless your lesbian friend has already asked you out on a date, you may not know for sure what's going on her head. Talk with your friend to understand what her feelings are, and if it's true that she's into you.   If you have already engaged in sexual contact (such as kissing) or already gone on what you both know is a date, then your relationship has already gone outside "the friend zone." Be as kind and caring as you have been in the past with anyone you've dated.  Avoid discussing your relationship with your friend in public or in a group with other friends. This conversation should be between you and your friend only.   If you are planning to reject your friend's advances, avoid any embarrassment that may occur by talking in private. While you may be inclined to text or message your feelings about the situation, this may make things confusing or lead to misconceptions. Talk with your friend in person or at least over the phone. Direct private communication may be tough, but it will be better for both you and your friend.  When rejecting your friend, make clear that you are not rejecting your friend as a person. Be kind and gentle. Be clear that you simply are not interested in a relationship with her, and that you are not bisexual or lesbian.Be respectful of your friend's sexual orientation. Consider saying, "I respect your orientation, but I'm just not into you. I'm straight" or "You're a great friend, and hope to keep it that way, but I'm straight and just don't feel the same way."  , After rejecting someone (or being rejected), it can feel very awkward. Be mature and keep your head up. You may have rejected someone in the past, or been rejected. There is a transition phase that may feel weird, but you and your friend will move on and get over this feeling.Keep doing the things that you usually do, and avoid making this a big deal.  All friendships can go through ups and down. If you want to still be friends with your lesbian friend, make sure she still feels included in activities that you and your other friends are doing. Avoid excluding her due to this awkward feeling.   True friendships will remain even after difficult times. Make clear to your lesbian friend about what makes her such a great friend. Avoid compliments that have sexual connotations, but instead focus on her strengths as a friend. A good friend is caring, reliable, honest, and trustworthy.  Being gay or straight is part of human biology. Your lesbian friend did not "choose to be gay." A person's sexual feelings, whether gay or straight, are formed at or before puberty. Be respectful of your friend's sexual orientation.Talk with your friend about what challenges your friend may be facing with being a lesbian since society is often centered around heterosexual relationships. Understand her perspective.  It might be harder for your lesbian friend to talk about her sexuality because it is less accepted in many cultures. Be respectful that coming out and talking about sexuality can be very difficult for some people.Be gentle in how you react to your friend's actions or what she says about being lesbian. Avoid being overly critical.  Whether you have a lot of friends who are gay or not, being a real friend involves acceptance. While unwanted sexual contact shouldn't be taken lightly, feelings of awkwardness about someone's sexuality or your own biases should be avoided.   Your friend has a right to be who she is, and so do you. Allow your friends regardless of their sexual orientation the opportunity to express love. You may not reciprocate those feelings, but nonetheless they have a right to feel them.  

avoid assumptions.  look for body language.  listen to what your friend says and how she acts.  avoid leading someone on.  consider asking about her feelings toward you, if any.  talk with your friend in private.  turn her down gently.  avoid awkwardness.  keep your friendship strong.  view homosexuality as part of biology rather than a lifestyle choice.  understand that coming out as gay can be difficult.  accept your friends for who they are. 

 Use your hands to collect and lift your dry hair, and evenly apply a heat protectant spray.This will help reduce heat damage from the straightener.          Be sure that you don’t dampen your hair too much with the heat protectant spray. If you do, wait for your hair to naturally dry, or quickly blow dry your hair so you are working with dry hair.; , Use your fingers to separate your hair into 2-6 different sections. Try using the part down the middle of your head to section your hair into a right and left portion, and then section up each side into smaller sections.Do your best to make all the sections of hair the same thickness.          Keep in mind that the fewer braids you make (meaning more hair in each braid), the bigger your waves will be.The more braids you make (meaning less hair in each braid), the smaller and more crimped the waves will look.  Braid the sections of your hair using the normal three strand braiding technique. Once your braid comes within an inch or half inch from the bottom of your hair, use a thin hair tie to secure the bottom of the braid.          Where you start your braids depends on where you want the waves to start. If you want waves starting at the top of your head, make your braids as close to your scalp as possible. If you want the waves be start midway down your hair, start your braids down more, near your ears. Depending on the tightness of your braids, the end result will either be loose waves made with looser braids or tighter waves, made with tighter braids. Pull the braids apart to make them less cylindrical, and more flat. The flatness will help when moving the hair straightener along the braids., Clamp the flat iron onto one braid at a time. Start at the beginning of the braid, and hold the straightener in place for about three seconds.Open the clamped straightener, and move down the braid a little bit. Again, apply heat for about three seconds. Open and close the straightener as you move down, applying heat to the entire braid. You want to be sure that you can feel warmth on both sides of the braid. Apply heat to all of the braids.          Allow the braids to cool for about ten minutes after you have run the hair straightener over all of them. When the braids are cool, you can quickly run over the braids once more with the hair straightener, or finish up, and lightly mist the braids with a hairspray., Remove the hair ties at the bottom of each braid, and use your fingers to gently loosen and undo the braids. Don’t pull too hard, because you don’t want to mess up any of the waves. Rub the top of your head with your fingers to give your waves a more natural look and add volume your roots.         At this point, you can add a texturizing spray or hairspray to help the waves stay in place.  

apply a heat protectant.  section your hair.  braid your hair.  apply heat to the braids.  take out the braids. 

 Place bananas in a large bowl and place in the freezer. Freeze for a couple of hours until bananas are completely frozen.; , Cut a lemon in half and squeeze the juices into the food processor (make sure you don’t let any seeds fall in). Mix in 1 ½ cups of heavy cream into the food processor with the lemon juice. Mix in ¾ cup corn syrup. Add vanilla extract. Blend well with food processor until thick and creamy.  Break each banana in half, just so it is easier on the food processor. Place your frozen bananas into the food processor along with the cream you made from Step #2. Blend. Leave chunks if you like them, or make the whole mixture a smooth consistency.  Cover with foil. Place into freezer and freeze at 40 degrees.  Pour mixture into ice cream maker. Activate the ice cream maker.  To save your ice cream for later consumption, place finished product into container and place into freezer.  

peel all six bananas.  get out your food processor.  remove your frozen bananas from the freezer.  pour entire mixture into a freezer-safe container.  remove from the freezer.  enjoy! 

 Once you're within just a car's length or further away from the spot, you should switch into Reverse before you start backing up.  This will help you maintain control of your car as you back up.  This is a bit trickier when you're parking backwards, because you'll actually have to steer the wheel in the opposite direction that you want the car to go, instead of the same direction. If you want your car to move left, you'll have to steer to the right.  You can check your mirrors to start moving backwards -- or better yet, put your right arm around the left passenger seat, and look behind you. You'll have a better sense of where to move your car if you're actually looking at the space.  Once you've moved the car in the right space, press the brake firmly until the car comes to a complete stop. , 

shift to reverse (r).  apply light pressure to the brake.  steer your car in the direction of the spot.  pull into the spot.  press the brake firmly.  shift to park (p).  ,  set the parking brake in place.  

 You're going to be completing a pretty rigorous academic program for the next 15 years or so, so it's best to develop the work ethnic now. When you're used to studying and gettin' good at the book learning, you'll get less stressed out when med school rolls around.   And those good grades will get you into a better undergrad program which will, in turn, get you into a better medical school. Those good grades are what's going to get you an internship and a residency -- without them, the doors won't open for you.; , You may think going pre-med is your only option, but it's actually quite the opposite: some schools actually encourage you not to go pre-med. As long as you get the core requirements in, they suggest doing something you enjoy. Med school is bad enough; don't make it four years longer!It's a good idea to major in biology, chemistry, physics, or even English (it's a large part of the MCAT -- just make sure your electives are science-based). The more balanced out you are, the better you'll do in the future. If you go pre-med and change your mind (which loads of people do), you're up a creek without a paddle. That's why it's better to major in biology and the like.  If you live in the UK, take the UKCAT or BMAT. Taking this exam as early as possible will ensure that you have time to retake it if you don't do as well as you'd like. Different schools have different minimum scores for admission, so check with the schools you're considering to see if your MCAT score is high enough.   It's best to take the MCAT in your junior or early senior year. Be sure to study, study, study -- this score will determine what schools take you seriously when you apply.  Most medical schools like to see a solid background in life sciences and sturdy grades. Keep them as high as possible and try to get some experience in a research lab if you can. The more practical experience you have going in, the better. And you'll get an idea if this is indeed the path for you!   If you already graduated but didn't major in the sciences, there's still hope. Most people who've found their calling later in life just take a few classes post-baccalaureate to pad their transcripts and then apply. It is doable!  , These programs are competitive, so you may end up commuting or moving to another city to complete your doctorate. A Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree (D.O.) or Doctor of Medicine degree (M.D.) is required before you can move on to dermatology residency training. This program will take you about four years to finish.   The first two years will be spent in the classroom; the latter two years will be spent doing more hands-on training. You'll be working on clinical rotations, observing the pros and getting your feet wet. Finally!  , Med school is not for the faint of heart. If you can't handle not sleeping, a stressful course-load, and zero social life, it may not be the path for you. And rightfully so -- people's lives will be in your hands. Can you handle the heat?   You absolutely need to get good grades. Half-assing your way through won't cut it if you want this to be your profession. Unlike undergrad, you can't party away the night and fill in mostly Cs on your multiple choice exams and get by. This is stuff that needs to be taken very seriously.  For the med school student, June through August are not months to be drinking beer, watching baseball, and gearing up for September. You have to be permanently geared up. Take this time to take extra courses or get work. The more experience you have, the less you'll be phased in the long-run.   Heck, study abroad and help out in a grassroots medical program in a third world country. Volunteer. Do something related to what you want to do for the rest of your life. Get on a committee. Organize events. Find a mentor. Do something that sets you apart from the rest.  After around 3 years or so in med school, you'll be granted the opportunity to choose your electives -- or, in other words, what you want to focus on. It's in your fourth year (or the equivalent thereof) that you get to zero in on becoming a dermatologist.  That stands for the United States Medical Licensing Exam and Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination, respectively (so, obviously, if you're not in the U.S., don't worry about it) and each examination comes in three parts. Take this incredibly seriously as a good score is needed to obtain a residency. In fact, 1/3 of all applicants fail to get accepted into one.Step 1 is generally taken in the second year of your program; step 2 is taken during the fourth year, and the third step is taken during the first or second year of post-graduate training., In 1952, the NRMP (National Residency Matching Program) began. Luckily for you, placement rates are getting higher and higher.Think of it as going Greek. You interview with some hospitals and at the end of the day you both fill out who you want to work with. If you're both on each other's list, you got it! You want to be trained by them and they want to train you. Excellent.   You'll have a list of hospitals ranked in order of preference. You can include a combination of preliminary, transitional, categorical and advanced programs. So in the months prior (this is usually started in June or July), do your research and get to interviewing!  , Not all grads have to do a preliminary year, but dermatologists do. This is technically part of your residency, but it's viewed as just an internship (and can be done at a different hospital) and you'll be working in surgery or internal medicine (probably). But hey, you're out of school and on the right path! Super. Now it's time to prove that you've learned your stuff.   Some choose to take a transitional year (or TY). However, this is generally viewed as less academic (read: easier) and those that do it struggle when they get to their actual residency. Do a prelim year in pediatrics, general medicine, or whatever you could tolerate doing another year of! Getting an internship and residency is primo. Like mentioned above, plenty of people don't make it. If you don't have the stuff, it won't happen -- and it definitely won't fall into your lap. This needs to be a goal of yours from the get-go.  You may be able to continue at your current school but chances are you'll end up moving to another city and starting a new teaching program for your residency. In the United States, the school must be accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) or the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) and in Canada, it must have accreditation from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.   The American Board of Dermatology requires that a Preliminary Registration Form be completed by you within 30 days of starting your dermatology residency. In addition, your training director must fill out the Yearly Report Form on an annual basis to attest that you're completing the program properly. This is time well-spent learning from your mentors and finding your niche. You'll still be supervised as you're a newbie doctor, but you're a doctor nonetheless.  Though technically you're done at this juncture (apart from taking the last and final exam to get certified), some people decide to pursue a fellowship to establish a specialty. This is another spent devoted to working just in the one specific branch of dermatology that speaks to you.   You have a plethora of options -- everything from working with children to senior citizens, to skin cancer to removing tattoos. Your near decade of work in the area should give you a pretty good idea as to what you want to do!  , Passing this will give you your certification by the American Board of Dermatology or the American Osteopathic Board of Dermatology. You will then hold the title of board-certified dermatologist. Congratulations!   Check out the American Board of Dermatology's website for more information.They have links on test dates and procedures you'll need to know to complete your certification.  The regulations on licensure vary by state, so check with your local Department of Health for the requirements. After the application fee and assembling your qualifications, you should be good to go!   For now, that is. You'll need to retake (and pass) your boards every decade and take CME (continuing medical education) classes to stay up-to-date. It's all for the good will of your patients! Worth it.  Now that you're a licensed dermatologist, there are a number of work environments you could consider. It all depends on your specialty. Where do you see yourself working and with what types of people?   You could have your own private practice, or you could work in hospitals, spas, research labs, or clinics. And there's always teaching!  , Apart from being ridiculously driven to succeed, you need to be able to handle the human body in all its glory, too. You're going to see a lot of stuff you probably won't want to see, especially right after lunch.   Life is going to be full of rashes, skin aberrations, moles, blood, pus, and other unsightly things. If you don't have the stomach for it, this may not be a feasible career choice. If you don't know this going on, you'll soon find it out!  , Because of the human condition, loads of skin problems are just symptoms. It's not enough to know how the skin works -- you gotta know how the whole body works. Patients will come in with a skin rash that's actually due to problems in their digestive system. The problem might be in someone else's jurisdiction and you gotta know.   You also have to get a pretty good idea of what questions to ask. Each person's skin is different and their lifestyle, habits, and genes can all take their toll in different ways. Because of the wide variety of skin problems, you have to be able to pinpoint straight away the possible causes and narrow it down from there. Get good at questions now!  , According to the Bureau of Labor & Statistics, dermatologists are not hurting for cash. After a few years and if you're succeeding, you should be well making into the six figures and then some.The need for dermatologists is said to be on the rise. With more and more people becoming skin conscious, it seems as though this is a trend that will only continue. Not only will this job be incredibly financially rewarding, but it will be personally rewarding, too. You'll be helping loads of people be healthier and feel better about themselves. Now that's cool.  

focus on your grades during high school.  go to a four-year, reputable university for your undergrad.  take the medical college admission test (mcat).  earn your bachelor's degree.  apply to a medical program of your choice.  buckle down on your studies.  utilize your summers.  choose your specialty.  take the usmle and/or comlex.  get matched.  obtain a one-year internship.  start your three-year dermatology residency upon completing your internship.  pursue a fellowship.  sit for your board exam.  obtain your medical license.  obtain employment.  get good at not being grossed out.  know your stuff.  enjoy your piles of money. 

 Rinse your potatoes in cool or cold water to wash away any dirt. Scrub them gently with a soft sponge to clean them.  You may have to cut away some green or brown spots. Use a sharp knife or vegetable peeler to carefully slice away the blemishes.  If you plan to season the skins, dry potatoes are much better at absorbing seasonings.   Do not pierce the skins of the potatoes if you are not wrapping them. Piercing allows the moisture to escape, which will dry out the potato.  This will prevent the potatoes from sticking to the grill and create a crispier skin.   In a small bowl, mix cooking oil with a small amount of butter, salt, pepper, and garlic for a tasty seasoning spread.  Placing your potatoes on skewers makes the grilling process easier. Place 3 to 4 potatoes on each skewer depending on size.   You can also place your potatoes directly onto the grill if you prefer.  Using indirect heat, place the skewered potatoes on the edge furthest from the direct heat source.  Cook over the indirect heat for 30 to 40 minutes with the grill lid down. Gradually roll the potatoes toward the direct heat. 

wash the potatoes.  prepare each potato.  pat the potatoes dry.  brush the skins with oil.  place potatoes on metal skewers.  put your potatoes on the grill.  cook your potatoes. 

 Some studies indicate that a balanced, vitamin-rich diet that is low in processed carbohydrates, fats, and sugars can help promote a healthy complexion.Avoid crash or fad diets.Stay away from sugary drinks or junk foods. Instead look for foods that are rich in fiber, water content, protein, healthy fats, antioxidants, and vitamins. These foods are essential to overall health as well as skin health.Such foods include:   Almonds Avocadoes Berries Dark, leafy greens Fish Tomatoes Broccoli; , Dehydration can make your skin look and feel dry and saggy. Be sure that you drink at least 8 glasses of water each day. Steer clear of drinking too much alcohol or caffeine: these can dehydrate you and your skin., Sleeping on your side or stomach can lead to the development of lines and wrinkles over time. If you sleep on your back, you will avoid putting consistent pressure on your face, minimizing skin damage over the long term., Sun damage and sunburn is bad for your health and for your complexion. Always wear sunscreen, even if you are not planning on being outdoors for long. Look for an SPF 15 sunscreen or higher. Reapply as necessary throughout the day.Use at least 1 oz. of sunscreen, and don't forget your feet, hands, and ears. Take special care to apply sunscreen when you are near water or other substances that reflect the sun such as snow or sand.   If your skin is prone to acne or blemishes, look for a noncomedogenic (or non-oil based) sunscreen to minimize the clogging of your pores., The sun is at its strongest and most damaging between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Take care not to be exposed to the sun during these times. If you must be outside, make sure you are wearing sunscreen, protective clothing (such as a hat and sunglasses), and stick to the shade as much as possible., Beauty rest is not a myth: it is a fact.The more you sleep, the more your skin will be able to repair itself and look more youthful. Sleeplessness can cause your skin to appear patchy, baggy, or uneven in skin tone. Be sure that you get at least 8 hours of sleep each night to ensure that your skin looks youthful and rejuvenated.  It has been known for a long time that regular exercise can help improve overall appearance by increasing muscle tone, which makes your skin seem more elastic and youthful. However, recent studies show that exercise might also make your skin healthier and younger.Exercise also increases blood flow to your skin, which helps nutrients reach your skin cells. Be sure that you engage in at least 20 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity at least 3 times per week. Try running, biking, or swimming.   If you choose to exercise outdoors, be sure that you are protecting your skin from the sun.Wear athletic clothing that wicks moisture to prevent skin irritation, rashes, or blemishes.Wash your athletic clothing and towels after each use to prevent skin conditions common to athletes such as athlete's foot, fungus, or infection., Smoking makes your skin less elastic, leading to more wrinkles. Smoking also harms your blood vessels, meaning your skin is deprived of key nutrients it needs to repair itself. Many smokers also get unsightly wrinkles around their mouths from where they purse their lips. Quit smoking in order to allow your skin to repair itself, and to encourage your complexion to be as youthful and healthy as possible., Stress can lead to acne breakouts, sleeplessness, and other skin-damaging behaviors. Minimize stress in your life in order the minimize stress on your complexion.Try deep breathing techniques, meditation, or visualization exercises to keep yourself calm. Exercise is another great way to keep yourself relaxed.  Wash your face every morning and every evening before bed to keep your skin clean and healthy. You should also wash your face after exercise or excessive sweating. Do not wash your face more than that, since that can strip your face of key oils and damage healthy skin cells.Be sure that you use warm or lukewarm water when you wash: hot water can dry out and damage your skin.Only use your hands and fingers to wash: do not use scratchy cloths, loofahs, or sponges.If you wear makeup, it is essential that you remove all products before bed. Leaving makeup on overnight can clog your pores and encourage the spread of unhealthy bacteria on your face., Harsh cleansers and perfumes might dry out your skin. These products are also more likely to irritate sensitive skins.Avoid products with alcohol in them, since that is a drying agent. And if you have oily skin, look for products that are noncomedogenic (or water-based instead of oil-based). Look for unscented products that are suitable for sensitive skins.  Do not rub your skin after washing. Patting or blotting yourself dry will help keep your skin moisturized and healthy. Use soft towels--not harsh or scratchy cloths--to dry yourself., It might seem counterintuitive, but moisturizing is necessary in order to prevent skin blemishes and conditions. When your skin is too dry, it actually increases your skin's oil production. By keeping your skin properly moisturized, you avoid the overproduction of oils that cause blemishes.A moisturizer can also help minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, though a moisturizer cannot prevent these lines from occurring.Look for a noncomedogenic moisturizer if you are prone to oily skin.By purchasing a moisturizer with SPF 15 or higher, you can kill two birds with one stone.Moisturizer is most effective when used on damp skin, fresh from washing or showering., Many skin types benefit from exfoliating creams and scrubs. When you exfoliate, you are removing dead skin cells that clog pores and cause blemishes. Exfoliating can make your skin look and feel softer, younger, and healthier.However, exfoliating can also be harsh on those with sensitive or dry skin, and exfoliation is harmful to those with acne. Talk to your doctor or dermatologist to determine whether exfoliation might help or harm your skin.Other conditions that can be exacerbated by exfoliation include rosacea and eczema. If you have these conditions, talk to a dermatologist about your skin care options.  Facial scrubs that exfoliate often have microbeads or small pieces of fruit pit or nut shell that can reach into your pores to clear out dead skin cells and oils. There are different kinds of exfoliating scrub for different skin types.In general, scrubs made with plastic microbeads are better for those with sensitive or dry skin. Scrubs made with fruit pit or nut shell are better for those with very oily skin that is not sensitive.Most people are better off using exfoliating scrubs that have a low acid concentration. Read the labels of all the products you buy, and ensure that the concentration of salicylic acid are lower than 2% and that the concentration of glycolic acid is less than 10%., Using warm--not hot--water, gently wet your face. Then apply the exfoliating scrub with your fingers and gently rub your skin for 60 seconds or so. Then rinse your face completely. Resist the temptation to over-scrub or to leave the scrub on your skin for more than a minute or so: a gentle touch is necessary to get the maximum benefit from an exfoliating scrub.  Regular exfoliation will keep your dead skin cells from mixing with oil and dirt and clogging your pores.However, over-scrubbing and exfoliating too often can dry out and harm your skin, leading to even more blemishes and clogged pores. Be sure that you limit your exfoliation to just 1-2 times per week to ensure that you benefit from exfoliation without harming your complexion., Many anti-aging treatments can work to minimize the appearance of wrinkles or age spots. However, there is no miracle cure for aging, and most anti-aging treatments are only temporary, cosmetic fixes.Still, if you wish to have skin that looks more youthful, there are many products and treatments on the market that may give you a fresher, less wrinkled appearance., Because anti-aging creams are considered to be cosmetics and not medicine, they have not been as thoroughly tested as most prescription products. However, there are certain ingredients that can promote a more youthful complexion.Be on the lookout for products that contain:Retinol Vitamin C Niacinamide Coenzyme Q10 Hydroxy Acids Anti-inflammatories such as tea extracts and grape seed extract  , Many anti-aging treatments include petroleum jelly or sulfates. While these ingredients might have a small effect on the appearance of wrinkles, they also can lead to blemishes or dried-out skin. Avoid these ingredients if you want to benefit fully from an anti-aging cream., Do not pick at them.Picking at a pimple can lead to infection, scarring, or the spread of pimple-causing bacteria.If you want a beautiful complexion, you have to be willing to let your pimples clear up over time.  Using warm water and a gentle cleanser, wash any acne-prone areas every morning and evening.Resist the urge to use hot water or to scrub harshly: a gentle touch is needed in order to see an improvement.   Shampooing every day or keeping your hair tied back can also help reduce the amount of oil that spreads from your hair to your face., Certain environments and professions that involve exposure to grease might exacerbate blemishes. If you are worried about blemishes or have blemish-prone skin, you might want to steer clear of jobs where you would work with grease, such as working in fast food., Items such as hats, stuffy clothing, headbands, and phones can make your skin produce more oil and can also spread acne-causing bacteria.Try to keep any blemish-prone skin areas clear of objects that might spread oil and bacteria. Wear breathable, loose fabrics to help avoid clogged pores on your body.  It might be tempting to exfoliate skin that is particularly prone to blemishes. However, you must resist the urge to use harsh exfoliating treatments on this delicate skin. You risk damaging your skin, and exfoliating treatments will not improve the acne.  These are the most common ingredients in over-the-counter anti-acne topical treatments.They will help reduce the amount of oil on your skin and will help prevent acne outbreaks. Follow the instructions carefully, and be on the lookout for possible allergic reactions to these products. However, it is normal to experience some initial redness or peeling in the first month of use.   Be aware that many over-the-counter topical treatments will make your skin even more susceptible to UV damage from the sun. Take especial care while using these medications that you use sunscreens and wear UV protective clothing., A dermatologist is a doctor who specializes in the skin. If home remedies and over-the-counter treatments are not improving your skin condition after a month or two, a dermatologist might be able to provide some specialized advice on how to deal with blemishes properly.  Your dermatologist might recommend that you use stronger topical treatments than are available over-the-counter. Many of these prescription products to treat acne include retinoids (which prevent your pores from clogging), antibiotics (which kill blemish-causing bacteria on the skin), and oil-clearing agents.Be sure that you follow your doctor's instructions carefully, since some of these medications might cause side effects or allergic reactions.  There are other prescription medications available that can help prevent pimples. Many women report that oral antibiotics improve the quality of their skin. Oral antibiotics are another option to help keep the skin clear of acne-causing bacteria. In very severe cases, your dermatologist might also recommend harsher oral medications such as anti-androgen agents or isotretinoin--however, these medicines have much more severe side effects and should not be used casually., If you are still experiencing unwanted blemishes after making lifestyle adjustments and using a variety of topical and oral treatments, there are a few other kinds of therapies that might help improve your complexion. Talk to your dermatologist about whether these might be a good fit for you. They often have side effects, and they might be more costly than other options. They also require a significant time investment, since most therapies must be done in the doctor's office.Such therapies include:   Light therapy Chemical peels Steroid injections Extraction of blemishes  ,

 Use homemade bread, if possible, such as white bread, braided challah bread, or French bread. Slice the bread into six slices, about 1.5 in (3.8 cm) thick. Use a paring knife to cut a horizontal pocket into each slice of bread, taking care not to cut completely through the slice., Use homemade jam, if possible. Mix the jam and softened cream cheese together. Spoon the mixture into a piping bag or a sealable plastic bag.Use any jam or marmalade you like, such as blueberry, orange, or mixed berry.  Snip off a bottom corner of your sealable bag, if applicable. Squeeze the piping bag to fill the pocket of one slice of bread. Press down around the edges of the bread to secure the sandwich.Use about 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of filling for each sandwich. Repeat this process for each sandwich.  In a bowl, whisk together a batter of eggs, milk, cinnamon, and vanilla, if desired. Coat the bread on both sides., Place the butter in a large skillet or griddle over medium-low heat. Cook one side of the pocket until it is golden brown, then flip the bread with a spatula and cook the other side equally., You can top the pockets with sprinkled powder sugar, warmed-up jam, or syrup. Try adding a side, like breakfast meat or fresh fruit. 

select and slice bread.  combine the filling ingredients in a sealable bag or piping bag.  stuff the bread with filling.  dip the bread in the egg mixture.  cook each pocket for about four minutes on each side.  dress and serve the bread. 

 Many websites allow you to track not only your weight, but the calories in your food, your mood, your exercise and eating habits.

Popular options include My Fitness App, Locavore, and Endomondo., The advantage to on-line websites and apps is that they can track multiple aspects of your weight loss, not just the pounds that you lose or gain. You are more likely to hold yourself accountable if you have just one place where you can keep all of your information.  

find an online website where you can track your progress.  use a weight loss app on your mobile phone.  streamline your needs. 

 Children retain information better when their hands and their brains are simultaneously busy, or engaged. This is accomplished by developing lessons and activities that require students to talk, listen, and move. These types of lessons and activities will benefit active, auditory, and visual learners.   Incorporate more arts and craft projects into your lessons. Have students move around to different learning stations. Group students by interests or strengths. Provide them with activities that let them explore a topic in a way that engages them., Field trips provide students with the opportunity to connect the abstract concepts they are learning inside the classroom to the real world.   As an educator, select field trips that promote hands-on learning. For example, if you are studying your nation’s government, take them to your state’s capitol building. As a parent, you have the luxury to use your time and resources a little more creatively. Take your child to an art museum out of state to see their favorite painting or to a distant historic site to experience your nation’s history. Sign your child up for an engineering camp or have them shadow one of your friends at an office., Instead of limiting or checking their imagination, allow their creativity to run rampant. Foster their creativity by designing lessons that encourage the use of arts and crafts, role playing, or a range of similar activities.   When teaching students about the judicial branch, have your students hold a mock-trial. When younger students study historical figures, ask them to dress up as their subject for a formal presentation. Provide your children with the freedom to express themselves through a variety of forms. Older kids may enjoy writing poetry, telling stories, penning a play, or creating collages.

 Already have a vision of what you want your makeup to look like that amazing day––it's time to amass a few ideas so that you can narrow it down to a few choices. Look through books, magazines, and even in the hairdressing salon's books for makeup ideas.  Bridal magazines have great pictures or the Internet and sites such as Pinterest are useful.; , Tear or print pictures out, and make a folder.  Don't assume anything if you're not expert with makeup. Sometimes what you think is natural makeup maybe not be as natural makeup to other, so is good to bring pictures and have the makeup explained to you.  Visit the stores that carry the lines you like best. Ask whether the store has makeup artists; if so, ask to take a look at some of the makeup artist's portfolio. Do you like the portfolio makeup? If so, that's a good start., If you like the convenience of having someone come to you directly on your wedding day then seek out makeup artists that are freelance and mobile in your area.  If this is a requirement for you, then conduct a web search for makeup artists and hair stylists in your area.

If you're having your wedding planned by a wedding planner, ask if they have any makeup artist suggestions, because they should have at least one.  Look at their portfolio of work and decide if their style of makeup is similar to your own. When looking over the images, check for things such as skin tone matching, attention to detail and if they include any current bridal makeup trend pictures in their portfolio of work. The portfolio is everything, and don't try to ignore what you don't like.  Contact them and ask around or visit, as required.  A top makeup artist should demonstrate an open and friendly manner on the phone. Be sure you have a calm and confident feeling when you’re speaking with them. If they exude a calm and natural manner over the phone they will likely be this way in person and will keep you calm on your wedding day  , Be specific on how you would like to look on your big day. Use your collected clippings from magazines, etc., to show the makeup artist what your preferred style is. Check that they listen to what you really want. If you aren't that sure, ask if your makeup can be done in front of a mirror, or if you can have a break every minute or so. Check in the mirror when doing this.  Once your makeup trial is complete, the makeup artist should ask you if you’re happy with the results. If you are not, they should re-do the look until you are satisfied., Ask the artist what kind of fee do they charge. Find out what availability they have. Check that they'll use the makeup brands you like (or have to use if you have specific issues such as allergies)., A good makeup artist will often be booked months in advance. If you are not happy with your results, go back to your list and start over.  

decide what makeup style you want before looking for the makeup artist.  make a scrapbook of ideas.  take a stroll to the mall to browse through the kinds of makeup you like the most.  decide whether you wish to have your bridal makeup done in your home/venue or if you want to go to a salon/mall on your wedding day.  decide whether you want both your wedding day makeup and hair arranged at the same location.  ask around and get referrals.  review several makeup artist websites from your chosen area.  create a list or bookmark your favourite bridal makeup artists, including the ones who have been recommended.  know what to look for.  make an appointment for a bride makeup trial with your favorite makeup artist.  notice their willingness to keep trying until you're satisfied.  find out some other basics.  book them immediately if you’re happy with your results. 

 Munchkin cats have a lot of energy. They are very fast, and often can be seen running around their house. They love to chase anything from mice to toys. Though they have short legs, that doesn’t stop them from jumping and climbing, even if it takes them longer.They often stand on their hind legs to investigate their surroundings.  This breed is very social, so expect the cat to be outgoing and friendly with people and other pets. They often wrestle and play with other cats and cat-friendly dogs. They love attention from their owners, and love to curl up in your lap.This breed is great with children.  One unique characteristic of this breed is their tendency to steal shiny objects and hide them. They also will take their favorite toys and place them somewhere they can find them later. Don’t be surprised if you find this cat borrowing some of your shiny belongings.Because of this, Munchkin cats have been described as the magpies of the cat species. Try to put away any objects that the cat may try to steal or chew on. If these small objects are swallowed, the cat may choke. Some small objects, such as button batteries, can kill the cat if swallowed.  

look for a fast, agile cat.  expect a loving, affectionate pet.  be aware of their love for shiny objects.

 Does the attention she gives you constantly vary? Does talk about how she is attracted to other people constantly? Those might be signs that she isn’t that serious about the relationship. However, sometimes her behavior may just reflect how comfortable she is in public. For example, if she’s way more emotionally available and affectionate when you’re hanging out alone it might just mean she’s shy around other people. Don’t be suspicious of that. Merely talking about other guys is not necessarily a bad sign. She may just have guys in her life who she's close to. However, if she routinely talks about how attracted she is to another guy (not you), she may not be into you.  Does she deny being in a relationship with you to other people, even her closest friends? If she denies dating you when talking to her friends she might be acting in a manipulative manner.   People sometimes like to keep their new love interests out of the spotlight in the event that you have no interest in them. However, once you're dating and everything is exclusive, there is no reason she should be worried to discuss you with her friends.  You should feel emotionally and physically comfortable in the relationship. If you feel like you have to walk on egg shells around her or that you are always waiting for the next explosion, you may be in an unhealthy relationship. This is really a gut feeling, but you probably already know the answer.  In a healthy relationship, your partner should do their part to try to interact civilly with the important people in your life. If they are constantly putting down your friends and family they may be trying to isolate you from the people who matter to you. Whether they are doing this consciously or subconsciously, it is still manipulative and unhealthy. , If you’re being paranoid, your friends might be able to get you to stop worrying so much and tell you that you’re being crazy. If there’s fire behind the smoke, they’ll be honest with you. A lot of the time friends want to be supportive of their friend’s relationships even if they know something is wrong. You might have friends who were waiting to tell you that this girl was playing games with you. They were just waiting for you to ask because they didn’t want to offend you. 

consider how invested she seems in you.  pay attention to how she talks about the relationship.  assess whether or not you feel safe in the relationship.  notice how she interacts with your friends and family.  ask your friends for advice.

 If you wear contacts or glasses, pack supplies for these items. You should have contact lens solution, a contact case, and a few spare contacts if you wear contacts. If you wear glasses, keep glasses cleaner on hand as well as microfiber lens wipers.It's a good idea to have anti-bacterial hand gel on hand so you can use this to sanitize your hands if you need to change your contacts when you're not near a sink.  If you like to smell nice, a small bottle of perfume, body spray, or deodorant can be great. You can use these products to freshen up between classes. It's a good idea to keep your perfume in a Ziploc bag. This will minimize damage in the event your perfume leaks.You can buy travel sized containers of perfume and body spray at department stores. These may fit better in a high school survival kit.  If you have your period at school, you want to be prepared. Always have tampons, pads, or panty liners packed in your survival kit.In the event of a leak, it's a good idea to have a spare pair of underwear. You can roll up your underwear and keep them in a discrete pocket of your survival kit or somewhere in your backpack. You also may want to carry painkillers if you end up with menstrual cramps at school.  You may need hair ties for gym class. You may also simply want to redo your hair during lunch or between classes. Pack a hairbrush in your survival kit, as well as a few hair ties., If you wear makeup, you may need to touch it up at some point during school. Keep makeup in a small, sealable container and put this in your survival kit.You should also pack any brushes or other instruments you use to apply makeup. Make sure to close containers of things like lipstick, lipgloss, and foundation carefully. You do not want such items to spill in your kit. If your lips get dry, add chapstick as well. Add a compact mirror as well as you can use that while touching up your makeup.  You never know when you may want to freshen up your breath or touch up your hair. Buy travel-sized versions of toiletries you commonly use. For example, have some travel sized dry shampoo, leave-in conditioner, mouth wash, and toothpaste. You can also add a small tooth brush to your kit.  

pack eye care supplies if you need them.  add deodorant or perfume.  make sure to include feminine products.  remember hair ties and hair brushes.  pack any makeup you use.  bring travel-sized products. 

 Find a fabric that you love that will also be comfortable to wear and easy to sew. Before buying elastic, measure around your waist where you want your skirt to sit. This is how long your piece of elastic should be. You will also need a measuring tape and washable marker, a pair of sharp scissors, a needle, thread, and pins.; , You can buy a simple skirt pattern either online or at a fabric/craft store. It might be easier to buy one at a store, because online patterns are often too large to print on a normal printer.   Many patterns also come with suggestions for the types of fabric and thread that would work for the project, so it’s a good idea to buy the pattern and check those out first before buying your other materials.  Lay your printed pattern over your fabric and pin the two together. Then cut carefully around the edge of the pattern. Depending on the pattern you buy, you will likely have two matching pieces when you’re done: one for the front of the skirt and one for the back.  Sew the front and back pieces together on the right and left edges. Make sure the “right” side of each piece (the side of the fabric you want showing on your skirt) is facing in, against the other. Sew evenly along the edges with a simple stitch.          This is a good point to carefully try on the skirt (you can keep it inside out). If it needs to be smaller at any point, take it in by stitching parallel to the inside of your previous line of stitching.  Fold over a half inch of the fabric at the bottom of the skirt and sew the hem using a hemming stitch.  If you buy a pattern with an elastic waist or room for a zipper, you will need to sew that next. Place your piece of elastic at the inside top edge of your skirt and stitch the two ends of the elastic together. Then fold that top edge of the fabric down, so that the elastic is encased in fabric. Sew this “casing” around the elastic by stitching the fold to the main skirt, much as you did with the hem. 

gather your materials.  find a sewing pattern.  cut your fabric to the pattern.  sew the pieces together.  make the hem.  make an elastic or zipper top. 

 Make the knot as tightly as possible.; ,, Divide the strings into pairs (paper clips, or clothes pins, will be used to keep pairs together temporarily, until tied). Make a knot by tying each pair of strings together at your marks. Take the original paper clip off before you tie each pair.  Take two knotted pairs right next to each other, and choose one string from the pair of knots, and paper clip the pair of chosen strings together, for getting them paired correctly. Before tying the row of knots, check the pairs and the net. If any string is across any of the space inside the net, meant for the hay, then you've paper clipped strings together that aren't next to each other, or tangled them. To fix that, you probably need to start again and pair them. Tie knots where you have marked them. Do the same for the other pairs going around; so, now each pair is "holding hands" with the two pairs on either side of it. Spread the net -- and you should be able to see diamond shapes.  Remember to check the net, as you have it clipped together, before you start tying each row of knots.  Instead of tying a standard knot, tie a quick-release knot (the same as when you tie up your horse) you will then have a loop. Secure this by tying a double knot with the loose ends. Trim the ends, if you need to and then burn/melt the ends to stop their fraying (using a cigarette lighter), but have water on hand! (Don't forget to melt ends of strings from the big knot at the bottom of the net.)  , (This can also be made from bailing twine by plaiting three pieces together)  , You can (very carefully) melt each knot somewhat, to prevent knots from loosening, with water available for any fire emergency. Fill it with hay and hang it securely.  

tie the ends of 10 lengths together (or more for a bigger net, but make it an even number) of 7 feet (2.1 m) long strings.  you should ask someone to hold the net up by the knot or nail the knot up or you'll get very confused and the string will get very tangled.  ,  measure 4 inches (10.2 cm) down (or less for a smaller-holed net) and mark with a felt-tip pen.  mark 4 inches (10.2 cm) down again from the row of knots that you just tied.  mark, pair, tie and continue this for each row.  make sure you have 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) of string left after your last mark, when you get to your last row.  thread a strong plastic drawstring through the loops.  finished. 

 Get the yellow fever vaccine if you live in, or are travelling to, the parts of South America or Africa where yellow fever is present. The vaccine is approved for people over 9 months old. Get the vaccine at specific centers that provide it, which you can find through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) yellow fever clinic finder website.   Some countries require that you get the vaccine or a booster dose in order to travel there. If you’ll be travelling, check the CDC’s travel page.Ask your doctor whether it’s safe for you to get the vaccine if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, over 60 years old, or have HIV without symptoms.Do NOT get the vaccine if you’re allergic to any part of it, have symptomatic HIV or other immune system disorders, have cancer, or are taking immunosuppressant drugs or recently had a transplant.  Avoid mosquito bites to prevent transmission of yellow fever. Any time you are outdoors in an area that has yellow fever, wear EPA-registered (Environmental Protection Agency) insect repellent on any uncovered skin.Reapply the repellent if you start to get mosquito bites. Apply it as directed on the container.   Use repellent that contains DEET, picaridin, IR3535, or oil of lemon eucalyptus for best protection. Don’t put repellent over cuts or wounds, or into your eyes. Wash off repellent with soapy water when you go indoors.It’s safe to use insect repellent on children. However, do not use oil of lemon eucalyptus on children under 3 years old.  Wear long-sleeved shirts, pants, and socks when outdoors. Spray insect repellent that contains permethrin over your clothes to deter mosquitoes from biting through the fabric. You can also purchase clothing that is pretreated with permethrin – a repellent you can use over clothes but not directly on your skin., Though many mosquitoes are most active from dusk to dawn, one type of mosquito that transmits yellow fever is also active during the day. Protect yourself around the clock by wearing repellent and appropriate clothing any time you’re outdoors. When possible, sleep in an air-conditioned room with closed or screened windows, or under a mosquito net. 

get vaccinated.  use insect repellent.  wear protective clothing.  protect yourself throughout the day and night. 

 Though it may be difficult to handle complaints from friends and family all the time, you should try to be a good listener and support those close to you. This means not interrupting the person when they are speaking and not talking over them. You should also focus your attention on them when they are speaking and maintain eye contact with them.Try to also practice active listening, where you listen closely to what the person is saying and then repeat what they said to you back to them. You may say, “What I hear you saying is…” or “I think you are upset because…” Once they have agreed that you have heard what they said correctly, you can respond to them in kind. For example, maybe your sister is complaining about her boyfriend. Once she has finished speaking, you may say, "What I hear you saying is that you don't like it when Darren stays out all night without calling you or checking in." Your sister should agree that you heard her correctly and you can then respond to her complaint.  Approaching someone who complains with empathy and compassion will allow the person to feel supported and acknowledged. Simply acknowledging the feelings and concerns of the person complaining can really make them feel that they are being heard and that you care.Show empathy for the person by listening to what they have to say and then stating: “I hear what you’re saying”, or “I can understand why you might be upset.” The act of showing empathy can also help the person to reflect on their own perspective and attitude. You may say, “I can see why that might be difficult” and the person may take a moment to consider if in fact the issue is really that difficult or dramatic. Taking a moment to consider the reality of the situation may allow the person to put their complaints in perspective and not feel as bad about the situation. Avoid being sarcastic or mocking of the person complaining, even if you feel their complaints may not be justified. Doing this will only make the person feel worse and could lead to a conflict with them. Instead, try to be compassionate and empathetic to the person as much as you can.  Once you have listened to the person’s complaint, you should try to offer solutions or advice to help them feel better about the situation. You may suggest that they approach the issue in a certain way or share your own experience in a similar situation.However, it's always nice to ask first. Not only does it confirm whether or not the person really wants advice or not, but also helps the person receiving the advice to remain open and receptive to it. For example, you may say, "I think you may be missing the positives of the situation" or "Have you considered the upsides of the issue?" You may also make suggestions on how the person can deal with the issue, such as, "Maybe you could try talking to someone with authority about the issue" or "Have you considered letting go of the issue and moving on?" Keep in mind that though you may offer the person advice or a solution, they may not take it and that is okay. Sometimes, a person is so wrapped up in their situation that they may not be willing or able to take someone else’s advice. You should try to be supportive of the person, even if they do not take you up on your solution.  Though you should try to listen and support those around you who have complaints, you should also set firm clear limits for yourself. Setting limits around how long you can listen to the person complain and how often you can be the “voice of advice” for them will ensure you do not take on too much of their situation. You may limit the amount of time you set aside to spend with the person or put boundaries around how long you will listen to the person complain.For example, perhaps you have a family member who often complains about the same issues at her work. You may listen patiently to her talk about the issues for ten minutes at the dinner table and then introduce other topics of conversation. Share what’s going on in your life or ask the family member about a more positive aspect of her life. Setting limits will also allow you to be a good listener and support in the future, as listening to too much complaining all the time can lead to resentment and frustration. You should be clear about your boundaries so you do not end up having to always be the one who listens to the person’s complaints.  

be a good listener.  show empathy and compassion.  offer possible solutions and advice.  set clear limits and boundaries. 

 To do so, either click the Windows logo in the bottom-left corner of the screen, or press the ⊞ Win key.   On Windows 8, you'll instead hover your mouse in the top-right corner of the screen, then click the magnifying glass icon.; , This will bring up the Command Prompt icon at the top of the Start window.  It's a black box at the top of the Start window. Doing so invokes a drop-down menu.   If you're on a computer that doesn't have right/left mouse buttons, tap the trackpad with two fingers instead.  It's at the top of the drop-down menu.   You can't change your computer's time and date without administrator privileges.  Command Prompt will open with your cursor ready to type.  Be sure to leave a space after the word "time", since the time-stamp must be separate from the command.  For example:    5:30 PM would be written as time 05:30:00 PM   3:30 and 30 seconds AM would be written as time 03:30:30 AM.  The clock is in the bottom-right corner of your computer's taskbar. You should see the time change almost immediately.  Again, leave a space after "date" for the time-stamp.  For example:    January 7th, 2003 would be written as date 01/07/2003.  December 14th, 2017 would be written as date 12/14/2017.  The date is directly beneath the time in the bottom-right corner of the screen. It should reflect the date you just entered.

 Often, during the process of making folds, you crease the page, make the wing length uneven, and so on. Unfold your plane and refold it again. If there’s an extra crease on one side, add it to the other. That way, the wind will hit the plane the same way on both sides.You can also cut off uneven and excess bits of paper, but this is risky since you won’t be able to go back.; , The aspect ratio of the wings affect flight. Long, wide wings are good for gliding but have to be thrown gently. Short, stubby wings are usually better because you can throw the plane faster and angle it more upwards. Refold the wings according to your needs., A standard airplane needs wings that point upwards. If your wings are flat or upside down, redo them. Wings angled upwards are called “dihedral” and give your plane lift. Lift the wings upwards so that the wing tips are above the rest of the plane., Fins are small folds you make on the wings. The paper doubles over itself when you do this. Take the edges of the wings and fold them downwards and over. This is the fin, and the fold should be parallel to the length of the plane. These fins can help stabilize and strengthen some planes.Fins are useful in more complicated designs. For standard dart planes, they should be avoided since they will slow the plane.  Stable paper airplanes fly farther and faster. Paper airplanes typically benefit from adding what’s known as up elevator. Take the back end of the airplane, which on a standard dart-shaped plane is the wing tips, and use your finger to bend them upwards a little.This counterbalances the weight in the nose of your plane.  Most planes also benefit from a little weight in the nose. This helps balance the plane so it doesn’t have a tendency to fly straight up. Cover the nose in a layer or two of tape or add a paper clip. Test out out the plane and make adjustments as necessary.Heavier planes are better at withstanding outdoor flight.  Bending the wing tips downwards is only useful for planes that try to fly upwards when launched. Use your fingers to bend them down slightly. Try throwing the plane again. If this isn’t enough to balance it, you can try adding more weight to the nose of the plane.  Slightly bend the end of the tail to the left. If your tail has two sides, bend the left side up and the right side down. When the air hits the bends, the plane will change the plane’s direction., If your plane has a single, vertical edge for a tail, bend it to the right. Otherwise, pull the right side up and the left side down. These bends will correct the airflow to cause a more stable flight.  The fuselage is the bottom part of the plane. In most paper airplanes, this is where the fold separates the two sides. You’ve worked to balance your plane, so grip the center of the fuselage with your fingertips. This is where the plane gets a lot of its stability.  More delicate planes are better gliders. A rough launch will damage them and ruin their flight trajectory. Bring your wrist forward in a pushing motion. Keep the plane level with the ground., Planes with short wings function better with a hard launch. Angle your plane upwards. Use the same pushing motion with your hand, but apply more force. If the plane is a dart, it will stabilize as it descends.Non-dart glider planes should be throw upwards gently with a pushing motion.  

make sure the wings are symmetrical.  make the wings shorter.  angle the wings.  add fins to complicated designs.  bend the back end of nosediving planes upwards.  weigh down the nose on stalling planes.  bend the back ends downwards on stalling planes.  bend right-leaning planes to the left.  bend left-leaning planes to the right.  hold the fuselage.  throw thin, long-winged planes gently.  throw short, stout planes upwards. 

, Fill a saucepan with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water and place a heat-safe bowl on top; make sure that the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the surface of the water. Place the chocolate into the bowl and set the heat to medium. Stir the chocolate until it melts, then set it aside to cool.   Reserve the remaining 1.6 ounces (50 grams) of chocolate for later.  Sift the flour into a large bowl first, then add the cocoa powder. Stir them briskly together until evenly combined, then add the sugar and salt.  Stir the ingredients together until everything is smooth and evenly combined. Make sure that there are no lumps, clumps, streaks, or swirls.  The chopped walnuts are not completely necessary, but they will give your brownies some extra flavor and texture. The chocolate will give them some extra crunch and chocolatey goodness.  Use a rubber spatula to smooth down the top before putting the brownies into the oven. They are ready when the edges look done but the center looks moist. Another way to test for doneness is by poking a toothpick in the center; if it comes out clean or if it has some moist crumbs clinging to it, the brownies are done.  Leave the brownies in the pan while they cool. If you plan on adding any frosting, allow them to cool completely before continuing, about 20 minutes. This will allow the frosting the set up much faster.  Combine the cocoa powder, vanilla extract, maple syrup, and oil in a bowl. Stir the ingredients together until they are evenly combined. There should be no lumps, clumps, streaks, or swirls.   If you don't have any maple syrup, use agave nectar instead.  Once you have the brownies completely covered, put the entire pan in the fridge so that the frosting can cool and set.   Keep the brownies in the pan while covering them with frosting. For an added touch, sprinkle a handful of chopped walnuts over the frosting.  If you have any leftovers, cover them with plastic wrap, and store them in the fridge.  

preheat your oven to 350°f (177°c/gas mark 4) and place the baking rack in middle.  ,  melt 5.4 ounces (150 grams) of the chocolate in a double boiler over medium heat, then set it aside to cool.  combine the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, and salt in a separate bowl.  add the vanilla extract, oil, soy milk, and melted chocolate.  add the remaining chocolate, and if desired, the chopped walnuts.  pour the batter into a greased 8 by 8 inch (20.32 by 20.32 centimeters) square pan and bake for 20 to 25 minutes.  allow the brownies to cool, preferably on a cooling rack.  prepare the frosting if desired.  pour the frosting over the brownies and refrigerate it for at least 2 hours.use a rubber spatula to help spread the frosting evenly across the brownies.  cut the brownies into 16 squares and serve them. 

 You can think of a significant digit as an "interesting" or an "important" digit that gives you useful information about a number. This means that any zeroes to the right of whole numbers or to the left of decimals can be discounted because they are placeholders. To find the number of significant digits in a number, just count the number of digits from left to right. Here are some examples:1.239 has 4 significant digits 134.9 has 4 significant digits .0165 has 3 significant digits  , This depends on the problem you're working with. If you're rounding a number to two significant digits, for example, then you'll need to identify the second significant digit of the number and then use the number to the right of it to see if you should round it down or up. Here are some examples:1.239 rounded to 3 significant digits is 1.24. This is because the digit to the right of the third digit, 3, is a 9, which is 5 or more. 134.9 rounded to 1 significant digit is 100. This is because the digit to the right of the digit in the hundreds place, or the first digit, 1, is 3, which is less than 5. 0.0165 rounded to 2 significant digits is 0.017. This is because the second significant digit is 6, and the number to the right of it, 5, makes it round up.  To do this, you will first have to add up the numbers you are given. Then, you will have to find the number with the lowest amount of significant digits and then round your entire answer to that place. Here's how you do it:13.214 + 234.6 + 7.0350 + 6.38 = 261.2290 See that the second number, 234.6, is only accurate to the tenths place, or four significant digits. Round the answer so that it is only accurate to the tenths place. 261.2290 becomes 261.2.  First, multiply all of the numbers that you are given. Then, check them to see which number is rounded to the least amount of significant digits. Finally, round your finally answer to match the level of accuracy of that number. Here's how you do it:16.235 × 0.217 × 5 = 17.614975 Notice that the 5 number only has one significant digit. This means that your final answer will only have one significant digit as well. 17.614975 rounded to one significant digit becomes 20.  

understand what a significant digit is.  round a number to an amount of significant digits.  round to the correct number of significant digits in addition.  round to the correct number of significant digits in multiplication. 

 Tortoises should be bathed at least 3-4 times per week. Some experts recommend bathing them every day when the weather is warm., Tortoises can harbor salmonella bacteria, which can make humans very ill, so it is important that you not bathe your turtle in the sink or bathtub.Salmonella is very resistant to disinfectants, so the best course of action is to buy or find a special tub for bathing your turtle, and use it only for that purpose.A plastic bucket, wash tub, or kitty litter pan makes an ideal tortoise bath; just make sure it's large enough to accommodate your tortoise.  To bathe your tortoise, you just need a tub, a toothbrush, and a jug or pitcher of lukewarm water. You should not use any kind of soap or shampoo on your turtle, unless it was specifically recommended by your vet., The water should be room temperature. Add the water slowly until it is the depth of the tortoise's chin, or a bit shallower. Don't add more water than this, as most tortoises can't swim and could drown if their head is below water.It can also be helpful to rest the bowl on a book, so that your create a "deep" and a "shallow" end in the water. Place the chelonian with his head at the shallow end. This enables his anus to be below the water line, which is great because they drink through their anus so it's a great way of making sure he is well hydrated.   Adding the water after the tortoise is in the tub ensures that you will not accidentally make the water too deep.  Just let your tortoise be in the water for 10 to 20 minutes. During this time the tortoise will drink water, and rehydrate further by absorbing water through its tail. It will also likely pass waste at this time.Usually it is sufficient to just let your tortoise soak and skip to the rinsing step, but once a week or so, you should give the tortoise a good scrub.  Be sure to lift the tortoise out of the water while you pour the water out, to make sure it doesn't fall.  Use a toothbrush and gently scrub the entire shell, paying special attention to any areas of buildup. Then scrub the tortoise's legs, tail, and neck, but be careful with these areas as they are more sensitive. Finally, scrub the turtle's plastron (belly), and be sure to remove all dirt between the scutes or scales., This is the perfect time to check your tortoise all over for any sign of injury or disease. If you see anything out of the ordinary, take your turtle to the veterinarian to have it checked out right away. Common signs of illness include swollen eyelids or ears, other swellings on the body, skin abnormalities, and discolored or fuzzy patches on the shell that may indicate shell rot., Rinse your tortoise thoroughly using lukewarm water from your pitcher. Then place the tortoise on a towel, and wrap it up and over the tortoise to thoroughly blot the tortoise dry. You can then return your shiny, clean tortoise back to its enclosure., To avoid the risk of salmonella contamination, you should not pour soiled tortoise-water down the sink. Flush it down the toilet, instead, and be sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water when you are done.  

bathe your tortoise often.  obtain a dedicated tortoise-washing tub.  assemble your other supplies.  place the tortoise in the tub and slowly add the water.  let the tortoise soak.  pour out the soiled water, and refill the tub with clean water.  scrub the tortoise's shell.  inspect your tortoise as you scrub it.  rinse and dry the tortoise.  dispose of soiled bathwater carefully. 

 Slowly mix together in the boiling water. Try to get a sticky dough mixture.; , Only sprinkle lightly and spread out evenly.  Begin to fold the flour into the dough. Knead for a few minutes and add more flour if necessary. Stop when you have reached a consistency that does not stick any more.  Place the dough on the side and let it rest for 30 minutes in room temperature., Dust your rolling pin with flour and roll each half into a thin layer about 1/2cm (0.2inch) in thickness.  Place the excess dough on the side; don't throw it out.  Put two circles together. While storing the circles, place them under the towel to keep in the moisture. , Dry heating is basically heating something without liquid, such as oil. When the pan is hot, add a pancake to it.  Then remove the pieces in half.  Or, after all of the pancakes has been made. 

combine the flour and sugar.  sprinkle flour in the mixture and onto the surface of your counter space.  scoop the dough onto the surface.  cover the dough with a towel.  remove the towel and divide the dough in half.  use your cutter and cut out circles in the rolled dough.  use a bit of oil on one side of each circle.  repeat the flouring stage as you re-roll them each pair together.  ,  dry heat a frying pan over medium heat.  cook each side for about 1 1/2 minutes.  store under the towel until ready to serve. 

 By asking them what they like, you’ll give them the opportunity to talk and volunteer information. Because of this, you’ll be off the hook for talking and may be able to just follow their lead.   Make the inquiry sound casual. Say something like, “What sort of stuff do you like on TV?”; , The one thing you and your barber have in common is the community you live in. Use this as common ground to initiate a broader conversation.   Ask them how long they’ve lived there. Inquire about whether they’ve visited local festivals, fairs, or other events. This is particularly relevant if a fair or festival is going on at that given moment. If you’re new to the community, ask them for recommendations about restaurants, bars, and more. This will give them an opportunity to talk about the things they like to do., Start off by asking your barber how long they’ve been cutting hair. This is a good ice breaker and might lead to other conversation subjects. In the end, you’ll learn more about your barber both as a professional and as a person.   Ask the barber how long they’ve worked at that location. Find out how long they’ve been cutting hair. Say something like “So, how long have you been a barber?”, Race, religion, and politics are taboo topics that you shouldn't talk about with people you don't know. It is possible that you could inadvertently insult someone when talking about these subjects. As a result, don't mention them.   If the your barber begins to talk about something that makes you uncomfortable, try to change the subject. If they continue to talk about it, say "Let's talk about something else.", Most barbers know that their job is to cut hair, not make small talk. As a result many of them will be able to sense if you don't want to chat. If this is the case, don't feel bad. Just make sure to be polite.  

ask them what tv shows or movies they like.  talk about your community.  inquire about their work experience.  avoid talking about race, religion, or politics.  know that it is alright not to talk. 

 They need to be at room temperature. If they're not, they'll be very difficult to work with and won't warrant the results you're looking for.; , Set an ungreased baking sheet aside. A double-thick aluminum half-sheet pan with rolled edges is a good sheet to use. To avoid extra clean up time, line it with parchment paper.  This isn't part of the dough; it'll be used to form a coating and on top when the cookies are done.  Beat them together until your mixture is nice and smooth. You may find that the butter isn't absorbing into the cream cheese easily--just keep mixing.   If you use a low-fat version of either, the two may never fully combine. Though it's better for your waistline and health, higher-fat products will yield better looking results.  When the egg is well mixed in, add 1 tsp (5 g) vanilla. Don't beat any more than you have to or the mixture might grow thin.  Beat it slowly so that you don't make a mess. You'll know when you're done where there are no more lumps.   If the lumps seem to stay and you don't want to over beat your batter, take the back of the spoon and crush the lumps against the wall of the bowl.  This will firm up the dough so you can roll it into balls more easily. You may consider putting it in the freezer if your tummy is rumbling, but good (better) things come to those who wait.  Since the dough is cold, it shouldn't stick to your hands. If you want bite-size cookies or monster cookies, use more or less dough. A tablespoon is good for an average-sized cookie.   If you don't want to go mano-a-mano with the dough, a melon baller is a good tool to utilize in this situation. If you do make bigger or smaller cookies, adjust the oven times as necessary. Keep an eye on your treats, regardless.  Once it's coated, shake it a bit so the excess falls off (into the bowl). If you're worried about too much sugar, sprinkle it over all the sides. But really, though, too much sugar? Is there such a thing?  , Leave 2" (5 cm) between them when you place them on the baking sheet so that they can cook evenly.  Be careful not to overcook them -- you want them to stay gooey! If you've made smaller or bigger cookies, bake them less or more, respectively.   If your oven bakes unequally, flip the sheet halfway through. This guarantees that half your cookies aren't baked more than the rest.  Allow the cookies to cool slightly on the baking sheet before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely. Sniff until cooled, then dig in!   If desired, sprinkle the cooled cookies with more confectioners' sugar before serving. 

set out your cream cheese and a stick of butter.  preheat the oven to 350 f (180 c).  place 1/4 cup (50 g) of confectioners' sugar in a small bowl and set it aside.  mix the cream cheese and butter in a large mixing bowl.  beat in the egg.  add the chocolate cake mix to the bowl.  cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 2 hours.  roll a tablespoon of the dough into a ball.  roll the cookie ball in the sugar to coat it.  place the balls on the baking sheet and continue making more.  bake the cookies for 12 minutes.  take the cookies out of the oven.  finished.

 To make an initial contact, email is fine. If you don’t receive a response or if you’d like to talk to them directly, a phone call is then a good option. Be aware that you may have to call and leave message multiple times before hearing back. This is normal, especially with part-time breeders.If you leave a message simply give your name and phone number as well as your desire for a puppy of a certain breed. It also helps if you can state how you found out about this breeder.  Either over the phone or through email conversations you must get more information about the breeder’s background. You can ask why they entered into this process. You can find out how long they’ve been in business in the same location. You can ask how many puppies they’ve successfully placed and how many ‘returns’ they’ve had and why., A good breeder should be an expert of all things related to the dogs that they breed. Request that the breeder tell you about the good and bad characteristics of your potential pet, as a group. Ask about the breed’s care requirements and any immediate suggestions that your breeder can offer. A good breeder will be happy to share their knowledge (and show off a bit!)A good breeder will not possess an encyclopedic knowledge of all dogs. Instead, they will focus solely on 1-2 specific breeds and that is it. Be very wary of breeders who promise that they can get you any type of dog that you want., A good breeder will only sell puppies that they’ve bred and raised personally or in-house. These means that they may not always have puppies instantly available to sell and that is a good thing. In fact, it is generally better to find a breeder with a bit of a wait list as it shows that they are in demand.You can ask a breeder how many litters they raise per year in order to get an idea as to the scope of their operation. This is a good way to avoid “puppy mill” operations. A good breeder should just raise 1-2 litters a year to give enough time for care and proper placement., Most breeders will not let you take your puppy home until it is somewhere between 8-12 weeks old. This allows it to play and socialize with its littermates and mom, creating much happier, healthier dog in the end. A breeder should inform you of this timeline and provide information as to the number and overall health of litter., Most purebred dogs will come with some type of health documentation attesting to the dog’s overall genetic well-being. Look for documentation from stand-alone groups, such as the Canine Eye Registration Foundation. This will show that the dog’s relatives were tested and cleared.Do some research on your own to find out what specific health documentation you should request. Certain breeds are prone to particular genetic issues. German Shepherds, for example, are genetically predisposed for hip dysplasia and can be tested by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals.Also, be aware that a good breeder will wait until a dog pair is 2-3 years of age before attempting breeding. This is because some genetic conditions wait a few years before manifesting.  Your breeder should be able to have a clear conversation regarding their general approach regarding breeding and care. You want a breeder that lives closely with their animals, as opposed to boarding them in a distant garage. You want a breeder that emphasizes socialization and frequent handling of the puppies.You also want a breeder that is passionate about purity and a particular breed. Don’t give your business to breeders who promise the unusual or bizarre. Breeding to get extreme sizes, for example, can lead to dogs with a variety of serious health problems., A good breeder wants their dogs in the best possible homes. They, therefore, will often make you sign a contract promising to return the dog (at any stage of life) if you no longer want it for whatever reason. They will also be willing to refund your money if your dog manifests a genetic illness as an adult or gets sick as a young puppy., A breeder should be able to provide you with tons of personal references. They can give you the names of other people who’ve purchased from them recently and in the distant past. They can put you in contact with local vets who can provide records of treatment of care. The best breeders also have other breeders who will provide references for them., Good breeders will ask you a wide variety of questions before even placing you on a waitlist for a future puppy. They will want you to explain your motivation for owning a dog. They will also ask about your daily care plans for the puppy and the composition of your household. Be as forthcoming as you can with all information as it will lead to a better experience overall.Similar to some rescue organizations, a good breeder might also request documentation from your landlord (if you are a renter) stating that you can own a pet of this breed.  The breeder will provide you with a contract that specifies what each party owes the other. Make sure that you get this contract well in advance and that you carefully read it, noting any questions that you may have. The contract will contain details regarding payment, delivery of the puppy, care of the puppy, health guarantees, among other information.Your contract may also contain a clause specifying your agreement to have the puppy spayed or neutered. This is a good sign of a breeder trying to avoid pet overpopulation. 

get ahold of them via phone or email.  find out about the breeder’s experience and credentials.  ask about the breed.  inquire about the source of the puppies.  request information about the particular litter.  get information on any health guarantees.  discuss the breeder’s care philosophy.  discuss the worst case scenarios.  request references.  expect to be interviewed.  pay attention to the contract.

Stretch it until it's big and square and it should look pretty much like mine. ERRORS: If you have errors or error values, you've made a mistake somewhere along the line. Select the cell that has the error value that is furthest left and topmost first. Look for a typo in a formula or unmatched parentheses. Possibly, a Defined Name is wrong -- they need to be input into the formulas exactly as they were defined. Do Insert Name Define to check. if you have DIV/0! If you don't, look for a variable that somehow did not get filled in with a value perhaps. At any rate, what you want to do is select the cell with the error, and after checking all those typical errors, do Tools Auditing Trace Precedents and/or Trace Error. If fixing a few topmost leftmost errors does not fix the rest of your errors on your worksheet, you may need to do it the hard way, from the bottom right upwards then leftwards.

 This includes items you may carry in your pockets such as pens, keys, or small pistols.; , Clenched fists give away your readiness to strike. Open hands present a non-threatening appearance that will cause an attacker to let his guard down, while still leaving you the options to suddenly strike or grab.  Screaming may draw attention and scare the attacker away.  What use is any other defense tactic if you get knocked out?  , To form the hand for a palm-heel strike, bend the wrist back at a 90 degree angle and spread and claw the fingers. For an edge of hand blow, straighten the fingers and press them together, and strike with the muscle in the side of the hand. When striking down into an assailant's face, clench the fist and strike with the little finger side. Closed fist punches rely on wrist strength and stability to deliver a proper strike, and the knuckles are easily broken in the confusion of a fight.  These areas are easy to hit and will probably knock the enemy down for your chance to escape. Remember that a heavy strike to a person's face is highly effective at making them lose their senses. A broken nose or strike to the eyes will greatly hinder your opponent's ability to observe and react. Do not strike a person in the mouth--this will damage your hand.  So can headbutting.  The eyes and throat are especially vulnerable areas.  Instead, use your knee repeatedly.  Not only could this cause their nose to bleed, but it will cause their eyes to water, giving you a chance of escape.  If an attacker gets a hold of you and doesn't have a firearm pointed to your head or a knife to your neck, squirm. Squirming and pinching the attacker can help you get out of his or her clutches. If the attacker has a weapon, keep it away from you.  Kicking the jaw off of an unconscious person isn't self defense, it's a lack of self control. 

remember that every part of your body and everything on your person has the potential to be used as a weapon.  open your hands and keep them in front of you in a pleading position when confronted by a potential attacker.  scream.  block or dodge an oncoming attack.  strike with the heel of your hand, or with the meaty little-finger side of your fist.  aim for sensitive areas such as face, stomach, groin, knee, shin and instep.  if you are in close proximity to your attacker, jabbing with your elbows and fingers can be an effective method of defense.  if necessary, use any hard item available to poke, jab or scratch your assailant's face: a stick, a brick, a pen, a piece of glass, etc.  never kick your attacker in the groin, this gives them a chance to grab hold of your leg.  using the heel of your palm, hit the attacker's nose upwards.  squirm.  once you have taken your attacker down and they are no longer a threat, stop attacking.  call police once your attacker is no longer a threat.  

 A Pell Grant is a need-based grant that you will not need to repay. Getting a Pell Grant is determined by your financial need, which is calculated with the FAFSA. It has nothing to do with merit or your grades. If you do get a Pell Grant, you need to remember to re-apply each year to make sure you keep getting the money, and make sure you graduate in six years.If you are currently incarcerated in a federal or state institution, you cannot get a Federal Pell Grant or federal student loans. However, you will not be considered incarcerated if you are in a halfway house, home detention, if you serve only on weekends, or if you are confined to a correctional institution while awaiting trial.Therefore, if you are not considered incarcerated, you may be eligible for federal student aid.  There are hundreds of scholarships available for people of all backgrounds and for all types of programs. In most cases, being a convicted felon will not bar you from applying or receiving these scholarships. Look for scholarships that are designed to help someone like you, which may include references to your religion, family status, or personal background.You can consult colleges, libraries, online databases, or the Federal Student Aid website for lists of scholarships. Consider searching for scholarships that are meant for felons.Your felony conviction may make a powerful story if your scholarship requires an essay. If you decide to talk about your conviction, make sure you indicate how you have grown from the experience, and how it will make you a better college student.  If you are a military veteran, or dependent of a veteran, you may be eligible for other academic assistance. Get your DD214 form to confirm your discharge in order to apply for benefits. Fill out a VA Form 22-1990, “Application for VA Education Benefits,” to see what you are eligible to get from the VA.It is important that your discharge from the military was an honorable one. If you are discharged for any other reason, you may not be eligible for other benefits.In terms of your conviction, it needs to have come from a civilian court, not a court martial. Court martial convictions may be considered felonies, though you should consult a lawyer to see if that is the case in your state., Once you have exhausted your options for federal and state aid, look into getting a loan from a bank or other financial institution. Make sure you look at the bank’s requirements to make sure you will qualify for their loans.There are many options out there for student loans. Before applying, make sure you will be able to get the amount of money you need, and that you will be able to pay it back. There are several websites out there to help you compare loan options, which you should look at before applying for one.As a felon, you probably will not have great credit, meaning you are a risk to a financial institution making a loan. To help your cause, you will need a cosigner, who is agreeing to assume responsibility if you cannot pay the debt. Cosigners are usually close relatives, like parents or siblings, but they can be any adult that you trust and has strong enough credit for the bank.Keep in mind that cosigners will be liable for your debts and will be responsible for paying them if you default. If you fail to pay your loans, your cosigner will be on the hook and it will most likely cause rifts in your relationship.  

get a pell grant.  get a scholarship.  use the gi bill.  apply for a private loan. 

 You can find lots of helpful information here: http://www.lamaze.org/. This website provides access to emailed weekly pregnancy advice, online classes, and tips. The website also describes what to expect from a typical Lamaze class.  Use Lamaze’s online locator tool to find a certified instructor close to you: http://www.lamaze.org/FindALamazeChildbirthClass. Once you have your list of potential options and their contact information, speak with several teachers and ask them questions about themselves and the course. You want someone who makes you feel comfortable and open, as they’ll be helping you through an intimate and important process in your life.The locator tool will allow you to search by the name of a specific instructor who may have been recommended to you, or to enter your desired proximity up to 50 miles (80.47 km) away from your zipcode.  Classes can be held in hospitals, birthing centers, healthcare providers’ offices, homes, or community centers. Lamaze’s online locator tool lists the locations of various courses along with the instructors. The website also provides a map showing the distances from the course locations to your home. If you’re taking a weekly class, you may want to prioritize convenience. Be sure, however, that the space you choose is one in which you can relax., Typical Lamaze classes include comprehensive, 12-hour coverage of labor, birth, early baby care, breastfeeding, and healthy lifestyle tips. These classes should also teach you relaxation, breathing, and massage techniques for pain management during labor and delivery. Check to make sure your instructor’s course plan adheres to these standards.Many expectant mothers appreciate Lamaze for its non-judgmental approach to medical intervention during labor. Lamaze classes will not encourage you to choose one birth plan over another. Lamaze instead fosters confidence and communication skills so that pregnant women can make safe and calm decisions during delivery., It’s important to ensure that you’re learning from a person who has the necessary training. Lamaze International offers the only internationally recognized childbirth education certification. If you found your instructor using the Lamaze website, you can rest assured that they’re fully certified. If you found your instructor on your own, ask the instructor to provide a record of their certification.If you’re taking your course at a hospital or healthcare provider’s office, you’ll likely receive instruction from a registered nurse (RN) who has also been certified to teach Lamaze.  Most Lamaze classes include 12 hours of instruction spread over six weeks in two-hour class sessions. Some instructors may also offer an intensive weekend session of two classes lasting six hours per day.While some expectant mothers might appreciate quickly finishing the course, weekly sessions may be better first-time parents who need time to absorb all the new material., If you are looking to meet other women or couples who are also experiencing pregnancy, a group class may be right for you. These classes will offer less one-on-one instruction, but they will also usually be more affordable., This type of instruction is generally more flexible because the classes are arranged around your needs, and the course may even be held in your home. Private classes will be totally focused on you and your partner, and you can ask any personal questions that you might be afraid to introduce in a group setting. However, this option will almost certainly be more costly., Be sure that your instructor has a maximum class size. Smaller class sizes of no more than 24 students are best. If you’re able to find a course with 10-12 students, this will provide you with the optimal level of individual and group instruction., Various courses will differ in cost. Popular Lamaze instructors with a well established following may be able to charge more than newer instructors. Smaller classes may also be more expensive than those open to larger groups. Try to balance your needs with your budget., Your loved ones will be familiar with your personality and birthing needs. They’ll be able to provide targeted advice that combines their likes and dislikes of their past Lamaze classes and instructors with what they know about your preferences.Remember to put your desires first. Don’t allow advice from those who are close to you to drown out what you want from your classes.  Since Lamaze classes don’t typically start until you’re about seven months pregnant, you shouldn’t worry about scheduling a course as soon as you get pregnant. Your doctor can suggest the appropriate timeline for reaching out to instructors, making your choice, and finalizing your reservation. Consider the course an exciting indicator that you’ve reached your last few months of pregnancy., It’s important to have a support network in place during pregnancy, labor, delivery, and after you give birth. Choose a partner, friend, or family member and make sure they’re fully prepared to invest their time and energy in these classes. You can work with them to make sure the classes don’t clash with their other obligations. Taking this class together will help you both build a relationship of trust you can rely on when it counts.Be sure to ask instructors whether they expect and allow partner participation.  Your instructor will likely offer a variety of options to fit their students’ scheduling needs. Try to pick a time that doesn’t clash with other events on your schedule, as you don’t want your classes to feel like an obligation.Most instructors will expect that at least some of their students work during the weekdays, and they should be prepared with several options to fit into a full-time work schedule.  Once you’ve decided on a course, contact the instructor and reserve your spot. They may send you some paperwork to sign, and they may require payment in part or in full when you make your reservation. 

visit lamaze international’s website to learn about the program.  contact instructors in your area.  pick a location for your class.  read your potential instructors’ curricula.  check on your instructor’s training.  decide how often you want to attend class.  choose group classes for lower costs and more social interaction.  pick private classes for individual instruction that fits your schedule.  ask about class size.  evaluate the costs of different options.  ask your family and friends for their advice.  ask your healthcare provider when to reserve your spot in the class.  involve your partner or a friend before you schedule the class.  assess your and your partner’s daily and weekly schedules.  contact your chosen provider. 

 This will be your house. You can downsize it if you want if your stuffed animal is small, but if it is larger, you'll need a larger box!; , Mahogany and white for bricks, whatever color for siding, dark brown for wood, whatever materials for a house and the comprehending color(s).  You can do a glass door in blue and white, brown, black, gray, etc. Wood doors are the same, but don't use blue. Folding doors? Whatever color you want!

 You don’t have to wear anything other than eyeshadow, but it is helpful to plan your face makeup out if you do wear it. You could go with a subtle look of matte foundation, light blush, and nude lips. It’s also an option to take the look all the way and use colorful highlighter, contouring, and bright lips. Set out the makeup, but wait to do it until you’ve done your eyeshadow because it tends to fallout as you apply it.Rainbow highlighter is available in most beauty supply stores and online. Choose a color of your rainbow eyeshadow, like red, for bright lipstick.; , Use a primer that is specifically made to be underneath eyeshadow. Simply dab the primer on your lids where you will be applying the eyeshadow. If you don’t have a primer, put a little foundation and powder on the eyelids to achieve an even base. These additions will ensure the shadows don't fade too quickly.You can also add a white primer or white eyeshadow to make the rainbow eyeshadow pop even more when it is applied.  Three brushes are ideal to use for this look. Get out a pencil type brush, a blending or crease brush, and a larger highlight color brush. Set out your eyeshadow after the brushes. Then, put out some cotton swabs, makeup remover, and foundation so you can correct any mistakes you may make.Make sure the brushes are clean because dirty brushes can harbor germs and will make your eyeshadow colors appear muddy You can still achieve this look if you don’t have all of these brushes, but it may not be as easy.  A bright pink eye or red shadow is a good option for the first color, but you can start with a different color. Just make sure the next color you apply can fade into the next. Dab the eyeshadow out towards the inner corner of the lid with a highlight brush.Tap your brushes off first before applying each of the next eyeshadows so you don't get fallout on your cheeks.  Begin to add an orange eye shadow right next to the pink or red. The orange should be applied to the center of your eyelid. Again, use the highlighter brush to do this. Then, begin to blend the two shades together with a blending brush..   If you started with a different color, look at the colors of the rainbow and follow with a color that is close to the color you chose on the spectrum. For example, apply green next if you started with yellow. Dab the eyeshadow application brush onto a paper towel between the two colors so the colors do not blend on the brush.  Use the highlighter brush again to apply a yellow eye shadow. Put the yellow on top of where the orange has begun to fade. Fade the yellow slightly further along to the outer edges of your eyelid.If you chose a different color, apply a color that would follow that color on the spectrum. For example, apply blue now if green was your second color.  For the green and blue part of the rainbow, apply the eyeshadow with a pencil brush. Apply the green eyeshadow just below your waterline and near your bottom eyelashes. Fade the color a little further along the lower eye. It should come to the middle of your bottom eyelashes.An indigo-like color would be the next color if blue was your last color.  Apply a strip of blue eyeshadow slightly onto the green. Fade that almost to the inner corner of your lower eyelid. It should meet with the pink eyeshadow you started with in the corner of your eye.If indigo or violet was your last color, you could finish with a pop of red or pink.  Look at the rainbow eye shadow in a mirror. Use your application brush to neatly blend the colors together. Don’t blend all of the colors together—just the colors the outer edges of the colors that are next to each other. To get the most seamless effect possible between colors, use a clean brush, or even a clean finger to lightly mix the colors together. This will create new colors to ease the transition.At this point you can use foundation or cotton swabs to correct any mistakes. If you think a color does not look bright enough, simply go back and repeat a step until you're satisfied.  This isn’t necessary, but it can enhance the look. Line the top eyelid, just above the waterline, with black eyeliner. Or, you can stay colorful and use a bright blue or colored eyeliner., Curl your lashes before applying mascara. A black, volumizing mascara would make the overall look bolder. You can also go for a subtler look with a clear mascara, or continue the colorful look with a deep blue mascara.It’s also an option to use false eyelashes.  

plan your face makeup.  prime your eyes.  set out your brushes and shadows.  dab the first shadow on the inner corners of your eyes.  apply the next color to the center of your eyelid.  move on to the outer edges of your eyelids.  apply the next color below your waterline.  finish with the inner corner of your lower eyelid.  blend the shadows for a seamless transition.  apply eyeliner.  finish the look with mascara. 

 The most basic absolute value equation will appear as y=|x|. Other numbers or variables may be involved though.  To do this, make everything in the absolute value lines | | =0. If we use the example y=|x-2|+1, then we get the absolute value by making |x-2|=0. Then the absolute value becomes 2.   The absolute value is the number of points from |x| to ‘0’ on a number line. So the absolute value of |2| is 2, and the absolute value of |-2| is also two. This is because in both cases, ‘2’ and ‘-2’ are 2 steps away from zero on the number line. You may have an absolute value equation where ‘x’ is alone. In that case, the absolute value is ‘0’. For example, y=|x|+3 changes to y=|0|+3, which equals to ‘3’.  You want it to have two rows and three columns.   Put the first absolute value coordinate in the into the top center column for ‘X’. Choose two other numbers an equal distance from your x-coordinate in each direction (positive and negative). If |x|=0, then move up and down an equal number of spaces from ‘0’. You can choose any numbers, although ones that are near the x-coordinate are most helpful. They must also be whole numbers.  You need to find the y-coordinate that pairs with the three x-coordinates you have. To do this, substitute the x-coordinate values into the inequality and solve for ‘y’. Fill these answers in on your table.  You only need three points to graph an absolute value equation, but you can use more if you would like. An absolute value equation will always form a “V” shape on your graph. Add arrows to the ends to show that the line extends further than the edge of your graph. 

examine your equation.  make the absolute value equal to 0.  make a table.  solve the inequality.  graph the points. 

 Parakeets love company and will welcome a new friend, especially if you’re often at work. If you decide to buy an additional bird, make sure that the cage is big enough for two parakeets.Separate the birds at first. Put them in different cages to let them look at each other. Bring the cages closer after a few days. They will get used to each other. After two weeks, put the new bird in the cage of the resident parakeet. Always monitor the reaction. If any conflict occurs, separate the birds and try to reintroduce them again later.  If you are often away, your bird might get lonely and depressed. It’s always good to turn on the radio or the TV and provide your bird with entertainment.   You could also record your voice and play it when away. Make sure to put music you like. Your bird might start singing what it heard. If leaving a radio or television talk show on, consider the language being used as your bird may repeat some of the dialogue. Think about the volume. You don't want the sound to be too loud as the bird must be given the opportunity to sleep.  Parakeets are playful animals and love toys. You can buy a great variety of them in your favorite pet shop. You should provide an assortment of toys to chew, explore and climb.Birds need at least one new toy a month. Toys are a necessity, not a luxury, for birds. Rotate toys regularly to keep them fresh and interesting for your bird and allow you time to clean them. Toys will help keep your bird entertained and happy. Try different toys to see which your bird really enjoys. Any metal, except stainless steel isn't safe, because it could contain zinc.Always check toys for safety, making sure there is no way your bird can get stuck in or on them. Make sure toys are of appropriate size for your bird.  Placing the cage near or in a window can provide an entertaining vantage point into the outside world. Your bird will be able to enjoy watching all the events that take place outside while you are away.  Avoid any windows with direct sunlight. This can be too hot and too bright for you bird to be comfortable in. Check the window for any cold drafts or air. If the window allows chilly air to pass through, don't put your bird near it, as cold temperatures can be harmful to it. Make sure your window is shut. Even if your bird is in a cage, take no risks. The bird may find a way out, or something could find a way in, if the window is open.  

introduce a new parakeet.  turn on the radio.  provide plenty of toys.  place the cage near a window. 

 You can begin with a milder method, or start with this one if you don’t want to take your chances on leaving the stain for too long. It’s also an option to use a clear alcohol, like vodka, if you don’t have isopropyl alcohol around. Just try not to drink any of it while you clean., Don’t start working on the stain just yet. Instead, find a hidden or small spot on the wood floor. Dab the cloth on a very small spot to make sure it doesn’t damage the wood. If it does, abandon this method now. It’s okay. There’s another way to remove the stain.It is still an option to use the alcohol even if it does slightly discolor the wood. You could just sand it down and go over the floor with a wood stain to make it like new again.  Use the cloth that has been dampened with isopropyl alcohol to begin scrubbing off the stain. You’ll know the alcohol is working if the stain begins to transfer to the cloth. Continue to scrub until the stain is gone and relief begins to wash over you., Once the stain has been scrubbed off, rinse off the wood. You can pour some water on the wood and dry it off with a towel. Or, wet a fresh cloth and then let the wood air dry. You’re done! Sit back and relax. 

pour isopropyl alcohol on a cloth.  test the surface of the wood.  wipe off the stain with a cloth and isopropyl alcohol.  rinse and dry the wood. 

 If you spill on a leatherette surface, the best thing to do is wipe up the spill immediately using a damp cotton or wool cloth. This will help to prevent the development of stains.For example, if your child spills juice on your leatherette car interior, you can dip a cotton cloth in water, wring out the water so the cloth is damp, and then wipe down the surface with the cloth. Once the spill has been wiped up, dry the leatherette using a clean dry cloth.  In some cases you may not be able to remove a stain by simply wiping the leatherette with warm water. In these cases you will need to use a soap and water mixture. In a small bowl, combine warm water with a tablespoon of mild dish soap or hand soap., Then, dip a soft cloth into the water and soap mixture and wring it out so that the cloth is damp, but not dripping wet. Using the damp cloth, wipe the entire leatherette surface with soapy water., After you have wiped the entire surface with soapy water, take a new cloth and dip it in a bowl of plain water. Wring out the towel so that it is damp, but not dripping wet. Once the cloth is wet, wipe the entire leatherette surface. This will help to rinse away any soap that remains on the leatherette., Once the leatherette has been rinsed, use a clean dry cloth to dry the surface. Rub the cloth over the entire surface until it is completely dry. 

wipe up spills immediately.  combine mild soap with warm water.  wipe down the surface with a cloth.  rinse the surface with warm water.  dry with a cloth. 

 Use a cleanser to do this until your face is clean, and then dry your face.; , Make sure to use everything if necessary; Exfoliator, Moisturizer, Cleanser, Toner, etc. (A good brand would be Clinique.)  , What you need totally depends on your skin tone. If your skin is "bad", a good foundation is totally fine as long as you blend well and remove it every night. Concealer is to be use sparingly for little problem spots as it can look cakey. If your skin is nice, go for a tinted moisturizer or BB Cream; it will give you a healthy glow. ^^Set that with translucent or bronzing powder.  The helps your eyeshadow to last longer. If you don't have an eye primer, the look of foundation, cream bases, or concealer will do the job too.   Using a fluffy brush will blend the shadow.  If you feel it, feel free to use a soft gray instead. For more definition: sweep a darker shade into the crease and outer corner and highlight your brow-bone with a light shade.  It will give great subtle definition if used properly! If you have ex. brown eyes, they will look great with a pop of purple, blue or green beneath the eye, but feel free to stick to black, charcoal, or brown. If your eyes are small, a white or peach line on your waterline will open them up.  If it really suits you, you can also wing out your liner for a dramatic and trendy effect!  , If they're naturally curly though, you can skip this step!  , If you're a brunette, black (or clear if your lashes are already really black) is most likely the color for you. If blonde or red-head, you might want to opt for a brown, dark brown, or black/brown.  It makes your eyebrows look a lot better, and helps your makeup look ten times better.    It's your choice whether to go for blush or not. If you want to, cream blushes are a great idea since their finish is really natural and dewy. If your skin tends to get super-oily though, powder blushes are great. Use a rosy, peachy, or berry color depending on your natural flush.  This will help it to last. Setting your makeup will help it last longer and help it not wear off throughout the day.  If wanted, apply a fun lip color. Make sure it's not too bold! A natural flush or naturally nuded-out lips are the way to go. Use a balm before-hand! Or just use gloss. 

wash your face.  come up with a skin care routine, one that fits your specific type of skin.  even out your skin tone.  prime your eyes before doing eyeshadow.  apply a natural-looking (if wanted shimmery) eyeshadow to your eyelids.  line your lower lash line/waterline.  if you want your eyelashes to look thicker and darker, blend an eyeliner into the upper lashes - liquid, pencil, or gel, it's totally up to you!,  curl your eyelashes lightly to prep them for easy mascara application.  use one or two coats of a mascara that goes well with your hair color.  use a brow grooming brush.  use a blush to add color to the cheek.  set your makeup with a setting powder.  add color.  finish off with lip gloss or lip balm.  

 Before you can admit your lies to your boyfriend, you must acknowledge them on your own. Sometimes, you can repeat a lie over and over again to the point that you start to believe it. In order to break this cycle, you must admit that there is a problem.Say it aloud to yourself: “I have been dishonest with Matt for a long time now. I need to tell the truth.” It may also help to share this admission with a friend. Confiding in someone else about your lies can serve as a way to practice coming clean to your boyfriend. Plus, if you choose someone who is understanding and supportive, he or she can give you the courage to finally tell the truth.; , It may be tempting to want to spill your guts over a phone call or a text message. However, coming clean after months of lying requires sensitivity in how you handle the situation. Set a date with your boyfriend ahead of time so that you can talk in-person without distractions.   Leave your cell phone in another room. This is important not only to minimize distractions, but it will also reduce negative feelings. Studies show that when a pair is discussing a meaningful topic, the presence of a cell phone can increase feelings of distrust and compromise relationship quality., A full confession is best and will actually help you feel better about yourself.You may believe that a partial confession is more likely to preserve your boyfriend’s feelings (e.g. “If I tell him how long I’ve been lying, he will be devastated.”) Nonetheless, only coming halfway clean will simply reinforce your lying habit. Be completely honest about what you have been feeling.   For instance, you might start off the discussion by saying something that denotes the seriousness of the situation and gets straight to the point. “I wanted to talk about my feelings for you…” or “I have been dishonest with you for a while now. I need to tell you the truth about my feelings…” is a forthright way to start the conversation.  “I” statements give you an opportunity to take ownership for your own feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. As opposed to “you” statements that trigger defensiveness, “I” statements build bridges to increase trust and openness.Be specific in your remarks while avoiding “should” statements or labels. Include your thoughts and feelings.   An example of a potential “I” statement for this scenario might be: “I am feeling ashamed about not telling you the truth before now. I care about you and didn’t want to hurt you, but I know I have.”  , Just as your wording should emphasize that you are taking full responsibility for your lie, your words should also reflect remorse. Let your boyfriend know how terrible you feel about lying. Being able to own up to your guilt is an integral part of moving forward.Tell him "I'm very sorry that I kept this from you. I feel ashamed, like I have disappointed you. I hope that you can come to forgive me someday." Take note that you can request forgiveness, but only he has the power to grant it to you.  Just as you should be forthright and take ownership of your lie, you also want to emphasize honesty going forward. If your boyfriend asks any clarifying questions about your deception, answer them as truthfully as you can.   For example, if he asks “When did you know how you really felt?,” you need to be clear: “I have known that I was no longer in love with you since April. I just didn’t know how to tell you the truth.”  

admit the lie to yourself first.  meet face-to-face with your boyfriend.  be forthright.  use “i” statements.  apologize.  answer any questions truthfully. 

 Your body needs carbohydrates to give energy to your cells. Since carbohydrates break down into glucose (a natural sugar, and your body's preferred energy source) you'll need to consider where you're getting these very necessary carbohydrates from. Choose complex carbohydrates that take your body longer to break down, which can control your blood sugar.Get complex carbohydrates from:   Whole grains Cereals Vegetables Fruit Beans Legumes; , There's really no such thing as a healthy sugar,so you should eat it in moderation. The American Heart Association recommends limiting your sugar intake to 6 teaspoons (25 g or 100 calories) a day if you're a woman, and 9 teaspoons (37.5 g or 150 calories) a day if you're a man.Try to avoid simple sugars like table sugar (sucrose) which can be quickly broken down by the body.   Try to reduce your intake of soda, sweetened beverages, candy, cakes, cookies, and pies.  Instead of reaching for simple table syrup, replace it with another sweetener that has nutrients. Honey contains some vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, including vitamins C and B6, folate, niacin, riboflavin, calcium, iron, and manganese.Since honey is made up of a combination of complex sugars, studies have shown that it's easier on your blood sugar. It also tastes sweeter than sucrose (table sugar), so you can use less., Molasses is another nutritional sweetener that breaks down into sucrose, although it takes longer for your body to break down. It also contains calcium and magnesium which are good for your bones. Studies have shown that molasses contains iron, potassium and antioxidants.Since molasses has a distinctive strong taste, you may prefer to substitute molasses for sugar when baking.  Molasses and honey are just a few variations of sweeteners that break down into sucrose and glucose. But, because of the minor health benefits, they're seen as "less bad" for you than table sugar. Other natural sweeteners include:   Agave syrup Maple syrup Brown sugar (which has a bit of molasses included) Coconut sugar (which contains some fiber)  , Stevioside and Rebaudioside are both marketed as stevia and come from the stevia rebaudiana shrub. Stevia is anywhere from 30 to 300 times sweeter than sugar on a gram for gram basis. It's a popular substitute because it has no calories and can be used in baking and cooking. Studies have shown that stevia might be useful in lowering cholesterol and blood sugar levels.Stevia has a slightly bitter taste, so it's often combined with other sweeteners to mask the flavor.  Xylitol is the sweetest of the sugar alcohols, which are modified sugars. Dentists recommend using xylitol because it doesn't encourage tooth decay, unlike other sugars. It does contain calories, but xylitol doesn't raise blood sugar or insulin levels.The body has a hard time absorbing xylitol, so you may experience gas, bloating, and diarrhea, especially if you consume large amounts.Be aware that xylitol is extremely toxic to dogs and cats. If your pet ingests xylitol or a product containing xylitol (such as gum), call your vet immediately or Pet Poison Helpline (800-213-6680)., Erythritol is another sugar alcohol which is often mixed with stevia to mask stevia's bitter taste. Erythritol is 60 to 70 times sweeter than table sugar, but it doesn't increase blood glucose levels or affect cholesterol. Like xylitol, erythritol doesn't cause tooth decay (because bacteria don't digest it).   The Center for Science in the Public Interest recommends erythritol as a safe sugar alternative, although it can cause gas, bloating, diarrhea, or nausea in some people, after consuming large amounts., This syrup comes from the roots of the yacon plant. In addition to being a natural sweetener, it contains fructooligosaccharides (FOS) which can act as a prebiotic, supporting healthy gut bacteria.   Studies have also shown that eating yacon syrup every day may help with weight loss in people with insulin resistance., This sugar substitute contains fructose (sugar found in fruits and vegetables), sucrose, and lactose (milk sugar). It can be used very much like table sugar which means you can cook and bake with it (unlike artificial sweeteners).   Whey low is not completely absorbed by the body, so you get the sweetness without taking in many calories.Whey low contains 4 calories per teaspoon.  Chemical sweeteners like aspartame, sucralose, and saccharin are often found in diet foods and sodas. These no-calorie sweeteners contain no other nutrients. Research shows that they don't help with blood sugar or weight management.Many independent studies have linked these artificial sweeteners with cancer, leukemia, and irritable bowel disease.Pregnant women, children, and people with phenylketonuria (an inherited genetic disorder) should never use aspartame.You should also limit the amount of sucralose you give to small children, since they can easily get more sucralose than the FDA recommends.  Sugar has no nutritional value (no vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, etc). It does contain calories, but they're known as "empty calories" because there are no health benefits.   Sugar does provide some energy because it contains calories. Calories are a measurement of energy released by food. Keep in mind that whole foods, like fruit, containing naturally occurring sugars have nutritional value.  Some forms of sugar, like fructose, are only metabolized in the liver. If you eat a large amount of fructose, your liver can be overloaded, regardless of whether the fructose came from something healthy like apples or a processed food with high-fructose corn syrup.If your liver is already damaged, eating foods with added fructose can damage your liver even more.  Insulin resistance (also known as prediabetes) can lead to diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Studies suggest that sugar intake is directly linked to insulin resistance and contributes to obesity.Sugar intake is connected to the development of these diabetes and metabolic syndrome complications:Heart disease Nerve damage Blindness Kidney disease  , Studies have found that sugar is linked to chronic inflammation which is linked to diseases like obesity, diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease, arthritis, autoimmune disease, and cancer.Sugars (especially the high-fructose corn syrup-type) can raise cholesterol and fat levels like triglycerides in the blood. This can also increase the chances of becoming obese. 

pick complex carbohydrates.  limit your table sugar intake.  use honey.  eat molasses.  look for another nutritive sweetener.  consider stevia.  choose xylitol.  look for erythritol.  include yacon syrup.  try whey low.  consider the risks of artificial sweeteners.  recognize sugar's nutritional impact.  understand that sugar is processed by your liver.  consider sugar's connection to insulin resistance.  learn about sugar's connection to inflammation. 

 A good drum set mic setup will include 2 overhead mics for capturing the sound of the kit as a whole. Listen to the audio from these microphones and examine the tone - is it bright and punchy or dark and warm? The tone from your overhead mics is crucial to adjusting your EQ, because it establishes a kind of overall constraint.   For example, if your overhead mics produce a bright, crisp sound, then trying to make each individual drum sound dark and warm will be a losing battle. In this way, you should use the tone produced by your overhead mics as the general template for the type of tone you aim for when adjusting the EQ for each drum. EQ adjustment for the overhead mics should be minimal, but it often helps to roll off some of the low frequencies. This will make room for the floor tom and bass drum in these frequency bands.; , Your microphone setup will vary, but generally you want to have dedicated mics for the snare drum, bass drum, and hi-hats. A single mic can be used for toms, and cymbals can be picked up solely through the overhead mics if desired.   When adjusting the equalization for the snare drum, roll off most of the low frequencies. The depth of a snare drum's sound can be adjusted by moving the faders for mid frequencies, and the bright "crack" can be adjusted through the high frequencies. Adjust your hi-hat similarly, as they benefit from the same type of EQ treatment. When adjusting the EQ for your bass drum and low toms, roll off some of the high frequencies. This will cause you to lose some of the drums' brightness, but will keep each drum out of the way of each other in the mix and improve the overall sound of your drum set. Do not listen to each channel in solo mode while adjusting the EQ. If you adjust just the snare drum until it sounds perfect, for example, you may find that it sounds terrible when mixed back in with the rest of the drum set. Always adjust EQ with all of the channels playing.  In addition to rolling off the low end of your snare, high toms, and cymbals, consider using a high-pass filter in your mixing software. This will completely remove much of the low frequencies, which will allow the bass drum to occupy this sonic space without being crowded by other channels. This is a better way to improve your bass drum's presence than simply cranking the channel up.  If you are mixing music that includes guitars, pianos, or vocals, your mix will likely already be very crowded between about 250 and 500 hertz. Cutting these frequencies from your drums makes room for other instruments and cleans up the overall sound.   These middle frequencies can be more readily sacrificed on drums than on other instruments like guitars. Drums are chiefly valued in a mix for their high-frequency crack and their low-frequency "oomph."  

examine the tone quality from your overhead mics.  adjust the equalization for each individual mic.  apply a high-pass filter to all channels except the bass drum.  consider cutting some of the middle frequencies from your drum channels. 

 A sphere is a circular solid in three dimensions. The primary formula for the volume of a sphere is:Volume=43πr3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {4}{3}}\pi r^{3}}   π=3.14{\displaystyle \pi =3.14}   r=radius{\displaystyle r={\text{radius}}}   ; , The radius of a sphere is the measure from the center of the sphere to the outer edge. If you are given a problem to calculate volume, you will probably be given the radius. Otherwise, the radius can be difficult to measure because you cannot accurately reach the center of a solid object.Suppose you are told that a sphere exists with a radius of 10 cm. Find the volume as follows:   Volume=43πr3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {4}{3}}\pi r^{3}}   Volume=43∗(3.14)∗103{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {4}{3}}*(3.14)*10^{3}}   Volume=4.18667∗1000{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}=4.18667*1000}   Volume=4186.67cm3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}=4186.67{\text{cm}}^{3}}     , Alternatively, a given situation may provide you with the diameter of a sphere. The diameter is equal to double the radius. In more concrete terms, the diameter is the distance that passes from one edge of the sphere through the center to the opposite edge. To calculate volume beginning with the diameter (d), revise the formula as follows:Volume=43π(d2)3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {4}{3}}\pi ({\frac {d}{2}})^{3}}  As an example of this calculation, find the volume of a sphere whose diameter is 10 cm.   Volume=43π(d2)3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {4}{3}}\pi ({\frac {d}{2}})^{3}}   Volume=43π(102)3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {4}{3}}\pi ({\frac {10}{2}})^{3}}   Volume=43∗(3.14)∗(53){\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {4}{3}}*(3.14)*(5^{3})}   Volume=4.18667∗125{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}=4.18667*125}   Volume=523.3cm3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}=523.3{\text{cm}}^{3}}     , The circumference of a sphere is probably the easiest one for you to measure directly. You can use a tape measure, wrap it carefully around the widest part of the sphere, and take the measurement. Alternatively, you may be provided the circumference in a stated problem. To find the volume beginning with the circumference (C), revise the formula as follows:Volume=43πr3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {4}{3}}\pi r^{3}}   Volume=43π∗(C2π)3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {4}{3}}\pi *({\frac {C}{2\pi }})^{3}}   Volume=43π∗(C38π3){\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {4}{3}}\pi *({\frac {C^{3}}{8\pi ^{3}}})}   Volume=C36π2{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {C^{3}}{6\pi ^{2}}}}   , Suppose you are given a sphere and you measure the circumference to be 32 cm. Find its volume:   Volume=C36π2{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {C^{3}}{6\pi ^{2}}}}   Volume=3236∗3.142{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {32^{3}}{6*3.14^{2}}}}   Volume=32,76859.158{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {32,768}{59.158}}}   Volume=553.9cm3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}=553.9{\text{cm}}^{3}}   , A final, practical method for measuring volume is to submerge the sphere into water. You need to have a beaker large enough to hold the sphere, with accurate volume measurement markings.Pour enough water into the beaker to cover the sphere. Make note of the measurement.  Place the sphere into the water. Notice that the water level rises. Make note of the new measurement.  Subtract the first measurement from the second. The result is the volume of the sphere.  For example, suppose your water level rises from 100 ml to 625 ml when you submerge the sphere. The volume is therefore 525 ml. Note that 1 ml=1 cm3.  To calculate mass from volume, you must know the density of the object. Different materials have different densities. Consider a sphere made of styrofoam, for example, and compare its weight to a sphere the same size made of iron. Iron has a much greater density and will therefore have a greater mass.  You can find densities of many solid materials by looking up density tables online, in textbooks or in other industry catalogs.  For example, here are the recorded densities of some solid materials:Aluminum = 2700 kg/m3  Butter = 870 kg/m3  Lead = 11,350 kg/m3  Pressed wood = 190 kg/m3     , The units you used in calculating volume must match the volume units in the density measurement. If they do not, then you must convert them.  All of the examples in the previous section resulted in volumes measured in cubic centimeters. However, the cited density table provides densities based on cubic meters. Because there are 100 centimeters in a meter, there are 106 cubic centimeters in a cubic meter. Divide the given densities by 106 to represent the density in units of kg/cm3. (You can do this most easily by just moving the decimal point 6 spaces to the left.)  For the four sample materials, the converted densities are as follows:  Aluminum = 2700 kg/m3 = 0.0027 kg/cm3  Butter = 870 kg/m3 = 0.00087 kg/cm3  Lead = 11,350 kg/m3 = 0.01135 kg/cm3  Pressed wood = 190 kg/m3 = 0.00019 kg/cm3     , Recall that the formula for density is Density=MassVolume{\displaystyle {\text{Density}}={\frac {\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}}}}. Rearranging this to find the mass, the equation becomes Density∗Volume=Mass{\displaystyle {\text{Density}}*{\text{Volume}}={\text{Mass}}}.Using the four sample materials, aluminum, butter, lead and pressed wood, find the mass of a sphere that has a volume of 500 cm3.   Aluminum:500 cm3∗0.0027kgcm3=1.35 kg{\displaystyle {\text{Aluminum}}:500{\text{ cm}}^{3}*0.0027{\frac {\text{kg}}{{\text{cm}}^{3}}}=1.35{\text{ kg}}}   Butter:500 cm3∗0.00087kgcm3=0.435 kg{\displaystyle {\text{Butter}}:500{\text{ cm}}^{3}*0.00087{\frac {\text{kg}}{{\text{cm}}^{3}}}=0.435{\text{ kg}}}   Lead:500 cm3∗0.01135kgcm3=5.675 kg{\displaystyle {\text{Lead}}:500{\text{ cm}}^{3}*0.01135{\frac {\text{kg}}{{\text{cm}}^{3}}}=5.675{\text{ kg}}}   Pressed wood:500 cm3∗0.00019kgcm3=0.095 kg{\displaystyle {\text{Pressed wood}}:500{\text{ cm}}^{3}*0.00019{\frac {\text{kg}}{{\text{cm}}^{3}}}=0.095{\text{ kg}}}     , When answering problems about mass calculations, you need to read the full problem carefully. As you read, it may help to highlight the given data. Read the whole problem carefully to see what you are being asked to solve. For example, consider the following problem:   A large sphere made of solid brass has a diameter of 1.2 m. Find the mass of the sphere.  Reading the problem carefully, you should identify that you are given the diameter, so you will use the adjusted formula:   Volume=43π(d2)3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {4}{3}}\pi ({\frac {d}{2}})^{3}}  You should also notice that the sphere is made of brass. You will need to look up the density of brass from a density table online.   From the website, EngineeringToolbox.com, you can find that the density of brass is 8480 kg/m3. Because the diameter of the sphere was given in meters, its volume will be calculated in cubic meters, so you do not need to convert the density.  To calculate the volume, set up the correct formula, fill in the data you know and perform the calculations as follows:   Volume=43π(d2)3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {4}{3}}\pi ({\frac {d}{2}})^{3}}   Volume=43π(1.22)3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\frac {4}{3}}\pi ({\frac {1.2}{2}})^{3}}   Volume=4.18667∗0.63{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}=4.18667*0.6^{3}}   Volume=4.18667∗0.216{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}=4.18667*0.216}   Volume=0.90432 m3{\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}=0.90432{\text{ m}}^{3}}   , Recall that Mass=Density∗Volume{\displaystyle {\text{Mass}}={\text{Density}}*{\text{Volume}}}.Insert the values that you know to find the mass:   Mass=Density∗Volume{\displaystyle {\text{Mass}}={\text{Density}}*{\text{Volume}}}   Mass=8480 kg m3∗0.90432 m3{\displaystyle {\text{Mass}}=8480{\frac {\text{ kg}}{{\text{ m}}^{3}}}*0.90432{\text{ m}}^{3}}   Mass=7668.6 kg{\displaystyle {\text{Mass}}=7668.6{\text{ kg}}}   

recall the formula for a sphere’s volume.  find the volume of a sphere if you know the radius.  find the volume if given the diameter.  revise the formula if you know the circumference.  calculate the volume if you know the circumference.  measure volume by displacement.  find the density.  convert the units as needed.  multiply volume by density to find mass.  read the problem carefully.  identify the known and unknown data.  calculate the volume.  use the density to calculate the mass. 

 Berries that have some of the lowest carb counts include strawberries, raspberries, pokeberry shoots, cranberries, and blackberries. Among this group of low-carb berries, pokeberry shoots have the lowest carbohydrate count (about 1 gram of carbs per quarter-cup), while blackberries have the highest (about 2.7 grams of carbs per quarter-cup)., Other berries that have slightly higher – but still low – carb levels include elderberries, currants, blueberries, and açaí berries. Elderberries and currants have 4 grams of carbs per quarter-cup, while açaí berries have 5 grams of carbs per quarter-cup., These are berries with carb counts of 8 grams of carbs or more. This group includes salmonberries, boysenberries, loganberries, huckleberries, and gooseberries.The berry in this group with the highest carb count is the boysenberry, which packs a whopping 13 grams (0.46 oz) of carbs per quarter-cup. Loganberries, huckleberries, and salmonberries tie for the lowest carb count in this group. Each of these contains 8 grams of carbs per quarter-cup.  

choose a super-low-carb berry.  select berries with mid-range carb levels.  choose berries with higher carb counts. 

 Make sure that your bottoms give you a full range of motion. Be conscious of how much you will sweat during your workout, and think about how hot you're going to get.   Try not to wear shorts that extend more than an inch below your knees – especially if they are loose around the legs. The lower your shorts, the shorter your range of motion., A cotton t-shirt or tank will suffice. Alternately, choose a breathable, sweat-wicking polyester shirt. Pick something that will absorb sweat and that won't restrict your range of motion.A tank will show off your arms, and a t-shirt can be a slightly more modest choice. Decide what you're going for., This can be the most comfortable, most breathable solution. Make sure to read the vibe of the gym before you strip down. There are usually no rules against male shirtlessness – but you may stand out more if you're working out at a smaller gym or if you are the only one shirtless.   Some gyms do have a code against going shirtless. Read the rules beforehand!  , The shoes you wear will depend upon the sort of exercises that you're doing. If you plan to do any cardio, then bring shoes that will offer plenty of protection for your feet and legs.   If you'll be running on a treadmill, then make sure to bring running shoes. If you will be using an elliptical or exercise bike, then your footwear doesn't matter so much – just wear something comfortable that you can stand in. If you'll be training weights, make sure to wear something with ample ankle and arch support. Running shoes are always a good choice.  

wear shorts or sweats.  take a breathable, flexible shirt.  go shirtless, depending on the gym.  choose appropriate footwear. 

 You won’t know how many crates you’ll need to buy or scavenge until you plan out your crate shelf. Think about how many rows of crates wide your shelf will be. Crates can be stacked one on top of the other to add height to a shelf. Keep track of the total number of crates.Same sized crates can be stacked side by side, with additional crates stacked on top to form a bookshelf shape. Singly stacked crates will make a simple bookshelf design.; , Fasten two crates together to form an L-shape. One crate should stand on its end and the other lay flat. Similarly, two other crates can be fastened like a 7. The L and 7 shapes can then be attached at the top and bottom to make a unique shelf with a gap in the middle.It may help you to visualize a design by drawing it out. With a pencil and paper, draw simple boxes to represent crates. Arrange these to your preference.  When trying to think up a neat design, looking at the designs of others can help. Check Pinterest or do an online keyword search for “crate shelves.”Bookmark websites that have designs you like so you can find them easily again. Combine your favorite features into a single design all your own.  Some designs may look good on paper but aren’t safe in reality. If you’re a beginner, you may want to start with a simple bookshelf design, as it is relatively stable.  Most of these supplies can be bought at your local hardware store. Crates are sold at many craft stores, hardware stores, and home centers. Choose sturdy, unfinished, wooden crates. Including the crates, you’ll need:   1-inch (2½ cm) screws Drop cloth (or a similar cover, like newspaper, plastic tablecloth, or an old sheet) L-bracket (x1; to attach the shelf to a wall) Lint-free cloth (x2) Paintbrushes (optional) Power drill (and drill bits) Primer and paint (or wood stain; optional) Sandpaper (medium grit, between 60 and 100 rating) Unfinished wooden crates, Choose a flat, sturdy, level surface, like a work bench. You can create an outdoor workbench by lying a sheet of plywood between two sawhorses. Lay out a drop cloth or similar cover over your work area to catch sawdust and stray paint or wood stain.   Paint and wood stain fumes can build up dangerously in enclosed spaces. Because of this, choose a well-ventilated workspace if you plan to paint or stain your crate shelves., Rub sandpaper in the same direction as the grain of the wood with firm, moderate pressure. When the wood is smooth, sand the next portion. Continue this until all of the crates are smooth.Wipe the crates with a lightly dampened, lint-free cloth to remove sawdust and dirt. Follow this with a dry, clean, lint-free cloth. The grain of the wood is the direction formed by the natural lines in the wood. Follow these natural lines with your sandpaper to achieve the best finish.This process may take an hour or longer depending on the condition of your crates and the total size of the shelf. Speed this process up by using a belt sander or orbital sander.  Prime wood first before painting for the best results. Wood stain can generally be applied directly to clean, sanded wood. For most wood stains, you should wear gloves when applying it to prevent it from staining your skin.Allow painted shelves to dry fully before assembling your shelf. This time will vary depending on the paint or wood stain used. Check the label of your product to determine the drying time. Follow the label instructions on your paint or wood stain to achieve the best results. In many cases, you may need to use several coats to produce an even finish.  Arrange the crates in your planned design. Inspect the crates for stability. When the crates are in place, fasten the crates together with screws. Two screws connecting each crate to its neighbor at its corners should do the trick.Keep the crates steady while fastening them together. Crates screwed in incorrectly will be easily noticeable. Have a friend or family member hold the crates in place as you fasten them.  Apply gentle pressure with your hand to test the balance of the crate shelf. Press on the inner parts of the shelf with gentle pressure. Increase pressure gradually. Add screws to crates that feel like they need more support., Measure the total height of your crate shelf with a tape measure. Mark this height on the wall where the shelf will be positioned. Screw the bracket into the wall so it can fasten the shelf to the wall. Screw the bracket into the top of the shelf.To prevent the shelf from damaging your wall, anchor the L-bracket into a stud. Find studs with a studfinder or other simple techniques. Crate shelves can be somewhat light. If you don’t intend to fill your shelf with heavy items, like books, an L-bracket will keep your shelf from falling over.  Crate shelves that are only a single crate high make excellent shoe storage spaces or as cubbyholes. Make these portable by attaching casters to the bottom four corners of the shelf. This can also be done larger crate shelves, like those shaped like bookshelves.   Casters or similar wheels can be purchased at your local hardware store or home center. These are generally attached by fastening the caster to the wood with screws., Cut a length of fabric 2 in (5 cm) larger than the top of your shelf on all sides. Align the fabric’s edge with a corresponding outer edge of the crate. Attach the fabric along the edge with staples. Repeat this along three of the four sides. Stuff cotton into the cover through the open edge. Staple this edge closed when enough stuffing has been added.   Check your crates for sturdiness before adding a comfortable fabric cover. The crate should easily support the weight of a normal person., Cut a piece of plywood to fit inside your crate and insert it to create dividers. Use wooden planks to make slatted dividers. Fasten dividers in place by screwing them into the crate at the top and bottom., 

plan a simple bookshelf design.  create shelves with a gap in the center.  look for inspiration for crate shelf designs online.  keep shelf sturdiness in mind when planning your shelf.  gather your supplies.  ready your work area.  sand the crates.  paint or stain the crates, if desired.  screw the shelf together.  test for stability and reinforce the shelf with screws, if necessary.  attach the shelf to a wall with an l-bracket for added stability.  attach casters for a rolling shelf.  cover low, sturdy shelves with fabric to make a seat.  make compartments in your shelf with dividers.  finished.  

 The item should be no larger than your thumb. Flat items are best, but you can use a slightly-raised item, such as a button or cabochon. Here are some items that make great pins:   Cabochons Decorative buttons (such as coat buttons) Embroidered patches Metal bottle caps Wooden shapes  , Soak a cotton ball or tissue with rubbing alcohol and run it across the back of the item. This will get rid of any oils or dirt that might prevent the glue from sticking properly.  When you place the safety pin behind your found object, you should not see it sticking out.  You can use hot glue, but super glue or epoxy glue will work even better.  Flip the object over, so that the back is facing you. Quickly press the safety pin onto the back. Try to align it horizontally, and make it as centered as possible.  If you are using hot glue, this will only take a few minutes. If you are using super glue or epoxy glue, this may take several hours.  

find something small, light, and with a flat back.  wipe the back of the object with rubbing alcohol.  find a flat backed safety pin that is a little bit narrower than your item.  draw a line of glue along the back of the pin.  press the back of the safety pin into the glue.  let the glue set before you use it. 

,, Then add the cream. To add, pour it over the back of a spoon––doing this ensures that the cream remains on the surface of the coffee.  In case guests want to know, inform them that this coffee is meant to be left alone and drunk through the layer of cream, rather than mixed in.  

place the sugar and irish whiskey into a warm, tall stemmed glass.  ,  fill the glass two thirds full with the hot coffee.  ,  stir briefly.  serve. 

 The easiest way to jazz up your jeans is to find fun pins and buttons, and simply pin them on. Because it's not permanent, you can mix and match which ones you wear every day.; ,   Pick the one that's right for you. Iron-on patches and appliques are faster to apply, and great if you don't have much experience sewing. Choose a location. Flat or simple designs are great for back pockets. Elaborate ones that have sequins or delicate embellishments fare better down the sides of the leg.  Craft stores sell a wide variety of kits that supply everything you'll need, including design idea booklets.   Be safe when using hot glue applicators. If you've chosen to add crystals to your jeans, read the glue gun instructions carefully. Mark your studs beforehand. Attaching studs creates small holes in the fabric. Be certain where you want your studs before using the tools.  If you have experience sewing, add a few designs to the seams, belt loops or a pocket.    "Distress" the denim with sandpaper. Sand down the jeans on the front thighs and knees. The courser the paper, the rougher the "distress." "Destroy" your jeans by scraping at the knee until a little hole appears. If desired, make the hole bigger by ripping it open with your hands. Use a knife or your fingers to pull the strings out, so they hang down.  Faded jeans can be updated to a dark wash look by dying them a darker blue. Black jeans never go out of style. Strategically splashed bleach can add to the "destroyed" look.  With careful pre-measuring, you can change boot cut to straight leg, straight leg to tapered, or even lower the rise.  

add flare with buttons and pins.  add patches or appliques.  bejewel with studs or crystals.  embroider your jeans.  created "destroyed" or "distressed" jeans.  use dye or bleach.  alter the fit using a sewing machine. 

 A diffuser is an attachment for your hairdryer which helps keep curls intact by reducing the pulling and straightening effect of regular blow drying. Long-finger diffusers usually have a bowl or cup for the air to sit in while drying, this allows for less movement and produces less frizz.  When using a diffuser, you should always set your hair dryer's heat and speed settings to low. The low heat protects your hair from burning while your hair is sitting in the cup of the diffuser, close to the heat source. The low speed minimizes air movement, thus preventing frizz.  Turn the hair dryer on and direct the flow of air upwards, to help lift the roots. Take a section and scrunch the hair up towards the scalp, holding it there with the fingers of the diffuser until the hair is dry. Rotate the diffuser in a slight circular motion. Move on to another section of hair and repeat, until all of your hair is dry. Don't forget to turn your head upside down to dry the underside.  Once all of your hair is dry, you can spritz it with some hairspray to hold the curls in place, or work in a dime-sized amount of gel to help give the curls some definition. 

attach a long-finger diffuser to your hair dryer.  turn the hair dryer's speed and heat settings to low.  dry your hair.  apply some hairspray or gel.  finished.  

 T-shirts are also coated with a starchy material to help them lay more smoothly in the store. This starchy material can prevent paint from sticking.  This will keep the spray paint from bleeding onto the back of the shirt. The newspaper or cardboard should be big enough to fit inside the shirt without stretching it. Be sure to smooth out any wrinkles of ripples., You can use a stencil meant for fabric painting, or a regular stencil. You can also make your own out of thin plastic, freezer paper, or cardstock. You can even use painter's tape to create chevron stripes! Make sure that the stencil is laying flat against the fabric. If it isn't, the paint will seep under the edges and create a blurred design.   If you are using a fabric painting stencil, it will probably have a sticky back. Simply press it onto the shirt and smooth it down. If you are using a regular stencil, or if you made your own, spray the back of the stencil with repositionable adhesive spray, then press it down onto the shirt. If you are using freezer paper, simply place the stencil shiny-side-down onto the shirt, then run a clothing iron over it.  Ideally, you should work outside, but if you can't, a large room with lots of open windows might do. Cover your work area with lots of newspaper, and put on some old clothes or an apron. Lastly, consider putting on a pair of plastic gloves; spray painting can get messy.If you are working indoors and start to feel lightheaded, take a break and go outside for some fresh air.  Shake the can for 30 to 60 seconds first, then hold it 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the stencil. Spray the paint on using a long, sweeping motion. Don't worry if the paint is not thick enough. You can always do another layer or two.   Consider spraying the design using clear sealer first. This will give you better control over the paint and prevent it from soaking into the fabric. Be sure to let the sealer dry before applying the paint., Once the paint is dry, spray on a second coat; you should see the paint going on thicker now. If you'd like, you can do a partial layer instead using a different color for a tie-dye effect.  Be very careful when removing the stencil, as some of the paint might still be wet, especially towards the edges.Unlike with fabric paint, you can let spray paint dry before removing the stencil. This is because spray paint doesn't form a thick layer that might tear—like fabric paint does. 

wash your t-shirt to remove any shrinking.even if your shirt says "pre-shrunk" on it, it would still be a good idea to wash it.  tuck a folded up newspaper or cardboard inside the shirt.  position your stencil, and secure, if necessary.  move to a well-ventilated area and get set up.  spray the shirt.  let the paint dry for 15 minutes before doing a second coat.you can speed up the drying process with a hairdryer.  let the paint dry for another 10 to 15 minutes before removing the stencil and newspaper/cardboard.  let the shirt finish drying for a few more minutes.once the shirt is dry, you can pull the cardboard out and wear your shirt.

 Easily the most popular beer style to brew with berries is hefeweizen. The mild, yeasty flavor of this wheat-based beer make it the ideal backdrop for the bright, sweet flavor of blackberries. Other wheat styles, such as Belgian whites, also work well.; , Blackberries also work well in rich, roasted beer styles like porter and stout. The smoky, chocolate flavors of these beers pair effortlessly with fresh berries, just as you might combine these flavors in a dessert.  Note that adding fruit to a beer will impair its visual clarity, which is another reason why thick, cloudy hefeweizens and stouts make good pairings. Adding blackberries to a crystal clear pilsner, for example, will mar its appearance.  

consider brewing a blackberry wheat beer.  introduce blackberries into a porter or stout recipe.  avoid adding berries to very clear beers. 

 Set the emergency brake and release the hood by pulling the lever located at the far left side of the driver’s footwell.  Check to ensure the headlights and the key switch are both off.; , Open the hood by inserting your hand in the gap between hood and grill. Locate the lever assembly, and slide leftward slightly. You should be able to lift the hood fully upward.,, Rotate the headlamp retainer pins until they are free of the headlamp housing.  If the pins are difficult to dislodge from road dirt, the flat blade screwdriver may be useful. Insert between headlight housing and pin, and twist gently to dislodge pin.  Make sure to note which location the pin came from, as they are not interchangeable.,   Do not pull quickly. There is a wiring harness connected to the back that is easily damaged.   This can be difficult; sometimes it can be useful to set the housing on a stand while you do this.   Ensure the surface you are working on is soft enough to not mar the headlamp surface. ,,  Do not touch the glass part of the bulb with your fingers. The oil on your fingers will cause the bulb to prematurely fail. Handle bulb with clean gloves only. ,,  You should hear an audible “click” as the connector fully seats. Tug slightly on the connection to ensure the harness is connected fully.  Make sure you haven’t trapped or pinched any wires. Try to loosely line up the pin holes.  If it doesn’t seem to be lining up, take two steps back and look at it. You should be able to see what side isn’t correct.  Make sure they are in the same position they came from.  If you have them mixed up, shorter one goes closer to center of vehicle. , Turn headlamps on, and return to front of vehicle.,, 

ensure your vehicle is parked on a level surface in a well-lit area.  move to the front of the vehicle.locate headlamp assembly that is defective.  locate two (2) dowel pins on top of the headlamp assembly.  pull headlight retainer pins straight up, and gently set aside in a safe location.  grasp headlight assembly and pull gently towards you.  while holding the headlamp housing, disconnect the harness from the bulbs by squeezing the connector and pulling it straight away from the bulb.  take the headlamp housing, now free of wiring harness, to a workbench or some stable surface.remove the old bulbs, by grasping the bulb and twisting counterclockwise 90 degrees.safely dispose of the old bulbs in an approved location.  take your new bulb out of the packaging.install the bulb by inserting into headlight housing and twisting clockwise 90 degrees.return to vehicle with housing.  reconnect harness to new bulbs.  loosely place the housing to the vehicle.  reinsert pins through vehicle body and headlight housing.rotate pins until they lock under tab in headlight housing.  get into vehicle, turn switch to on but don't yet start the vehicle.check for light function, and shut the hood.turn off headlamps, and turn key switch to off position. 

 Look at the online classifieds or the classifieds in the paper for any part-time jobs in your area. If you are currently going to school, you should look for an after school job at a store or restaurant close by that you can get to easily. Negotiate your hours with your employer to make sure you have enough time for your schoolwork.Make sure your resume for the part-time job showcases your skills and your education. If the position involves serving customers, you should highlight your strong communication skills and your ability to think quickly on your feet. If the position focuses more on processing and arranging items or data, you should include a note about your strong organizational skills.  Another way to get some part-time income is to offer to do odd jobs for your neighbors for payment. This could include mowing lawns, shoveling snow, cleaning houses, or repairing broken items.You could also start a part-time service where you mow lawns once a week for a set rate or deliver papers in the neighborhood once a week for payment. This will allow you to have a stable part-time income and be able to pay for items yourself, rather than having to rely on your parents for money.  Help your parents save money by contributing to the household expenses using your earnings from the part-time job. Offer to put half of your earnings towards expenses for yourself and for maintaining your household.You should put the other half of your earnings in a savings account so you can also save money to pay for things you may need later, like school supplies or clothing. You can also use your savings to prepare for the cost of post secondary education.  Help your parents make some extra income to contribute to their budget by suggesting a garage sale or an online sale of unneeded household items. This could be the pile of sports gear gathering dust in the garage or old childhood items in the basement. Consider any items you or your parents have not used in at least one to two years and if it has any monetary value. You should work together with your parents to identify items that can be resold.   You may want to hold a garage sale for items that are lesser value or that you may sell for $10-$20. You can then try to sell more expensive items or items worth more money online via online selling sites and advertising.  You can also cut down on your parents' spending by searching for sales and deals on basic necessities like groceries and household items. You should encourage your parents to take advantage of sale items and discounted items when they buy things for the house or for you.   Depending on how old your parents are, they may also qualify for senior discounts on items and services. Most senior discounts start at age 65 and up. If your parents fall into a senior age range, they may be able to take advantage of senior discount rates.  

apply for part-time jobs in your area.  ask your neighbors for payment to do odd jobs.  put half of your earnings towards your parents’ expenses.  suggest a garage sale or selling unneeded household items online.  look for discount sales and benefits for your parents. 

 The thin skin around each peanut isn't harmful — in fact, some people prefer leaving it on to eating "naked" nuts. However, if you wish, you can remove the skins easily with a salad spinner. Roll the roasted peanuts in your hands over an open salad spinner, letting them gradually fall out and into the device. Once you've rolled all of the peanuts, close the spinner and run it until most (if not all) of the skins have been separated. You may need to peel a few skins off by hand.Here's another method for skinning peanuts: first, place the roasted peanuts in a jar or container and shake them or wrap them in a clean dish towel and rub them. Pour the peanuts out, then take the jar, container, or towel outside and let the wind blow away the loose skins.  You only need a little seasoning to make natural, roasted peanuts even more delicious. There's no "right answer" here, but just a few seasoning suggestions are included below:   A light dusting of brown sugar and cinnamon makes a delicious sweet treat. Combining Cajun seasoning mix with a little salt makes for intensely flavorful peanuts. Cayenne powder, garlic powder, and smoked paprika can give you red-hot Southwestern-style peanuts., Liquid flavorings can be used as glazes to give the peanuts intense, alluring flavors. However, for best results, these should be applied before the roasting process. Paint the prepared peanuts with a thin layer of your glaze and roast them as normal to give them the glaze's flavor. Since you're using liquid ingredients here, lining your pan with foil or baking paper is a wise idea.   Here, again, there are hundreds of possibilities. One easy classic example is honey-roasted peanuts. To make the glaze, just combine equal parts honey and melted butter and stir until uniform. About two tablespoons of each ingredient should be enough for a pound of peanuts. Paint the peanuts with the glaze and sprinkle with salt before they go into the oven. Roast as normal., Believe it or not, making all-natural peanut butter from (shelled) peanuts is as simple as crushing, chopping, or grinding them into a thick but smooth paste. See our peanut butter recipe for step-by-step directions. As noted above, Spanish peanuts are best for this as they contain the most oil. You can use a food processor, a blender, or a manual solution like a mortar and pestle to get the peanuts to a smooth, creamy consistency.   For chunky peanut butter, chop up a handful of peanuts and add them to the finished peanut butter. Some chefs like to add a dash of honey, molasses, salt, or other seasonings to their peanut butter for flavor. However, it should be fine on its own.  

try skinning shelled peanuts.  use creative seasonings.  make glazed peanuts.  grind your roasted peanuts to make peanut butter. 

 If you are starting at the beginning of the school year, this means that you absolutely must do your summer reading. Even if you could get by without doing it at your old school, your new school might test you on it right away. Although summer reading isn't always the most fun thing in the world, it's much easier to tackle that summer reading assignment if you do your reading ahead of time. At the very least, you won't have a clueless look on your face when your teacher asks about the summer reading or math assignments.; , If you have to attend a new student orientation where teachers are present, be sure to ask about what's expected from you academically.  Even if you are an A+ student, neglecting your studies result in that horrible 64, or D- on that reading assignment you could've easily avoided had you studied. Try to study in a quiet area where you can concentrate and can't be disturbed.  It may take more work to get an A at your new school than it did at your old one. Take their feedback seriously and use it to improve your work.  Some schools expect you to be a more active participant and encourage students to ask more questions. In that case, try to match the participation level of your classmates. Even if it is uncomfortable at first, your teachers will respect you for making an effort. At the very least, try to raise your hand for something other than asking to go to the bathroom.  Some schools, especially smaller private ones, have teachers who will grade you on your homework. You don't want to lose points for not doing homework or doing it poorly. At the very least, doing your homework will give you a better understanding of the material, it will give you a sense of what you need to improve on and you won't get in trouble.  Some teachers are big fans of pop quizzes and as the new student, you won't have a sense of who they are. It helps to do as much preparation as you can.  Behave well toward everyone -- even to that jerk who tripped you and made you land flat on your plate of beans at lunchtime. Do as Hiawatha did in the Native American days and be nice to everyone, even your enemies. Doing this will make you new friends, which means more fun for you!  , It can make you look like an idiot in front of your friends, crush, or teacher. It can also get you in big trouble.  This is easier to do if you avoid hanging out with people who make you feel uncomfortable or who just don't like. Give yourself some leeway to make mistakes, but be sure to learn from each and every one.  

make sure you complete any assignments you are expected to do prior to starting school.  try to meet with your teachers or school administrators ahead of time.  study hard.  listen to your teachers.  gauge the level of participation expected.  do every homework assignment.  keep up with the reading and go over your notes.  be a good influence.  don't cuss.  be good in general. 

 A two-bag bomb bag is a quick and basic way to make an effective bomb bag. To begin, place one tablespoon (14.78 ml) of baking soda in a Ziploc sandwich bag or a similar small, completely sealable bag., After adding the baking soda to the larger sandwich bag, pour ¼ cup (59.14 ml) of vinegar to a smaller sealable bag like a snack size Ziploc bag. Then seal the zip on the bag completely.Make sure that the snack size bag in which you put the vinegar is smaller than the bag that you put the baking soda in. Leave a little bit of air inside the snack bag of vinegar, as opposed to pressing it before sealing and letting the air escape. You need to initially separate the vinegar and baking soda because they react almost instantly, which means that if you poured them in together, you wouldn’t have time to seal the bag before the pressure builds. Adding them in separately ensures that the reaction in the bag will be able to build up to an explosion.  Once you seal the snack bag, place the snack bag of vinegar inside the larger bag of baking soda. Seal the zip on the sandwich bag., Once you seal the larger bag, place the bag on a surface that is either outside or can be easily cleaned. Then hit or punch the snack bag inside the sandwich bag. Because you left some air inside the snack bag, the pressure of your punch should open up the seal of the bag slightly to let the vinegar escape into the larger sandwich bag.If punching the bag doesn’t partially open the seal, use your fingers to try to pinch the sides of the snack bag of vinegar and pull the seal partially open without opening the larger sandwich bag.  Once you have partially opened the seal of the snack bag of vinegar, give the bag a good shake to allow some of the vinegar to escape into the larger, sealed sandwich bag of baking soda. Once you have jiggled the bag and see the vinegar touch the baking soda, toss the bag down onto an easily cleanable surface., After shaking the bag, the vinegar will collide with the baking soda, and you should see the reaction start and the bag start to expand. When the bag has expanded to its fullest extent, it will explode with a loud pop! 

add a tablespoon (14.78 ml) of baking soda to a sandwich bag.  add ¼ cup (59.14 ml) of vinegar to a snack bag.  place the snack bag inside the sandwich bag.  punch the snack bag to release the vinegar.  jiggle the bag and toss it down.  watch the explosion. 

 Assuming you already have an anti-virus set up, you can launch the software by accessing the system tray icon at the lower-right corner for Windows, or the upper-right corner for Mac.   Click the up arrow icon next to the system clock on Windows. This should open the tray icon list. Click on the icon of your respective anti-virus program to launch the UI. For Mac users, you can click the anti-virus icon on the upper-right corner to launch it.; , Once the anti-virus user interface has opened, you will see a menu that lets you select the tools to use along either the left or right side of the screen.  This usually resembles a magnifying glass or any icon related to searching.  At this point, your anti-virus will let you choose what sort of scan you want it to perform:   You can opt for a “Quick scan,” which usually takes a short amount of time and is less thorough but generally gets the job done. If you want a more thorough scan, you can choose “Complete scan” to really let the program take its time to look for threats.  After you’ve selected the scan option, click “Start” to begin scanning for viruses.  Most anti-viruses will provide you a list of potential and actual threats either in real time or after the scan has completed.  Once your software has finished the scan, it will let you decide what to do with the threats. Look through the list it provides you, and see if it falsely detected a program that you know for sure is not a virus.   False detection can sometimes occur with programs that do processes that normal programs don’t normally do. It is called a false positive when this occurs.  Right-click the false positives and choose to add it to the anti-virus exceptions from the options.  Now that the false positives have been added as exceptions, you can now choose to either delete the rest of the threats or move them to a virus vault.   In the virus vault, the threats are isolated, and will not be able to access your computer’s files so they cannot do any harm.  This is to finalize the threat removal. 

locate your anti-virus software.  view the anti-virus interface.  click the scan tool.  select a scan option.  start scanning for viruses.  wait for the anti-virus to finish scanning.  check for false detection.  add the false detection to the exceptions.  delete real threats.  restart your computer. 

 Paper shredders come in a variety of shapes, sizes and qualities. In general, the most effective shredders are usually those with the higher price tags. These also tend to be able to shred a higher volume of paper more efficiently. Which shredder you choose entirely depends on your needs. Any office supply store will carry a range of shredders for both home and office use.If you are shredding large amounts of paper, get the best shredder that you can afford. Low priced shredders tend to only allow you to shred one or two documents at a time, feeding them in slowly by hand. If you have a lot of paper to shred, this could take a very long time. If you are shredding documents with highly private or sensitive information, don’t opt for the cheapest shredder solution. A mid-priced home or office shredder is your best bet. This is because the cheaper the shredder, the less effective the shredding mechanism actually is. It may shred in fairly large strips; you’d want to get something higher quality to destroy your sensitive documents.; , If you don’t want to invest in a shredder, or if the amount you have to shred is very large, there are companies that specialize in document disposal.The cost is relatively low, and it’s common for these businesses to allow you to watch your documents being shredded, for your own peace of mind.   Do a quick Google search for your local document destruction agencies – in most cities, you’ll have multiple options and a range of prices and services. Choose what suits your situation best. In many cases, document disposal agencies will come to you and shred on-site. This is an especially popular choice for small businesses and those in a corporate setting. If you are disposing of paper on a regular basis, document destruction agencies offer regularly scheduled services. Most of these companies will provide you with a Certificate of Destruction after each service, providing you with even more peace of mind. If privacy protection is your main motivation for disposing of paper, don’t forget to consider any old hard drives you might have in your home or office. Many of these companies also offer destruction services for a variety of media.  Follow the instruction manual carefully. Shredders can jam up very easily if you try to pass through too many documents at once.   Check the volume your shredder can handle. Smaller machines can only shred around 5 documents at one time. Bigger machines can handle a lot more. Be sure not to exceed your machine’s shredding capacity. Also check your machine’s manual for items that shouldn’t be shredded. Some of the smaller home machines will jam if you try to shred an envelope with a plastic window. Other machines can easily shred plastic windows, staples, paper clips and even credit cards.If you do exceed capacity or shred the wrong item and end up with a paper jam, all standard machines are equipped with a reverse mode that allows you to remove the jam easily. After you are finished with your shredding, don’t forget to turn the machine off. Leaving it on for excessive amounts of time can overheat its motor. Shredders need to be oiled on a regular basis to keep them working optimally.Many machines provide a small bottle of this when you purchase it. If yours didn’t, you can easily pick this up at any office supply store. To oil the machine, drizzle a small amount of the lubricant through the machine’s feed opening and run your shredder in reverse mode for about 60 seconds. Then switch it back to normal mode and pass a few papers through to absorb any excess oil.  You probably only want to do this if you have a relatively small amount of paper to dispose of, as this method can be rather time-consuming. It’s generally not a recommended way to dispose of documents that contain sensitive information. If you do choose this method, make sure you do tear the paper into very small pieces.   Tear the paper into six to eight vertical strips. Then take those strips and tear them into pieces no larger than one inch. Anything larger will be a security risk. After you complete your task, store the paper in a bag somewhere safe, such as a locked closet or office, until you can recycle it.  After paper is shredded, it is still viable for recycling and there is no security risk in doing this.If the amount of shredded material will fit into your home recycling bin, its fine to put it in there. If you have a large volume of shredded material, it’s better to take it to a recycling agency yourself.  

buy a paper shredder.  investigate document destruction services.  shred the paper using a shredder.  shred the paper by hand.  recycle the shredded material.

 Exotic plants offer some really great architectural elements to the garden. When planning your garden, think about using some tall, striking plants such as Gunnera, Dicksonia Antarctica (which grows up to 3m in height) or Cordyline, that add both height and texture to the garden.; , A mix of colors and textures is often particularly successful in an exotic garden. For example, try mixing green spiky plants such as Agave together with softer textured silver or blue grasses, and the striking red flowers of Bromeliad or Hibiscus.  Add some mid-height plants such as Colocasia and Strelitzia (Bird of Paradise), as well as smaller lower-growing ones such as small Aloes. A few climbers such as Passionflower, Kiwi or Hedera will soften the look of the garden over time.  Exotic plants will be complemented by plants that aren’t strictly exotic, but look as if they could be. Examples include Japanese Painted Ferns or Sweet Potato Vine.  Remember to include evergreens for year-round interest, or your garden will look very bare over the winter months. Fatsia japonica or bamboo will provide year-round color and interest.  Exotic plants will generally do better in a sunny, sheltered spot with rich well-drained soil. However, no matter how sheltered or sunny your garden is, it’s important to keep in mind that many varieties of exotic plants will need protection over the winter months.  When you design your garden, it’s important to think about how you are going to overwinter your plants, or if you plan on overwintering them at all.   If you are growing Begonias, either treat them as annual plants (which live for one year only) or be prepared to bring them inside over the winter. Plants such as Hibiscus or Bougainvillea will want to go into a greenhouse or conservatory for the coldest months of the year. If you have limited space indoors, either be prepared to replace these plants every year or grow fewer of them.  Mature banana plants and some species of palm can survive the winter outdoors in a sheltered position if wrapped up with something like rush screening or special plant wrapping fleece.   Design your garden so you can easily access these plants to wrap them when required. This means you should avoid planting underfoot so you don’t have to tread on other plants to access the plants that need wrapping. You’ll also need access to all sides of the plant in order to wrap it up, so don’t plant it tight into a corner. Once wrapped, the plant won’t be very attractive. Putting fairy lights inside the wrap can help raise the temperature inside on cold nights and also make it look more attractive.  Young versions of palm and banana plants should be moved inside a greenhouse over the winter. If they are large and heavy, consider planting in large planters with trolley wheels attached. This makes it much easier to move them.  Some exotic plants such as Bougainvilla and Passionflower will survive a mild winter outside from zones 8B and up. Consider making these hardier exotics the backbone of your garden.   This will minimize the work you need to do in the fall to prepare the garden for winter and help to keep your garden from looking completely desolate over the winter months. The term "zones" refers the USDA plant hardiness scale, which divides the USA into 11 planting zones, according to their average annual minimum winter temperature. Find out which zone you live in by going to the National Gardening Association website and entering your zip code.  Plants such as Caladium or Canna that grow from tubers or bulbs will benefit from being lifted and overwintered indoors. The bulbs or tubers can then be replanted outdoors again in spring.   Make sure you can easily access these plants to dig them up at the right time, or plant them in containers so you can locate them quickly and move them inside before winter.  It’s important to remember that many tropical plants are poisonous and some, such as Caladium, can irritate the skin.   If you are concerned about children or animals eating or touching the plants, consider adding fencing to restrict their access, or choose plant varieties you know to be non-toxic.  Avoid planting spiky plants close to seating areas or walkways, as these may catch in your clothing and cause a tear.   Additionally, children may cut or prick their fingers by grabbing onto sharp or prickly leaves.  Plants that drop their leaves, flowers or fruit may be annoying if planted over decking or walkways as they can make the surface slippery and require regular cleaning up.  

use a number of tall, striking plants.  plan on having a mixture of colors and textures.  add some mid-height and low growing plants.  consider including some interesting indigenous plants.  remember to include some evergreen plants to add interest year-round.  choose a sunny, sheltered, well-draining spot for your exotic plants.  think about how you intend to overwinter your plants.  wrap mature banana plants and certain species of palm over the winter.  move young banana plants and palm trees indoors over the winter.  plant a selection of hardier exotic plants to keep your garden interesting over the winter.  lift delicate tubers or bulbs and bring them indoors over the winter.  take precautions when planting poisonous exotic plants.  avoid planting prickly or spiky plants near benches or walkways.  don’t put shedding plants over decking or walkways. 

 Add your apple cider vinegar, ground mustard, salt, and aquafaba to a small bowl. Blend them together with an immersion blender until they’re evenly mixed. This should only take a second or two., Once the other ingredients are mixed, keep the immersion blender running. Very slowly pour in ¼ cup (59 ml) of your oil while mixing it in with blender as you pour. The oil will cause the mixture to thicken, which means you’ll have to move the blender around more and more to cover it all, so pause between each ¼ cup to blend and judge the mixture’s consistency before repeating.You only need enough oil to thicken the mixture so it isn’t runny. If it doesn’t drip or pour off the blender when you remove it after the third 1/4 cup, stop there. If it still appears running, add another 1/4 cup.  Pour the mixture into a jar with an airtight seal. Place the jar in the refrigerator. Give it a few hours to thicken, until it reaches the consistency of real mayo. Once it does, use it as a spread for sandwiches, a dip for french fries, or as needed in any recipe that calls for mayo.Once a can of chickpeas is opened, the aquafaba will last for one week when refrigerated, so adjust the recipe's proportions if needed to make an amount you're likely to use up in that time. 

blend together all but the oil.  add the oil.  refrigerate.

; , When do you expect the borrower to pay you back? If multiple payments will be made, agree on specific dates for the payments.  Especially if you're lending money to a friend or family member, it may seem a little extortionate to charge interest. But there are several good reasons why you may want to charge the person you're giving money to a little bit of interest:   If you're giving away money without interest, you're losing money. You're losing purchasing power (the ability to buy and invest with the money you're lending) and inflation is outstripping your money. If you charge someone interest, the borrower may be more likely to pay you back quicker than had you not. Think about it: Interest lasts as long as the life of the loan, so if the borrower holds on to the money longer, they'll end up paying more interest. Don't charge more than 15% or 20%. In fact, interest rates above 15% or 20% might not even be allowed under predatory lending laws.So keep the interest rate at something manageable and both parties will be happy.  Include your signature along with your legal name.  Have them put down a signature along with a legal name.  A witness might be able to prove a binding verbal contract took place.  

include the date and the amount being borrowed, or the amount agreed on for the service or product.how much did you loan out?,  include a due date for return of the funds.  include how much interest you will charge.  sign the document yourself.  make sure the other party signs the document.  if possible, have a witness (optional).although a witness does not make or break the iou, it's helpful if you ever need to go to court. 

 Whisk the buttermilk together with the Italian seasoning, paprika, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper in a small dish until well combined.  If you do not have an Italian seasoning blend, you could substitute 1/2 cup mixed and chopped fresh herbs. Use herbs like oregano, thyme, and parsley.  Place the rabbit pieces in the spiced buttermilk and turn to coat all sides. Cover and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.  A longer marinating time means a stronger flavor and more tender meat.  Bring the oil to temperature over medium-high heat. Ideally, the oil should be heated to a temperature around 325 degrees Fahrenheit (160 degrees Celsius).  Check the temperature of the oil using a candy thermometer. Note that you may need to continually check the temperature of the oil during the cooking process to make sure that it does not get too cool or too hot. Do not let the oil smoke at any point during the cooking process. If you do not have a candy thermometer, test the oil by quickly sprinkling flour into it. The flour should sizzle upon contact. A large cast iron frying pan is the ideal type of pan to use. Keep in mind that once you add the rabbit pieces, the oil should reach roughly the halfway point up along the side of the pieces.  Place the rabbit pieces in a colander and let the buttermilk drain from it naturally for a couple of minutes.  Do not shake the buttermilk off or try to wipe the excess away. Simply allow the excess to drip off via the assistance of gravity.  Mix the flour and salt in a large plastic bag, shaking until well combined. Place a few pieces into the bag and shake well to coat all sides., Fry for 12 to 15 minutes at a steady sizzle. Turn using tongs and fry for another 10 to 15 minutes.  The rabbit should fry at a gentle sizzle. It should not be violent, but it should do more than merely sit in the oil. Remove all the pieces separately as they turn crispy and golden brown. The belly flap pieces and forelegs will finish up first. The loin will be next, and the hind legs will be last. If you need to fry the rabbit pieces in batches, let them drain in the colander as they wait. Only flour the rabbit pieces immediately before you intend to fry them.  Transfer the rabbit pieces to layers of clean paper towels or brown paper bags. Let drain for a few minutes before serving, and serve the pieces hot or at room temperature. 

mix the buttermilk and the spices.  marinate the rabbit pieces.  pour the oil in a large heavy-bottomed pan and let it heat up.  drain the rabbit.  dredge the rabbit in the flour mixture.  fry for 22 to 30 minutes, turning once.  drain and serve. 

 Start your moving process by getting rid of the items that you don't need. There's no sense in organizing and trying to pack a bunch of stuff that you'll just get rid of anyway, so pick through your home meticulously and get rid of as much as you can. Go room by room and look for items that you haven't used at all in the last year. Chances are, if more than a year goes by without use, you probably don't need the item.   Everyone has sentimental knickknacks and old papers that they don't want to get rid of. That's fine. But a healthy practice is to keep a small or medium size box that's devoted to these items. Keep only what you can fit in the box. If you want to put in things that are new, you have to empty out things that don't matter to you quite as much any more. This practice will keep you from hoarding items.; , Next you'll want to get some boxes to pack items in to. You might want to use plastic bins for some items, like papers and clothes, which are sensitive to water and staining. This will keep them from getting damaged. For most other items however, cardboard boxes are the way to go. Use mainly small and medium size boxes and pack them no heavier than 50 lbs.   You can often buy cheap cardboard boxes from auto shops and hardware stores. Avoid the boxes sold by moving companies, as they are often more expensive. You can also get boxes for free, although they might not be in as good condition. Go to grocery stores, wholesale stores, large cafeterias or restaurants, and liquor stores and ask if they have any boxes you can have for moving. Since they have to take the cardboard to the recycling anyway, they're usually happy to give the boxes away. Liquor store boxes are best for moving, since they're designed to carry very heavy items without breaking.  You will want to rent a few items from your local hardware store or moving company, in order to make this process easier and less back-breaking. Mainly, you'll want a hand truck and possibly a dolly. These will help you transport very heavy items and more than one item at once, speeding up the process and making it easier on your body.   Of course, you'll want other items too. Tape, shrink wrap, pens for labeling, scissors, box cutters, twine and cords are all very useful for packing and moving.  Make a separate box or bag with all the things that you'll need for the first few days after moving. Put things inside like a few changes of clothes, your toiletries, a roll of toilet paper, a few plates and utensils, and maybe a frying pan. This will save you from having to dig through a bunch of boxes right away to get at the things you need most.   Remember to tape the lids closed on liquid items and wrap them in bags. You don't want all of your immediately needed items to be covered in shampoo.  For items that are really important, like all of your moving documents and important documents like birth certificates, you will want to have a separate box or bag. You should also put very expensive items in this box, like your mp3 player and your grandmother's jewelry. This box should be transported in your car with you or on your person.   If you're moving very far, it might be a good idea to have this box shipped ahead of you. Send it to your new home if someone is waiting there to receive it or have it shipped to someone you trust.  Now that you've got all that done, you can start going through the rest of the items in your home. Go room by room and try to keep similar items together. Place heavier items at the bottom of boxes and try to evenly distribute the weight between boxes. Make sure the box is full and if it's not, fill it with packing paper. If the top of the box has nothing below it, it will be more prone to collapsing, which can break the items in your box. As you pack, be sure to label everything clearly.   Make an inventory list as you go, numbering the boxes and indicating which important items are in which boxes (as well as how many boxes there are). You can also use color-coded tape to indicate which room boxes belong in, for example making all boxes for the living room green and all boxes for the kitchen yellow.  You're probably acquainted with the idea of wrapping delicate items in newspaper or bubble wrap. These are both very good practices and you should definitely wrap items which are prone to breaking. However, you should consider also using non traditional items, since sometimes these can be doubled up to save you packing space.   For example, wrap your glasses in pairs of clean socks and your picture frames can be wrapped in towels. You should also remember to wrap items to support them. Items with holes at the center or long arms should be wrapped to give them support and make them look more like solid objects. This will keep them from getting broken. Make sure any boxes that do contain delicate items are marked as fragile. This will help you decide how to organize boxes in the truck and keep you from accidentally breaking items.  Look for any place where there is empty space and use it for packing space. This can reduce the overall footprint of your move, saving you money on trucks or containers. Large furniture items are usually the best example of spaces that can be multipurpose.   For example, you can stuff linens in your fridge. Your dresser drawers can filled with rolled up clothes and saran wrapped individually. Since the drawers are best carried in to your new home one at a time anyway, you can use the space so that the dresser space isn't wasted when it's in the truck.  Most importantly, you're going to want to stay focused and motivated. Even the most fastidious packer can move at a snail's pace if they get bored and distracted. Pack with other people, making it a social gathering. If you can't do that, at least put on your favorite movie or an energetic soundtrack. This will help keep you on task.   Start with the most difficult items to pack. This means that by the end, when you're getting tired, you'll be able to knock out the easy items just like that.  Once you’re done packing, load the boxes and items into a truck or other transportation method for getting them to their final destination. Put the tools, like the hand truck, that you got to good use and be sure to strap everything down. You may also want to wrap large items, like bed headboards and dressers, in blankets, in order to keep them from getting scratched by boxes.  

sort through all of your stuff first.  find some boxes.  get some tools.  set aside items you'll need immediately.  separate out really important or valuable items.  start organizing.  pack delicate items cleverly to keep them from breaking.  make good use of space.  stay focused and motivated.  load it up! 

   Small bites of crackers, muffins or pretzels can help perk your energy throughout the day.  Avoid dining with others if certain smells or foods trigger nausea.   Foods high in carbohydrates and protein make good choices for lunch, as both can help stave off nausea. A good lunch may include foods such as low-fat yogurt, peanut butter, bananas, cheese, toast and grilled chicken. Avoid fried foods, which are harder for your body to digest.    Beverages that are warm or room temperature are easier to digest. If you're vomiting frequently, try sipping a sports drink, soup or fruit smoothie to replace lost nutrients. Some women also find that ginger ale helps soothe an upset stomach.    Place a wet washcloth in a plastic bag along with a dry washcloth to aid in any cleanup. A clean shirt and some extra foundation or powder helps maintain a good appearance at work. Mouthwash, gum and your toothpaste and toothbrush can help refresh your breath.  

keep snacks on hand to ward off an upset stomach--especially during the first trimester when a rush of hormones can cause morning sickness.  bring your own lunch with nausea-preventing foods.  drink between meals to stay hydrated, but take only small sips.  bring supplies to help you deal with vomiting at work. 

 This is an option that will work if you have leftover baby oatmeal or cereal. Run a nice warm bath and pour some of the oatmeal directly into the water (how much you use it up to you). The oatmeal will help to soothe irritated skin. You can also rub it against your skin with a hand towel or loofa to exfoliate.Oatmeal, in particular, can also lessen itching. So, if you or your child comes down with any type of rash, an oatmeal bath may be a good idea. It also has the benefit of being non-toxic in case of ingestion by younger children.  Get out a small bowl and add two jars of fruit baby food of your choice. Stage 1 will work the best. Then, add a couple drops of essential oil. Stir together and gradually add raw sugar until it reaches a thick, but moveable consistency. Use this mixture as a face or body scrub while taking a bath or shower.You can also make extra batches and store them for up to a week in a sealed container. If you fill up decorative glass jars this can also be a great gift idea.  Pull out a plastic bin and pour in your leftover baby cereals and liquid baby food. Then, let your child play and explore the different textures. Like many sensory activities, this can get quite messy so you may want to put a few towels down or even a plastic shower curtain before getting started. When they are finished, throw away the leftover food and rinse off all items that were used., Empty five or so varied colors of baby food into plastic bowls. Set out the bowls on a covered surface along with blank large sheets of paper. Let your child paint with their hands or give them brushes that they can use.   This type of art is not meant to last and be displayed. After the creation process is done you will need to throw away the food and art. Rinse off the artist and the utensils used. 

mix up a bath soak.  stir together a face and body scrub.  create a sensory bin.  use baby food as safe paint. 

 This will be enough for one person., Keep mixing until the yolks break and everything is combined.  Add in some salt and cayenne pepper. For extra flavor, chop up a scallion, and add it in. Don't worry about adding the cheese in. You will do that last.  There is no need to cover the eggs. You are not cooking the eggs all the way just yet because you will be "scrambling" them with a fork.  Be careful when handling the cup; it will be very hot.  Use a clean fork this time, so that you don't raw egg into the cooked eggs.  The paper towel will trap heat and moisture. It will also keep the eggs from drying out or turning cold. The eggs will continue cooking during this sitting time.  You can eat the eggs directly from the cup, or your can put them on a plate. To garnish the eggs, get a cherry or grape tomato, and cut it into fourths. Place the tomato on top of the eggs.  

find a 10 ounce (295 milliliters), microwave-safe cup.  add the eggs and milk and mix them together with a fork.  season the eggs, and still them one last time.  place the cup into the microwave and cook it on high for 45 seconds.  give the egg mixture a quick stir and microwave them for another 45 seconds.  remove the cup from the microwave and stir in the cheddar cheese.  cover the eggs with a paper towel and wait one minute.  consider garnishing the eggs with a small tomato before serving it. 

 Then you have two options:   You may subscribe to a site where you can browse through online recipes, put together a menu, and create a shopping list. Or if you can't find the time to sit down and put a menu together, you may use a ready made menu. These mostly come in the form of a newsletter, to which you must subscribe. Examples of both can be found in Sources and Citations.  There is a very extensive Recipes category. Who knows what you'll find there?

 Place 2 cups of Thai jasmine-scented white rice in the cooker.  Add 2 cups of water, 1 cup of coconut milk, and 1 tbsp. of dry shredded coconut to the rice. Stir the ingredients together with a plastic spoon until they're thoroughly combined to distribute the coconut flavor and to keep the rice from sticking. , This depends on how long it takes for the ingredients in your cooker to finish steaming.  Once it's done, fluffing the rice with the cooker spoon a bit will make it more soft and tasty., Enjoy this rice on its own or with chicken, veggies, or beef. You can also try it with shrimp, scallops, or other delicious seafood.  

place the rice in a rice cooker.  add the other ingredients.  cover the cooker and set it to cook.  ,  after your cooker reaches "warm" mode, cook the rice for another 10-15 minutes.  gently fluff the rice.  serve. 

 You've got to look after your appearance if you expect girls to be interested in it. The first step is regular showers, brushing your teeth daily, and wearing deodorant.  Body spray or cologne can make you more attractive to girls. Yellow armpit stains may be caused by antiperspirant deodorant. Depending on how much you sweat, you might be better off using a different, non-antiperspirant brand, and wearing a thin undershirt instead to catch some moisture.; , If any of your clothes are stained or tattered, throw them away and replace them. You don't need to buy into expensive designer fads or mimic what the "cool kids" wear, just to show that you think about your style.   Wear clothes that fit you comfortably, not too tight and not too baggy. Don't wear the same outfit so long that it gets smelly or that people start to comment on it. Ideally, toss your shirt in the laundry basket after one use, and your pants (trousers) after three.  Ironing your clothes doesn't hurt, especially when you're going to an event.  This isn't necessary to get noticed, but if you want a reputation as a "cool guy," it might pay off to stand out from the crowd. This could be a shirt with a funny joke on it, a brightly colored pin, or a pair of sunglasses.Choose something that you're comfortable wearing regularly, so people start to associate you with a unique style.   Run your choice by close friends first if you're not sure. There's a fine line between standing out in a crowd and looking silly. You can even cross that line and turn the attention to your benefit, but that takes a lot of self-confidence to pull off.  Confident body language can make a surprising difference in how approachable you look, and can boost your own self-esteem as well.Stand and sit straight up. Your shoulders should be pulled back and aligned over your hips, with the back of your neck straight up over them.   When standing without something to do, find a position that you can hold comfortably, so you don't fidget awkwardly. If you can't stop shifting your weight back and forth, lean slightly against a wall. If you have trouble keeping your hands still, hold a drink or other object at your side. Don't put the object in front of you, and don't use something distracting like a cell phone – both of these mistakes cut you off from your surroundings.  Keep your chin up and your head back while walking or standing, and look at the people around you. You'll see a lot more opportunities this way than if you're daydreaming or rushing down the street. This simple change in body language will make you seem more confident and accessible as well, two important traits for attracting social attention.  If you get tongue-tied or shaky when talking to women, spend some time alone building up to it. Sit in a private place and close your eyes, imagining feeling completely comfortable and calm. Keeping those feelings in mind, imagine walking up to a woman you've never met and introducing yourself.Repeat this exercise daily for a week, then try it in real life.   If you still don't feel ready, try making eye contact with strangers on the street and saying "Hello." Smile, and don't let yourself look away before they do., You might not think of yourself as a skilled talker, but a little advance preparation goes a long way to change that. Keep in mind that the first conversation you have with someone shouldn't explore deep issues of faith, politic stances, or lifelong dreams, unless they're clearly interested. It's just a quick way to get a conversation flowing. Here are some examples of ways you can prepare, depending on your age and the kind of people you spend time with:   Listen to popular music and think about your opinions on it. If you don't like it, find a band you do like and write down how it's similar to more well-known music, and why you like it more. Watch movies currently in theaters, or currently running television shows. Read news sites or the newspaper daily to catch up on current events or local news.  Come up with two or three interesting stories from your life, to tell when the conversation stops. This is a great way to show that you're a cool and interesting person.   If you're passionate about a hobby, talk about it. People are often most interesting when talking about something they love. Humor is a great tool to use, if used properly. Try to tease yourself or make funny observations about the situation you're in. Teasing the woman or people around you should be kept to a minimum, and should always be light-hearted, not mean.  The "brooding guy in a corner" look isn't nearly as cool or attractive as it seems. Walk up to people and say hi, and make an effort to listen to the conversation and respond to it. The more people are directly interacting with you, the more you'll be noticed by other people in the surroundings.   Don't think of this as "picking a target." Talking to men can work fine, as long as they don't try to overshadow you or dominate the conversation.  When you're looking for someone to approach, scan their faces, not their shoes or the sky – and definitely not anywhere else on their anatomy. Once you make eye contact with someone, smile and say hello. Keep looking at the other person's eyes during the conversation.  Once you're in conversation with a girl, tilt your head and shoulders forward slightly. This is a cue that you're engaged in the conversation, and interested in continuing it., A small compliment is a much better first step than a long speech about how long you've been crushing on her or how she stunned you as soon as you laid eyes on her. It's tough to come up with a compliment that doesn't sound generic or forced, but with some practice you'll get the smiles and blushes that show you're on the right track.   If you know something about her work or something she did, compliment that instead of her appearance. Try to make beauty-related compliments unique to her, and focus on something she controls, such as her hairstyle or clothing choices. A straightforward remark works better than a cheesy pick up line or catcall. "You seemed so warm and friendly that I wanted to come over and introduce myself" won't win any prizes, but it will start more conversations than "Heyyyy sexy."  

maintain your personal hygiene.  pay attention to your wardrobe.  choose an attention grabber (optional).  practice confident posture.  pay attention to your surroundings.  boost your confidence with visualization.  have conversation starters ready.  prepare stories about yourself.  join conversations.  make eye contact and smile.  lean forward slightly while talking.  compliment her. 

 It's a truism that many people struggle with cycles of dieting. The reality for many following diets is frustration and often dangerous swings of weight gains and losses. Instead of worrying constantly about the latest diet fad or which diet will make you lose the most weight, discard the focus on special diets altogether. By shifting to intuitive eating habits instead, you'll never have to diet, for, eventually, you will follow a well-balanced process of feeding your body what it needs without compromising on the happiness!; , The hunger urge is not an evil, negative instinct; sadly, it has been demonized by the diet industry to seem like something to be constantly purged and ignored. Hunger, on the contrary, is a positive instinct that evolves to tell you when you need an energy refill––vilifying so helpful and basic an instinct is neurotic. When your body feels deprived of nutrients and calories (energy), it sends hunger signals to the brain. If you try to suppress this instinct, you risk binge-eating foods that are poor in nutrition as a "quick fix" for that gnawing inside. By responding quickly and sensibly to your body's hunger urges, you can eat smaller portions, feel satisfied quickly and find the energy you need to keep going strong.   There is a reason for the time-proven, traditional meal set each day: By eating balanced meals every 3–5 hours, you ensure that your body maintains a steady level of energy. By fueling your body with properly balanced foods, you will not experience deprivation in nutrients, calories or energy.  One of the most common mistakes people make when trying to change their lifestyle is to convince themselves that food must be avoided. This battle manifests itself in feelings of deprivation. When you feel deprived, you are more likely to give in to temptation. Acknowledge that your body needs food.  Instead of constantly labeling yourself as “bad” or “good”—depending on how many calories you've consumed in a day or what types of food you've eaten—simply acknowledge that food is necessary and healthy. Trust your body to let you know what types of food it needs.   For example, if you don’t normally eat meat, but suddenly find yourself craving a meal of red meat and a fresh spinach salad, your body could be indicating to you that you are low on iron and need to supplement your daily diet with more foods that contain higher levels of iron. Instead of feeling guilty about consuming more calories in the day than you think you should, accept that you body knows what to do to balance itself. Be grateful that you have access to what your body needs—not everyone does.  Just as the body sends signals to the brain when it needs food and sustenance, it also informs us to stop eating.   When our stomach is full, the brain receives a message. However, many people eat without paying careful attention to their bodies and the signals they receive. Since it takes the brain approximately 20 minutes to register the food you consume, if you eat too quickly or too casually (mindlessly in front of the television or computer), you may miss the full signal and end up overeating.  Cramming food in to fit around work life isn't healthy, either. That hot dog bolted down in a five-minute break between meetings will leave you hankering for sugary, fatty snacks mid-afternoon when your energy levels crash. Find a minimum of 20 minutes for a decent lunch instead––if the meetings cannot wait, work needs rescheduling, not your diet.  The best way to immerse yourself into an intuitive eating cycle is to acknowledge that eating gives you a sense of satisfaction, and to stop punishing yourself for feeling satisfied by food.   The guilt that many people have about eating actually creates a secret urge to binge-eat what they consider "bad foods." This gives food unnecessary power—which disempowers you in the process. Acknowledge that eating is satisfying, and move on.  Many people use food as a comfort agent to deal with problems such as anxiety, depression, and anger. Know there are healthier ways to deal with these emotions. Acknowledging this behavior will help you stop using food as a security blanket.   Use food to fuel your body, not to improve your mood or let off steam. Intuitive eaters recognize the true purpose of food and strive to find alternative methods for mood improvement. Keep a food diary to help you notice the emotional triggers in your life. This can help you to find alternative ways of coping with stressful or emotional moments—such as meditation, taking a walk, listening to music or simply relaxing.  Not every person is capable of being a size 2 or having a 30-inch waist. Bodies are built differently. Some bodies have fat deposits that are curvy, some have block-shaped fat deposits. There is no way to change the natural disposition of your body, so it is important to stop trying. If you place unnecessary restrictions on yourself in order to achieve a physically impossible goal, you will become frustrated and depressed.  Don't think you have to abuse or exhaust yourself. Just move regularly through physical activity and revel in the differences you experience. An active body is a healthy body, and a healthy body feels great! Physical activity is also a very effective way to release stress, which can turn into a major trigger for emotional eating if left bottled up for too long.   Match your body shape and stamina to the exercise. While one style of exercise may be all the rage, it might not be your perfect match. Try different types of exercise to find what you enjoy doing and what makes a constructive difference to your fitness. If you can't work this out alone, ask a fitness coach, doctor or physiotherapist to help. When you "click" with the exercise you do, it will become a lifelong passion and won't feel like a chore. Again, this is an intuitive response!  , An about-face transformation of your diet can leave you feeling hungry, depressed, anxious or frustrated. Instead of trying to revolutionize your entire diet in a few short days, simply try to gradually adjust the foods you eat. Pay careful attention to the types of food you eat, the frequency at which you eat, and the reasons why you are eating.   Notice which foods leave you feeling sub-optimal and lacking in energy. Equally, make note of those that leave you feeling buzzed and alert. Steer toward the food that makes you feel optimal and good, not the food that might be an easy option but that leads to a fast slump.  

avoid developing a diet mentality.  pay attention to your hunger.  stop avoiding food.  stop punishing yourself.  pay attention to signals of fullness.  acknowledge the satisfaction of eating foods that you love.  pay attention to feelings.  recognize the limitations of your body.  exercise regularly.  gently change your eating habits. 

 Getting a Handgun can be hard if you are not prepared, so take as many health and mana potions (if you’re a mage class) you can with you.  You can craft a bed using a Sawmill. To craft one, you will need 15 Wood and 5 Silk.  If you don’t have a Sawmill, craft one at the Crafting Table using 10 Wood, 2 Iron/Lead Bars, and 1 Chain. If you don’t want to craft, you can take a bed from abandoned houses.  This is used to light up your respawn room.  You can craft a torch with Wood and Gel, or you can buy one from a merchant for 50 coins.  Bring enough blocks to make a decent-sized room to respawn in. Also bring some wall blocks to fill in the room you will be making., This can be any weapon of your choice; just make sure you have one., The Handgun is only obtainable through the chests found in the dungeon. The dungeon is located at one end of the map, usually opposite the jungle, so head there.   If you still can’t find the dungeon, try walking to one edge of the map. If you find that you’ve reach the ocean, this means that the dungeon is at the other end of the map.  Once you’ve reached the dungeon, it is recommended that you build a respawn point. The process of building a room is slightly different depending on the platform you’re playing Terraria on:   For PC, hit the ESC key or press the number that the block is assigned to to equip the block then left-click on the area you want to place the block in. For Xbox, open the inventory menu (Y) and use the D-pad to navigate and highlight a block you want to use. Press A once the block is highlighted, and use the right analog stick to set your cursor to the area you want to place the block in. For mobile, hit the icon at the end of the Item slots to open the inventory menu. Tap and drag the block you want to use into one of the first five item slots at the top of the inventory menu. Tap the block in the item slot then tap on the area you want to place the block in to build the bedroom. The minimum required width of a room for respawning in is 9, and the height, 4.  Cover the room with wall blocks to prevent mobs from spawning there., Open your inventory (ESC on PC, icon on mobile, or Y on Xbox 360), and select the bed. Once you have the bed selected, tap, press A, or click on the area you want to place the bed in.  Right-click (PC), B button (Xbox 360), or tap (mobile) the bed to set your spawn point. You will get a “Spawn Point Added” notification at the lower-right corner of your screen., Head to the entrance of the dungeon and walk through the door., First you must journey down into the dungeon and fight the mobs there. Along the way, you’ll find chests scattered randomly in the dungeon, and one may contain a Handgun.  Since contents of the chests are random, there’s no guarantee that you’ll get a Handgun on the first, second, or even third run into the dungeon. You’ll just have to be patient and continue going through the dungeon and opening chests until you get a Handgun. If you die, you will respawn at the bed in the bedroom you built before entering the dungeon.  

bring lots of health and mana potions.  craft a bed.  bring a torch.  bring blocks.  bring a weapon.  head for the dungeon.  build the room.  place walls.  place the bed at one end of the room.  set your spawn point.  enter the dungeon.  find chests. 

 When spending time with your girlfriend's dad, dress in a way that will make you look trustworthy. Adult clothing is best, ideally in a "business casual" style. You want to look non-threatening and clean-cut.Wear a shirt with buttons and some clean, well fitted pants. Don't wear clothes that are dirty or have images or words on them that might be offensive to her dad. This is especially important the first time you meet her dad.  When you greet your girlfriend's father, give him a firm handshake and look him in the eye. This shows respect and friendliness.Don't grip his hand too hard and hurt him, but by the same token, don't give a limp, weak handshake. This can lead to a less favorable impression of you., Whenever you spend time with your girlfriend's dad, be respectful and polite. Say "please" and "thank you," don't curse, and generally use your best manners.Many people see good manners as a sign of good moral character.   Always address your girlfriend's dad respectfully. Either call him "sir" or "Mr. ," unless he tells you to call him something else. A formal address is a sign of respect and good judgement., However nervous or awkward you might feel around your girlfriend's dad, act as confident and comfortable as you can. Look him in the eye when you talk, stand up straight, and avoid fidgeting.   Showing nervousness can sometimes suggest you are hiding something.At the same time, don't be overconfident or showy. This can also be off-putting to people or suggest you aren't genuine., When you talk to your girlfriend's dad, talk about things you like and feel good about. Don't brag, but talk about things that cast you in a positive light. Involve your girlfriend in the conversation, and talk about things the two of you enjoy doing together.Talk about things you like about school, work, or hobbies. Most people prefer talking to people who are positive. Don't gripe or complain. If you have hobbies or interests in common with your girlfriend's dad, talk about those. Whether its sports or spirituality, people are more likely to trust others who they feel are similar to themselves., If you are old enough to drink and are offered a drink while you are spending time with your girlfriend's father, it's fine to have one or two (unless he disapproves of drinking altogether). Don't overdo it, however.If you have too much to drink, you are more likely to say or do something that might seem untrustworthy to your girlfriend's dad. Even if you don't actually do anything that raises red flags, many people see over-drinking as irresponsible or as a sign of weak moral character.  

dress well.  shake his hand.  be polite.  act confident.  talk about positive things.  don't drink too much. 

 Danish is a tricky language, but it does have plenty in common with other north European languages. It is one of five North Germanic languages, along with Swedish, Norwegian, Icelandic, and Faroese. Danish is comprehensible for someone fluent in Swedish or Norway, so if you can speak Danish you will be able to talk to people across Scandinavia.   An English speaker will recognise quite a few Danish words, which are similar to the English. For example, the Danish word drømme is similar to the English word dream, æg is like egg, flad is like flat, and søster is like sister. A big difference between English and Danish is the way words are pronounced, so it’s important to practice your speaking and listening a lot. Grammatically, Danish has two genders, masculine and neuter which take articles en and et.; , It’s best to start by learning a few basic greetings and phrases to give you a taste of speaking Danish, and some early pointers about pronunciation. Here are some easy everyday phrases to practice:   Hello – Hej (pronounced Hi). Good day – Goddag (pronounced Go-day). Goodbye – Farvel (pronounced Fah-vel). Yes – Ja (pronounced Ya). No – Nej (pronounced Nai). Thank you – Tak (pronounced Tack). Excuse me – Undskyld (pronounced Un-school). Sorry – Beklager (pronounced Bi-clay-er)., You really need to listen and repeat Danish words to get a hang of the pronunciation, and get used to how letters and words sound. To develop your skills you’ll have to practice speaking to people and having conversations in Danish, but before you get to that level you can build confidence by listening to clips online.   Search online for clips of Danish words and phrases. There are a number of websites that have audio clips for key phrases, such as “hej,” “farvel” and “velkommen.”, When you’re trying to work on your pronunciation in a new language, it’s a good idea to pay particular attention to the vowel sounds. There can be a lot of variation in vowel sounds across different languages, and vowel sounds are at the centre of every word. Practice the following vowel sounds for Danish:   a – pronounced “ah.” ä, æ – pronounced like the “a” sound in the English word “ash.” å, aa – pronounced “aw” or “oh.” e – pronounced as “eh.” I –pronounced as “ee,” or shortened to “ih” when placed before a double consonant. o – pronounced “oh” ø – pronounced like the German or Swedish letter “ö,” or French sound “eu.” u – pronounced like the “u” sound in the English word "put." y – pronounced like the German “ü” or the French “u.”, To really work on improving your Danish speaking skills you should consider signing up for a class. Joining a Danish class will give you plenty of opportunities to practice speaking alongside listening, reading and grammar practice. To get good at speaking a new language takes a lot of practice, and joining a class will give you a group of fellow Danish learners to practice with.   The teacher will often be a native Danish speaker, and will be able to answer your questions face-to-face. The teacher will be able to correct your pronunciation and spot areas where you make regular mistakes. Search online for language schools near you. Often local schools and colleges will run adult education courses in languages. Danish classes may not be as easy to find as Spanish, French, German or Italian. You can access contact information for a number of professional organisations through the website of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages: http://www.actfl.org/about-actfl/resources/member-organization-map   , The Danish Cultural Institute is an independent organisation that is funded by the Danish government. This Institute works to promote Danish culture abroad as well as international cultural exchange. It often hosts concerts, exhibitions and theatre and film events, as well as offering Danish classes.   There are Institutes in a number of countries, including Brazil, China and Russia.To find about events and activities related to Denmark and Danish culture in your country, you can contact the Danish Embassy.You can find the contact details for the Embassy and Consulate in your country here: http://um.dk/en/about-us/organisation/find-us-abroad/   , To study Danish in a more focused way, you might consider hiring a private tutor some for one-to-one lessons. These more intensive classes will require you to talk in Danish a lot more, and you can develop your speaking skills more quickly through this greater exposure. You lose some of the fun of a group dynamic, and one-to-one classes will be more expensive, but you do get the complete attention of the tutor.   If you think this could be a good approach for you, start by searching online for tutors advertising themselves. Use trusted websites when looking for private tutors and always look for online reviews. Consider the tutor’s qualifications and experience, and ask for a trial lesson before you commit to booking in a block of lessons.  If you are struggling to find a regular time to have lessons or you want to access more materials to practice in your spare time, you can use online resources and websites that provide lots of opportunities to develop your Danish. There are some comprehensive websites which have a lot of information about grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation.There are lots of free apps for language learners, and big ones such as Babbel and Duolingo have Danish sections. An advantage of these apps is that you can practice whenever you have your smart phone.  To improve your speaking you will need to get lots of practice in conversational Danish. To do this you will need to find people that you can talk to in Danish. If you have joined a class, ask some of your classmates if they would like to get some extra practice by meeting up for a coffee and some Danish conversation.Try to only speak in the foreign language for ten minutes, and then gradually increase this period as you get more accomplished.  If you want to practice your Danish, you can offer your language skills in exchange. The internet makes it easy for language learners to get in touch and communicate. You can find someone to write to or chat to online, who is a native Danish speaker and will be able to advise you on informal as well as formal aspects of the language and culture.   Talking to someone around your own age who is not a tutor will expose you to more slang expressions and casual conversational Danish. Visit a language exchange website and look for people offering their Danish skills.You may find people who live in your city and are interested in meeting up for a language exchange.  If you are not learning with others it can be tricky to find someone to practice speaking Danish with. Lots of language teachers are working online, and typically a skype lesson will be cheaper than a one-to-one lesson. You may be able to negotiate a lower rate for a lesson if you say that you want to focus more on speaking and conversational practice, as this is likely to require less preparation time for the tutor., One lesson a week of an hour or two, or an evening on a language website will not be enough time to really learn Danish. The key to your success is the amount of practice you do outside of class. Try to take every opportunity to expose yourself to Danish and immerse yourself in the language as much as possible.   Watching films and TV programmes in the language you are learning can help you get used to the sound of the language, so ask your teacher for some recommendations.If possible, visit Denmark on holiday to try out your Danish conversational skills.  

learn about the danish language.  learn some simple phrases.  listen for the pronunciation.  concentrate on the vowel sounds.  consider joining a class.  investigate classes provided by the danish cultural institute.  hire a private tutor.  use free online resources and apps.  practice speaking with others.  find an online danish language exchange partner.  talk to a tutor over skype.  immerse yourself in danish. 

 Physics is a huge field. If the parent or child has already outlined difficulty areas, this step has been done for you. If not, find age-appropriate material. Something interest about physics is how you can explain phenomena in a very simple way, or you get get way into the nitty-gritty with complex math. Try looking at overviews of physics topics online for each age group.  Don't confine yourself to just theory talk when possible, but be aware of particular assignments the child may have.   A few example topics appropriate for young children:  The big picture for gravity. The Earth is really massive, so smaller objects get pulled towards it. You can have fun dropping things, and maybe talk about how gravity causes tides. Collisions! This will have to be a very shallow overview, but you can talk about elastic and inelastic collisions. More dropping things! You can drop clay on the ground and see it go SPLAT, and compare it to a bouncy ball. Also look at memory foam and balloons. Light. This is a big one. Prisms, rainbows, filters, all sorts of cool things here!   Middle school children can handle more complex topics, but without heavy math:  Magnets and electricity. Fun projects like making engines from magnets and copper wire, and a creating a battery with a potato are engaging and involve other topics as well. Energy and work. Can be incorporated well with magnets and electricity projects. Conservation of energy can be introduced in basic ways. Waves: sound/light. Talk about transverse waves and longitudinal: it's a great opportunity to sneak in slinkies! Get more into things like frequency as well.   High-school children are at age where math can play a more significant role; be sure to find out what kind of math background they have. High-school kids are can handle surface introductions to most topics, and much more in-depth explorations to some of the topics listed above. Furthermore, it's more likely that high-school students will have homework that your tutoring sessions will be based off of.  Once you have your specific topic, and an idea of age-appropriate depth for that topic, you can begin planning. Motivate the beginning of the project with a brief discussion of a phenomena it explains, like rainbows for light or car engines for work. Ask the child questions and work from their responses. Determine the child's attention span and plan your cool-stuff-demos accordingly, both in terms of frequency between theory and in length of project. If the child has a long attention span, they can build things themselves. If not, they may need to be shown the completed demo and be allowed to explore it, or take part in only the last few steps of its creation. Read up on lesson planning in general (see related wikiHow articles), and be flexible: the amount of time to grasp a topic can vary greatly. Part of the point of a tutor is provide personalized attention. If you are tutoring for a class, try to keep on track with the class schedule. You may be helping with individual homework assignments, which can limit your autonomy in planning.  Check in with the parent, pay attention to the child's responses, and if you are tutoring for a class, ask if you can see the class assessments like homework and tests.  

narrow it down.  keep it age-appropriate, and creative.  plan the lessons.  be constantly receptive to feedback. 

 They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and it's true - if you eat a good breakfast, you'll have more energy to do the activities that you want to do.   You may run into the problem of a breakfast you don't like. While most camps will have multiple options and usually have cereal, sometimes you may find yourself out of luck. The best thing you can do is to try a little bit of everything, and you'll eventually find something you like.  Most camps have activities like archery, canoeing, arts and crafts, and nature hikes, but many also have other, more non-traditional activities. Some may even have an activity involving computers! Make sure you sign up for something at every chance you get.   Whatever they have, Try to do one thing that you know you love and three things that you have never tried before. Who knows? you may find something you really, really love! Whatever you do, it's going to be hot outside, so Try to go swimming at least once while you are at camp, if you can. Make sure that you also have a bottle of water with you at all times so that you don't get dehydrated.  You're likely doing a lot more physical activity than normal at camp, so making sure you eat three square meals a day is a must.   If you can, eat a little more than you normally do to make sure that you still have enough energy to keep you going!  , Usually, there is a lot of downtime while waiting for a spot in the showers, so play a few games with your camp friends to pass the time.   Singing camp songs is also a fun way to spend your spare time. They may be a little silly, but they're a good way to have a laugh and they're loads of fun! If you have the supplies, you can use your down time to write letters home. Be sure to include some important things in your letter:  What you're doing at camp Your favorite part of each day What you're looking forward to tomorrow Anything else you want to add    , Naturally you and your cabin/tent-mates will want to stay up talking (this is especially common with girls), but try, once again, to get at least a little bit of sleep each night so that you can be awake for the next day's activities.  

make sure you grab some breakfast every day to keep you going.  check out some of the activities.  don't forget to eat lunch and dinner!,  play a few more games when you get some down time!,  make sure you get some sleep each night.

 She should be able to see you coming. Sneaking up on the horse from behind can startle it.   Make sure you have your rope, halter, and maybe a treat with you before you go out to catch your horse. Talk to the the horse as you approach. Use a quiet calming tone to let her know you are coming and that you don't mean her any harm.; , Take easy deliberate steps. Don’t rush after the horse or it will get scared and run away from you. If the horse seems startled or if it turns away, stop and wait for her to settle down before advancing again., Don’t approach with the halter outstretched. This will startle the horse. It may recognize the halter and panic. Also, keeping your arms down will make you appear more neutral and less threatening., Waving your hands or advancing too quickly toward the horse will cause it to run away., If the horse does get spooked and makes a run for it just stay where you are. Chasing after it will only startle it even more. Instead, wait for it to stop. Give the horse a few minutes to feel safe again, then start advancing slowly and try once more.  Be gentle so as not to startle the horse. Your main goal here is to come off as nonthreatening as possible. Use smooth even strokes. Give the horse time to get used to your presence., This is called giving the horse “release." After you have spent a few seconds caressing the face or neck, step back in full view of the horse. Stand with a nonthreatening pose, arms down, feet together, to show the horse that you mean it no harm.  After you’ve given the horse some “release” step back toward it and start caressing the face and neck again. This way you are building trust with the horse.   Swat some flies out of the horse’s face if there are any.Try talking to the horse in a calm voice. It may not know what you are saying, but the sound of your voice can show you mean it no harm.  Keep this pattern up for about four or five minutes. The horse should start to calm down. Each time you advance to pet it again, spend a little more time with it. You’ll know the horse is calm if it lowers its head to receive your caress or if it continues to eat or remains relatively still while you are touching it., Once the horse is calm, approach it one last time. Pet the face and neck and as you do, slide the halter onto the horse's nose. Bring your other arm up around the neck to secure the clasp around the back of the head. After it is secure, continue to pet the horse and keep it calm., The halter should be snug but not so tight it is digging into the horse's face. There should be enough slack under the horse's face so that you can slip two fingers inbetween the horse and the halter without much resistance. , Once the halter is secure, let some of the slack from the rope hang between you and the horse. Tugging too hard or pulling the horse with too much force will anger or startle it., Pull lightly on the rope, just enough so that the horse can feel the pressure and understand that you want it to follow you., When you can, go out into the field with a treat or some grains and visit the horse. Approach it slowly, feed it the treat, and then walk away. The horse will learn that being approached by a human is not always a threatening thing. Then, when you do want to go out and catch your horse, she will be more open to having you approach her., When you do catch the horse and bring it in to do some work or saddle it up for a ride, make sure you are doing everything you can to make it pleasant for the horse.Bring her some treats. Feed her some grains after she gets caught. Give the horse a thorough grooming. Vary up the work to keep your horse interested. Praise your horse when she does something well.  The more often you take your horse out, even just to lead her down a short path or give her a new area to run around in, the more likely she is to be willing to be caught.  It’s important to create a relationship with your horse and to give her time to play on her own and with other horses. Take your horse for an easy trail ride.Spend some extra time grooming and pampering your horse. Give her treats.Let her out with other horses she enjoys being with.  

approach the horse from the front and slightly to one side.  start walking toward the horse slowly.  hold your arms down.  don’t make any sudden movements.  if the horse runs away, don’t go running after it.  reach out slowly to pet the horse on the face and neck.  step back after a couple of strokes.  pet the horse again.  repeat petting and giving the horse release.  slide the halter onto the horse.  don’t strap the halter on tight.  avoid tugging hard on the rope.  lead the horse slowly.  visit your horse in the field often without intending to catch it.  make getting caught easy and enjoyable for the horse.  take your horse out often.  let your horse have fun with you and on her own. 

 If you are sneaking up on someone in your family, or a person you live with, it is likely that you know their bedtime routine. Most people learn a bedtime routine at a very young age. It may change slightly over time, but most people have certain things they do before they go to sleep.A bedtime routine can involve things like brushing teeth, grabbing a glass of water, taking a bath or reading a book. Pay close attention for a few nights to learn the routine of the person you want to sneak up on.; , Beyond their routine, the person’s body can give them away. Watch for cues that they are getting sleepy. If they are yawning, rubbing their eyes, or beginning to nod off, you know that they will be sleeping soon.   They may even doze off right in front of you, making sneaking up on them really easy.  If they have gone to bed and closed the door, listen closely for clues that they are sleeping. Beyond that, you also want to listen for warnings that they may still be awake. Stay close and listen carefully to figure out what they are doing.   You may hear them turn the television off, switch off the light, or start snoring. You could hear the bed springs squeak if they are rolling around, they may cough or get up to go to the bathroom  , Don’t act too early. In fact, just when you think the person is asleep, wait a little while longer. You are more likely to wake someone who is in the first or second stage of sleep, than when they reach a deeper sleep. Give yourself and the other person a few extra minutes to fall deeper into sleep before you pounce., Some items of clothing can make noise when you walk. Avoid wearing something that is going to give you away. A good choice of clothing would be some flannel sleeping pants, a cotton t-shirt and some socks to keep your steps quiet.   Steer clear of things like wind pants that swish at the thighs, tennis shoes which could squeak on wood floors, and even jeans may pop in the crotch area.  Don’t let a cough or a sneeze sneak up on you when you are trying to sneak up on someone else. Do everything you can to avoid coughing or sneezing, and suppress these urges if you feel them coming on.   Wet your throat by drinking a glass of water before you begin your mission. Try sucking on a cough drop while you sneak around.Blow your nose before you start to keep anything in there from making you sneezy. If you do feel a sneeze coming, plug your nostrils, then pull to stretch your nose., You may feel compelled to hold you breath, but the volume of air in your lungs will cause your body to react. You are required to exhale and if you need air, your lungs will eventually gasp for it. Instead, take slow, controlled breaths.   Breathe in slowly through your mouth for eight counts, then exhale through your mouth for eight counts to keep your breathing slow, even and quiet.  Avoid creaks and squeaks. Creaky floors and squeaky doors could wake the person up and give you away. Walk around the house in advance and learn what parts of the floor creak and which doors squeak when you open them, then avoid those areas or fix the noise.   Stairs tend to be especially creaky because they have so many pieces of wood put together to make the staircase.If there is a staircase between you and the person you are sneaking up on, make sure you cross the stairs before they fall asleep. Walk through open doors, or put some petroleum jelly on the hinges before you have to open them sneakily., You don’t want to have to turn on any lights. It is important to adjust your eyes to the darkness, so you can navigate your path to the sleeping person. Give your eyes time to adjust to the darkness so you don’t bump into anything on your way.Wait in the dark for ten minutes to allow cones of your eyes to adjust to the darkness.  A flat foot makes more noise. To get really close to someone without waking them, step forward and set down your heel first. Roll along the outside of your foot from your heel to your pinky toe.Put your foot firmly down before you put weight on it. Stay balanced. Don’t pick up your other foot until your weight is firmly balanced on your planted foot. Keep it slow. It should take a full 20 seconds to complete three steps.  They may hear you or detect that there is someone else in the room. If the are already facing you or you hear them rolling around, stop moving and try to blend into the dark.You may have to stay frozen for several minutes while you wait for them to settle back into sleep.  No matter how dark the room is, there is probably still a little ambient light coming from the moon or street lights. The thing that will really give you away is your silhouette. People may look around if they suspect your presence, but they will look around at eye level.   Stay low to the ground and hide behind objects to avoid being visible.  

monitor their bedtime routine.  keep your eyes on them.  listen for clues.  be patient.  wear quiet clothing.  keep your body from giving you away.  control your breathing.  plan your path.  prepare your eyes for darkness.  walk silently by rolling your feet.  freeze if they move or are facing you.  hide in the shadows. 

 Playing a game for hours on end leads to problems, such as addiction and obsession. Play for an hour or two without any distractions to build up knowledge of the game. If you are playing at night, be sure that parents don't find out and you have the volume on low.; , Games are dull and boring if it's not what you like to play, too challenging, or too confusing. Experiment by borrowing games from friends or renting games from video stores. If you grow into liking it, convince a parent to buy it for you.  Avoid using cheats, if possible. Cheats can ruin the fun of the game, especially if you're just starting it. Spend a few days or so on easy levels of the game so that you can familiarize yourself with it.  Get your friends to help you if you're stuck on something or if you want to play multi-player.  Often, mastering the the controls to a game will help you do better than if you hadn't.  

keep a schedule of playing.  get an interest in a game.  train by starting off on easy levels.  advance to higher levels once you get the hang of everything.  learn the controls well. 

 You can tell this if he or she is able to dribble (kicking ball close to your feet) and can shoot with accuracy.; , Ask them if they would enjoy playing soccer or anything related to that. (Watch soccer with them, play soccer with them.) Sometimes joining (or starting) a soccer league of your own will help your child enjoy the game more.  If they don't, you shouldn't force them to play.  In some areas there are both spring and fall leagues, but because fall is the soccer season, it is usually more competitive and has better coaching than the spring leagues.  However, remind them that it is everything and it is not all about winning. As long as they do their best and have fun, you will always be proud of them.  Your child will understand that he can play with you more often, or play by him/herself when you are not around. It is inexpensive and takes only 3-4 hours to get trained to coach in a youth soccer league.  

see if your child has the talents of a soccer player.  see if your child has any interest in the sport.  encourage their interest by modeling your own.  send them to a soccer school or camp and watch them the first couple of days to see if they enjoy it.  put them in a fall soccer league.  support them and be with them, even if they fail.  get trained and be a coach. 

 The first step in successfully advertising your photography business online involves creating a functioning site. Your website should have samples of your past work, and display your contact information so that new clients can get call or email you. Concentrate on highlighting your talent by putting recent work at the forefront of the page.Photographers must have a good grasp of composition, and a poorly designed website can leave a negative impression. Keep the site as simple and straightforward as possible. Ensure that the navigation is intuitive and remove unnecessary information or anything can confuse potential clients.; , Business pages like Google, Yelp, and the Yellow Pages Online will help boost your exposure and help people connect to you. Make sure to tag and keyword entries on your website so that when people search for photography in their area they can find your page. Keep up with customer reviews and make sure to personally and directly respond to any criticism or bad reviews from former clients.   Other websites that would be worth listing your business include the White Pages, Angie's List, Yahoo, and Bing.Remember to provide your contact information and to add a link your website on your business pages.  Social media allows you to connect to future clients or fans of your work. Keep an active Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, and Flickr page. Don't try to balance all the platforms if you don't have the time. Instead, choose a couple of platforms and make sure that you have quality posts.Do this by making your posts interesting and relevant. Post your work on social media to display your skills and talent.   You have to keep Twitter posts under 140 characters.Twitter is more action oriented and should key people into what your company is doing. Adding a photo will typically also get you more re-tweets and likes. An example of a Twitter message would be, "We're working on a new project with Gina's Cheesesteaks on Broad Street. Come on over and check out the action." Post on Instagram around 5:00 to 6:00 pm since this is when the majority of users are online. Make sure to post a robust photo.A sample of an Instagram post may be something like, "Check out these amazing photos that Chelsea was able to take during the Philadelphia Pride Parade. If you'd like to pick up a print of one of the photos, click here to go to our website." Don't use a personal page for your business. Create one specifically for your photography business. Each platform has ideal post length and volume of posts throughout the day. For a platform like Facebook, you should only post once or twice per day. For more active social media like Twitter, five or more posts per day are usually appropriate.You can also upload photography on your social media platforms to give people a taste of what you're working on, or to build up a following online. Social media that's used specifically for photography include Pinterest, Instagram, and Flickr.  Your online portfolio should be a larger catalog of high-quality digital images that you can forward to potential clients. Make sure to use utilize responsive design so that image sizes scale with different resolutions.   Keep your portfolio to 12 photos per page. If you add more photos than 12 photos, your portfolio may look cluttered. Limit the amount the user has to scroll. Use thumbnails so that the person looking at your portfolio can easily access the photos they enjoy the most.Choose only your highest quality work. If a photograph is questionable because of any reason, it shouldn't be a photo you add to your portfolio. Popular hosts for photography include Squarespace, Format, Zenfolio, and 500px., Since photography is sometimes subjective, people who hire a photographer will often do so based on things like their personality or the quality of your relationship. Add your client testimonials to your website so that future customers can see what your past clients had to say about you.   For intimate shoots like wedding photography, having a courteous and flexible photographer is a requirement for many couples. 

build a functioning website.  get on business pages.  keep your social media updated regularly.  have a high-quality online portfolio.  gather client testimonials.

 Most escorts are professionals, and aren't going to judge you for having normal human emotions like anxiety. Remember, she's human, too.; ,, It's there for a reason, and reading it can save you from uncomfortable rejections if you and the escort are not on the same page.  Calling her and asking, "Which one are you again?" will not impress her.  A daytime escort will not be happy to speak to you at 4am.  Do you want a romantic relationship? Do you expect to be allowed to hurt her or treat her like a blowup doll? Do you just want to talk dirty on the phone? Are you trying to get caught and make your wife jealous? She will not tolerate any of this behaviour.  Remember that most escorts won't answer a blocked number.  Is this (whoever)?" If it's an agency, you will end up speaking to a booking agent, so you may have to adapt this advice accordingly. If it's the escort, keep smiling.  Do not ask her, "What's up?" Talk to her as you would other professional service providers.  Don't make her repeat every bit of information on it. She has limited time and expects you to be able to read.  Be smart enough to read between the lines of her ad, especially if you're trying this in the US. Unless you're in an area where this is completely legal or decriminalized, a smart escort will not answer questions about specific acts or anything explicit and will probably refuse to speak to you again if you try. Always remember, an escort is offering her time, not specific acts. Don't try to argue about her answer, or bribe her to change her mind.  Don't make her choose when -- she has no idea what your schedule is like. If she can accommodate you, she will. If not, she will suggest the closest time that works for her.  She will want to verify them to make sure it is not a prank call and that she can let someone know where she is. If you're meeting at her place, don't be pushy for her exact address. Remember that she doesn't know you yet and doesn't want to end up in the uncomfortable situation of you showing up early, or stopping by in the middle of the night. She wants to earn an income, so she isn't likely to leave you hanging. Just be patient.  You will probably have to call one more time to let her know you are close and ready to come see her. Or, if you're meeting at your place, she will call you.  If your appointment is still several hours away, and you change your mind, call and cancel. Explain your reason politely, and apologise. If you are at her door or just minutes away, tell her politely that you've changed your mind, and pay for the first half hour or her driver's fee, plus some money for her time. Don't hurt her feelings or stiff her, unless you'd like being treated that way at your job. 

be as calm as you can, and try to be yourself.  review the laws in your area and make sure you aren't breaking any.  ,  read the escort's ad, website and any additional information she has provided.  make sure you know her phone number and her name.  check her hours before calling.  consider your reasons for calling an escort.  take a deep breath, smile, think of something nice about yourself, and dial.  when she answers, say calmly and confidently, "hi, my name is (whatever).  tell her you saw her ad, and where and that you'd like to talk about making an appointment.  if you have questions about her schedule or general terms, again, make sure you read her website first.  do not ask about possible activities and avoid code words or acronyms.  ask her if she's free at the particular time you want to get together.  be sure to give her your full name, address and phone number or hotel room number.  follow up.  remember that she invests time and money in getting ready, driver and/or security fees, and reserving her time for you.  have fun, be a gentleman, and be safe!  

 Understanding the purpose and philosophy behind the raw food diet is an essential part of becoming an advocate for and ensuring that you are enjoying it, as well as benefiting from it. There are some well-known advocates of the raw food diet you can begin by reading about, and there are numerous websites available to read.   Search online for relevant websites. Useful search terms include: "living foods", raw food diet, natural raw foods, raw, sprouting, dehydrator, juicing, blender, vita-mix, healing, enzymes, organic or raw food recipe, etc.; , Either borrow or purchase quality raw food diet books to learn as much as you can. Many raw food recipe books will also include historical backgrounds, nutritional analysis, and philosophical underpinnings along with the recipes. Good books to begin with include:   Dr. Ruthann Russo's The Raw Food Lifestyle, which includes a practical diet plan and tips on how to make the switch to raw living.Dr. T. Colin Campbell's The China Study includes alternative sources of protein., Join a local potluck or start one of your own. It's wonderful to share food with others. Online forums provide a great resource to meet fellow raw foodists, exchange recipes and have questions answered. And there are a number of raw foodists using Twitter and Facebook to exchange messages, meeting events, and ideas that can spark your own knowledge and expand your group of raw food friends.   Look for raw food festivals, get-togethers, cafes, and un-cooking classes.  If you're concerned that you don't necessarily agree with the rationale for eating raw food all the time, the best advice is to give it a good shot.You'll only know if eating raw food works for you if you try it and see how it makes you feel. Some suggestions for transitioning to a whole or partial raw food diet include:Don't agonize over the decision. Pondering the worth of raw foods from an intellectual point of view can be something you allow to bubble away at the back of your mind rather than serving as a hurdle to stop you from beginning at all. Moreover, what matters is how you feel on such a diet; you can gradually come to terms with the nutritional science as you proceed (subject to the warnings outlined below). Be flexible. It might be that you prefer to eat a partially raw diet for a length of time before advancing to a completely raw diet. In some cases, you may never fully transition to a wholly raw food diet but might mix it with 60 percent raw food and 40 percent vegan cooked food, for example.The need for freshness, unprocessed foods, and organic sources remains pertinent however you choose to mix it. Trust your taste buds. If your head is bothering you with the whys and wherefores, trust your taste buds first. They'll reassure you that raw foods are delicious. Appreciate the ease of preparation. Many raw foods are easy to prepare provided you select the right recipes. Indeed, sometimes there is no need to bother with recipes at all, but just prepare the foods simply and enjoy them in their raw state as salads or in their own right as a snack. Find recipes that don't ask for exotic ingredients that are hard to find. You'll give up easily if you feel that you have to trek across town or order online just to get hold of strange ingredients. An occasional use of these might be called for, but keep most of your daily eating requirements to the ingredients that you can easily source locally.  Quality kitchen equipment makes following a raw food diet much easier and less time-consuming. Look for items that are simple, affordable, easy to clean, and will do the range of things needed. When preparing raw food, typical preparation techniques include cutting into chunks, chopping coarsely or finely, dicing, mincing, slivering, julienne, shredding, grating, tearing, and chiffonade. As a raw foodist, you'll benefit from using these helpful "must-haves":    Sharp knives are essential, along with good cutting boards (either the more easily sanitized plastic boards, well maintained wooden boards, or - preferably - sustainably-farmed bamboo boards). A food processor can be very useful. A food processor is excellent for chopping and mixing various foods. A dehydrator removes moisture from food and thus preserves it for longer term storage. A blender. Ani Phyo also recommends a Vita-Mix.Juicers are an excellent and easy way to incorporate more fruits and vegetables into a diet. Use sparingly with fruit, as it is better to eat fruit than to drink it. Experiment with a solar oven.A solar oven uses minimal heat to preserve more nutrients. It can be used with a variety of dishes to make satisfying and delicious patties, hot and cold soup, dips, crackers, etc.  When switching to a raw food diet, the source of your food is important. Organic food is unburdened by the chemicals used for conventional crops. Even though the scientific arguments continue to rage over the benefits of organic versus conventionally grown from a nutrient perspective, it's hard to argue with the fact that placing undue chemical burdens onto the environment is harming our environment, given that foods grown with excessive chemical loads are depleting soils, fouling up rivers and seas, and have questionable residues from pesticides on many of our foods. Ways to help yourself include:   Grow your own food. Experiment with sprouting seeds and herbs. A sunny window sill can be a good source of fresh food all year round. Make your own compost. Your food will contain more nutrients. Try a compost bin or a worm composter. Buy the most important organic produce when possible. If price is a factor for you, at least purchase the organic foods most recommended for eating organic as the basis of a healthy diet. Some crops are more heavily sprayed and intensively raised than others — this is where doing your own research comes in handy. Learn about the "Dirty Dozen," i.e. the foods that carry the highest load of pesticides and should be organic whenever possible, at this website., There is a wide range of food available to the raw foodist, contrary to scoffing by those who dismiss the diet. What you will be losing is processed food but that's a bonus, not a problem! At least 75 percent of food consumed should not be heated over 118ºF or 48ºC. What you can eat are unprocessed, preferably organic, whole foods such as:   Fresh fruits and vegetables – make sure it's the freshest and organic where possible. Always have a good variety of greens, root vegetables, and fresh herbs in your fridge. Nuts and seeds – always have two jar-sprouted items in your fridge at any one time and always have sunflower sprouts available. Keep a jar of almonds soaking in the fridge for ready use (change the water every day, for up to 5 days).Seed and nut butters are also important in a raw food diet.  Beans, grains, and legumes. Make sure you are choosing sprouted beans and legumes — they are tough to digest otherwise. Dried fruit such as dates, raisins, cranberries, goji berries, pineapple, coconut, apricot, mangoes, apples, etc., make a great selection. Dates make excellent sweeteners for raw food desserts. Fresh and dried herbs and spices – these add the flavoring variety to your food. Salts – these can bring mineral nutrients to your diet if you use sea salt, miso or nama shoyu, Bragg Liquid Aminos, or Himalayan salt. Oils – be sure to source your oil from a reputable place, and choose virgin cold-pressed olive oil, refrigerated flax oil, and refrigerated hemp oil. Vinegar – apple cider vinegar is considered to be the best because it is high in malic acid, aiding the digestion of proteins.Seaweed – this brings a wide range of minerals into your diet and lignans (anti-cancer properties). Look for hijiki, dulse flakes, nori sheets, and wakame. Young coconut milk. Cocoa and carob – choose both from quality sources, organic, and store in airtight containers for freshness. Raw food pate – this is a great standby to always have on hand for immediate eating.  Sauerkraut – make your own from cabbage or other vegetables for a long-term, fridge item that is healthy and spices up many raw food meals.For raw omnivores and carnivores, eggs, fish (sushi, sashimi), meat, milk and dairy products (non-pasteurized/non-homogenized) may also be included. 

become informed about the raw food diet.  read books on raw food diets.  find community.  try it.  acquire the appropriate kitchen equipment.  consider the source of your food.  know which foods form part of a raw food diet.

 Cosmetic mica powder is a fine mineral powder that is available online, in beauty supply stores and even in some specific super stores.   Mica powder come in a huge variety of colors, with or without shimmer and in diverse quantity sizes. Although you can use a single color of mica powder to make your eyeshadow, you can make more unique and unusual shades by blending a number of different mica powders together. Be sure to purchase only mica powder that is for cosmetic use and safe to use near your eyes.; , To make a simple loose powder eyeshadow, you simply need to blend a selection of mica powders until you get your preferred shade.          For example, if you wanted to make a warm autumn-themed shade you could mix light brown, dark brown, gold, cream and orange mica powders. If you wanted a shimmering, aquamarine color, you could mix blue, green and silver mica powders. To get a consistent color, you will need to measure out equal amounts of each mica powder. To do this, you can use the .15cc pigment scoop that is often provided with the mica powders, or even a small measuring spoon. It doesn't matter what quantity of each powder you use, as long as you use equal amounts. Place the powders in an empty lip balm container (you can wash out an old one or buy online) and mix well to combine. Some people like to use a small herb or coffee grinder to do this, but you can also just use a spoon. Make sure to screw the lid on tightly when you're done, you don't want the powder to spill!  , To make a pressed powder eyeshadow (like the ones in an eyeshadow palette) you will need to follow the same process as described for the loose powder eyeshadow, before completing a few extra steps:          Once you have mixed your mica powders to create your chosen shade, you will need to add a powder binder -- these usually come in spray or liquid form and can be purchased online. Add the powder binder to the mica mixture drop by drop (or spray by spray) and mix well until it achieves the consistency of wet sand. Transfer the wet powder to an empty lip balm container, then place a piece of paper towel directly over the shadow and place a coin on top (it can be any coin, but try to match it to the size of the container). Slowly press down on the coin so the shadow under it becomes compacted. Do this until the entire top of the shadow has been pressed. Leave the shadow out on a counter, covered with a sheet of paper towel, until the powder is entirely dry. Once it's dry, your pressed eyeshadow is ready to use!, Making a cream shadow using mica powders is a slightly more complicated process, which requires several additional ingredients. However, you can achieve a more intense color using this method.          To make this cream eyeshadow, you will need: 8 white beeswax pastilles, 1 teaspoon of refined shea butter, 24 drops of refined jojoba oil, 120 drops vegetable glycerin, 12 drops of vitamin E oil and 2 1/4 teaspoons of mica powder (a single color or a combination). Add the shea butter and beeswax to a small bowl and microwave for a minute or two until melted. Using a separate 3ml plastic pipette for each ingredient, add the drops of jojoba oil, vegetable glycerin, and vitamin E oil to the bowl. Add the mica powder to the bowl and mix well to combine all of the ingredients until you achieve a uniform consistency. Transfer the creamy mixture to an empty lip balm container, tightly replace the lid and wait 24 hours before using. 

buy a selection of mica powders.  make a loose powder eyeshadow.  make a pressed powder eyeshadow.  make a cream eyeshadow. 

 Learning assertiveness and the finesse of pointing out the harmful, critical patterns of others in a loving and productive way is in an important step toward dealing with put downs. Cultivate power by standing up for yourself and altering the environment to prevent future put-downs.   Being assertive is different than being aggressive. Try speaking clearly and maintaining eye contact while being a receptive listenerCommunicating assertively can help increase self confidence, gain the respect of others, improve decision-making skills, and enable conflict resolution.; , Often people are too different to be able to see eye to eye. You will come across many people who don't make you feel particularly good to be around, and others will feel the same way about you. The key is to see that, even though not all people are meant to be friends, this does not make you or the other person bad. Incompatibility is just another part of life that we can learn to respond to with grace or with defensiveness and cruelty. When somebody puts you down, it's about that person and not you. Here are the top reasons people might criticize you:   They are threatened by your competence, attractiveness, etc. so they are trying to level the playing field. They have a concern about your motivation, skill level, performance or contribution. They feel you are not doing your share of the work or being a team player. They have a strong unmet need that is not being satisfied. They have a controlling personality and have to be in charge. They feel entitled to special treatment or status and do not feel they are receiving it. They want to make you look bad so as to advance their own position or curry favor with the bosses, etc. They feel insecure and are overcompensating. They think you are making them look bad in front of others.  When we feel hurt or put down, it is easy to take the position of the victim and assume there’s nothing we can do to change these bad feelings. Seeing that there are always choices you can make to improve your situation, try to think about your options for responding and your approach moving forward.For instance, if a peer at school consistently puts you down, remember that you always have the choice to ignore that person entirely. If you feel that this is not the best way to handle the problem, think about who can get involved to help you assert your desire for some distance. In a public forum, such as a meeting, you may want to argue for the value of your decision or work and correct any misperceptions. With family or friends, you may want to let them know that you genuinely want to understand their concerns, but that you don't always agree. Depending on the situation, you may want to assert yourself by saying, "Let's agree to disagree."With aggressive children or teenagers, you may want to acknowledge that their feeling is legitimate, but that they need to work on a more respectful delivery.  If you've just been put down, you probably feel embarrassed, upset, or filled with a sense of injustice. While these feelings shouldn't be denied, see that they also offer you paths besides feeling stuck in them.View the put down as a learning experience that is giving you practice for how to be more resilient in the face of whatever comes.   After all, life is full of situations that we wouldn't necessarily choose, and the way we respond to these situations is the difference between ruminating in sadness and getting excited about how much hurt you can learn to let go of Understand what happened on your own terms. Ask yourself, according to your own values: What went well? What didn’t go well? What can I do better next time?Try practicing mindfulness in the moment. It can be helpful to remove yourself from the hurt emotions and take a moment to ask what the put downs say about the other person.  It is much easier to look realistically at what has happened to us and where we can go from the put-down when we drop thoughts that skew our thoughts into exaggerated, negative evaluations of our situations. The following are some examples ways of thinking that make it difficult to see the reality of our situation:Fortune telling is when we assume that things will turn out badly without having any real basis for this prediction. Black-and-white thinking is when we only look at things in terms of extreme judgments. In black-and-white thinking everything is either good or bad (even if reality tells us that things are too complicated for this sort of judgment). Mind-reading is when we think we know what others are thinking (and it’s usually the worst about us!) In reality, we can’t know what others are thinking. Labelling is when we choose a simple label like “stupid” or “ugly” to describe a behavior, situation, or person that is much too complex to be summed up in just one word. Labels are usually negative and make us forget the other aspects in play.  It is easy to ask yourself, "Why me?" in tough situations. Getting stuck in the "why me" mindframe can make it hard to see the lessons that always come with hardships. Seek meaning by changing "Why me?" questions to questions like "What do I now see about why and how some people put others down?" or "What can I do to play a role in stopping the cruelty that I have experienced?"   The most resilient people come up with constructs about their suffering, ways to see the message that they are receiving about life through their suffering. This is means the situation is meaningful despite being uncomfortable., In many situations, the putdown that you hear will have very little to do with who you are and what happened in reality. In these cases the put down may not even be worth gratifying with serious consideration about the incident or what you could have done differently.   Think about the absurdity of judging yourself based on one single instance. It doesn't make much sense to think that one slip-up or one person's opinion of you should factor into your sense of who you are, does it? Try laughing about the fact that you are much more complex than one putdown could possibly capture.  There are so many things that we cannot control, including others’ decisions. So, bouncing back can be made easier by rediscovering your ability to have a positive impact.Work on something that you can control, like an art project or a challenging new assignment at work or in school. Observe yourself being dedicated to something (and rocking it!) to remember that you are capable of contributing lots of good to the world around you.  Friends, family, and other supportive relationships in your life are very important to your ability to bounce back from putdowns. Make sure that you have people in your life who will listen to you speak freely about painful experiences without judgment.   Keep your support system close, even when these people are not with you physically. When you feel kicked around by the world, think about these people. What do they show you about the good in your personality? How does it feel to be around them? Then, you can be the person you are when you're around them even in their absence.  If you are being put down time and time again by the same person or group of people, you may be a dealing with bullying. Bullying is a serious offense, and it's important to reach out to your teachers, parents, or counselors who can help put an end to the problem. The following are signs that you are being bullied and should seek help:The put down involves actions like making threats, spreading rumors, launching physical or verbal attacks, and purposeful exclusion. The person bullying you has power over you, like physical strength, popularity, or access to information that can be used to harm or embarrass you. The behavior happens more than once and has the potential to continue.  If you are trying to love yourself more, shame is one of your worst enemies--it tells you that simply being you is something fundamentally bad or wrong.Since shame is usually directed toward the parts of you that you try to hide, writing about your deeper feelings (even the ones that make you embarrassed or disgusted) can help you come to understand that there is nothing wrong with what's inside. When you journal, write about the difficulties and pains that you encountered throughout the day, including things you judged yourself about.For each painful moment or event, practice re-framing the experience through a lens of compassion. Think about what you learned from what happened and be generous to yourself regarding how you acted, knowing that you have plenty of opportunities to respond differently. Try writing in a journal each day for a couple weeks to get comfortable with your own perspective. You might be surprised when you read back over your entries--look at this inquisitive, sensitive person who must've been writing!  , In a world so focused on progress and improvement, we can easily forget the importance of accepting the things about ourselves that we cannot change. You have unique gifts and shortcomings that make you who you are. Acceptance of yourself and your feelings, rather than forcefully shutting them out, can help you to work with what you have. This will help you discover who you are and what you're truly capable of (and not just what you think you should be capable of).   Acceptance has been shown to contribute directly to self-love by reducing the shame that tells us that we are not good enough or that we would be more desirable people if we could feel and act otherwise.One thing that everyone must accept is that the past cannot be changed or overwritten. Since this is the case, focus on the future--what you do have control over is how you learn from and respond to the situations that you find yourself in currently.  Strong values are help fill our lives with meaning that is personal to us. This is because knowing your values offers you ways to understand what's happening around you.Your values will also clue you in to the put downs that matter to you in the grand scheme, and let you know when these setbacks are just insignificant bouts of negativity that can be ignored.   For example, say your values prioritize celebrating accomplishments and you go out to a restaurant with friends to celebrate a promotion. If you get some eye-rolls from neighboring tables for wearing party hats and glitter, who cares? You are acting according to your values and not others' standards for proper celebratory behavior.  Are you on top of the habits that contribute to your overall lifestyle? Pay attention to the things that are very important but easily slip through the cracks, and take care of yourself as if you are caring for a loved one (because you are!).   Do you eat well? Ask yourself whether or not you have consistent means to provide yourself with nutrient-rich foods that your body needs. How much sleep are you getting? Do you frequently feel tired during the day due to lack of steady sleeping habits? What about exercise? Getting 30 minutes of brisk cardiovascular exercise each day improves mood, overall functioning, and reduces risk of chronic illnesses.  Spend time by yourself learning what you like to do or fostering hobbies and interests that you already have. Seek out your passions and talents and dedicate a certain amount of time doing what you love each week. Maybe your thing is writing short stories or cooking the meals your mom used to make when you were young. By simply reconnecting with your favorite activities you make your world a little more accommodating to your deeper needs that are easily overlooked when work, school, and other duties stress you out.  In our fast paced world, relaxation is hard to come by--and all the more important because of its rare occasion. When you intentionally take steps to relax, you are giving yourself a great gift and affirming to yourself that you deserve this break at the same time. The following are some tools you can learn in order to put together an effective relaxation regime for whenever you should need it:   Mindfulness meditation Yoga Deep breathing Progressive muscle relaxation  

respond with finesse.  accept reality.  take stock of your choices.  learn to re-frame your current situation.  check your thinking for negativity traps.  seek meaning from put downs.  laugh off the put down.  shift your focus to something you can control.  seek social support.  know when to seek outside help.  shed shame.  work on self-acceptance.  develop your values.  take responsibility for your general well-being.  focus on your interests.  learn to relax. 

 Dust your rugs and carpets evenly with baking soda. Use as much as you deem necessary, depending on the smell’s strength. For a quick job, allow the baking soda to absorb odors for at least a quarter of an hour (or longer if you have the time) before vacuuming. For a more thorough freshening, declare the area off-limits for the next 24 hours and then vacuum it the following day.  Dust the bottom of your garbage can and/or the inside of your trash liner to counteract stinky garbage. Rinse the old baking soda out with each change of the bag and reapply.Be careful not to set the old garbage bag on your floor, since it will be powdered with baking soda. However, you can clean your floor easily with a wipe of a cloth or a quick vacuum, so don’t stress out too much about it.  Alternately, you can leave a full opened box of baking soda at the bottom of the can to avoid messy bag-changes.  Dust the bottom of the tray with baking soda for additional odor-absorption. Then fill it with your store-bought cat litter. Alternately, you can create your own litter by filling the tray with three inches of sandy clay and then stirring in an 8-ounce box of baking soda. For especially strong odors, use a 16-ounce box., Shake some baking soda over your wet pet to reduce “wet fur” and other smells when you don’t have time to give them a full bath with shampoo. Keep it light to avoid startling them with a thick cloud, or simply pour some in your palm and rub it into their fur if that is easier. Work it in with your fingers so it can trap the odors. Then use your pet’s brush to comb the baking soda out. 

deodorize your carpets.  minimize the smell of garbage.  freshen your cat litter.  freshen your cat or dog.

 When levitating a card, you would face the deck of cards so that the audience sees the front of the cards.   Hold the deck of cards so that your index finger is behind the deck of cards, hidden from the audience. Simply use your index finger to lift the back card (the one closest to you) up.It helps to use your other hand to pretend you're "levitating" the card to add to the visual effect. From an audience point of view, it looks like a random card in the middle of the deck is levitating, not the back card.  Get two straws. Take the wrapper about 3/4ths from the top and tear it around so you can take it off, but do not take it off yet.   Rub the majority part of the paper on the straw to create static friction, and quickly take the majority paper off. Absorb the static in your hands by putting the charged straws on them (Note: this will create a positive and negative charge on your hands, which will create force in between them the closer you put your hands together.) Hold the card on one hand, and push the other hand over the card. If done correctly, the card will react to the forces of the charge, and will levitate!  

use your fingers to levitate the card.  make static with straws. 

 The little dog pattern piece leaves a hole in the stomach for you to turn your animal inside out, but you might need to leave your own hole if you are making a different felt animal.  Using the whole you left stuff your animal thoroughly with polyester fiberfill. Make sure the animal is well stuffed but not over stuffed. You want the animal to feel firm without looking like it is going to explode. Use your judgment. , You can add whatever pieces you want. The little dog calls for small beads for eyes and some black string for the mouth and nose. You can add designs all over the felt if you desire though.   The snake embroidery would consist of little sewing on black circles of fabric or string for eyes, and a little piece of red felt for the tongue. Draw a tongue that appeals to you. Most snakes have forked tongues.  This would be the time to add ears, tails, or whatever else your animal might have connected to their body. The little dog will have a tail stitched to the back of his body and two ears connected on top. Remember to turn your body pieces inside out after you sew them to hide the stitching. Follow the letters on your design piece. If you aren’t sure what pieces are added where, look at which letters correspond to what pieces. For example if you are adding ears to the top of a dog there will be the same letter on the ears as on the top of the body piece. Anywhere with matching letters is supposed to be connected with stitching.  

turn your animal inside out.  stuff your animal.  add your embroidery.  stich up your final body pieces. 

 A common cycle with bingeing goes something like this: you feel bad, so you eat, which makes you feel bad, so you eat. Instead of beating yourself up for bingeing, treat yourself as you would your best friend, with kindness and understanding.   Counter negative self talk with positive statements. If a voice inside you says “I’m fat,” counter it with “I’m creative” or “I’m smart”, or whatever may apply that makes you feel good about yourself. Treat yourself as you would a child. Would you tell a child that he or she was right if he/she said “I'm fat”? Maybe you would even ask, “What makes you say that?” Opening a dialogue with yourself may help you gain more insight into why you are binge eating. It is important to focus less on the food side of things, and more on your own well-being. The food is likely not the problem. It’s more likely a symptom of something that you are struggling with on an emotional level.  These could include exercising, joining a class at your local community centre, learning a language — really anything that makes you feel good.  Try to write at least three pages each day, being sure to note the days when you feel the urge to binge. Being more in touch with your feelings and urges may help you to “reframe the problem from being one of ‘I’m hungry’ to one of ‘I’m feeling ignored or unimportant’ or whatever it might be, and line up the solutions for that,” according to Doug Bunnell, PhD., Studies have shown that visualization alone can have a measurable affect on the human body.Sit somewhere comfortable, close your eyes, and visualize yourself resisting the temptation to binge. Visualize yourself eating a healthy meal and stopping before you feel sick.We like to be right. Our brains will hold on to what we believe to be true, and will work to prove us right. If we think the world hates us, we will see evidence for that everywhere. If we think we are unhealthy and unworthy, we will do things like binge eat to prove ourselves right. You can reprogram your brain. Visualization and positive self talk help.  You may wish to start with a medical practitioner, who can suggest medications and/or refer you to a therapist and/or support group specializing in eating disorders. For many, therapy will be the ideal route as medications often carry with them drawbacks such as side effects and expense.If you do choose to take medication, combine it with therapy if possible.   There are a number of medications available to help you fight binge eating. These range from antidepressants to prescriptions designed to help with binge eating. As with most medications, there are significant side effects that must be understood, so it would be best to consult with your doctor on the best option for you.  Seek out either a local support group and/or join an online forum in which people openly discuss their struggles with binge eating. The following websites are good starting points, but you may also wish to do an Internet search that includes the city you live in plus the words “binge eating support” or “binge eaters”.    Overeaters AnonymousCompulsive Eaters AnonymousEating Disorder Referral and Information CentreNational Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), Write it down. Be as detailed as possible. The next time you feel the urge to binge, you will know that there’s another option: to follow your plan.   If you find yourself struggling to go through with your plan, promise yourself to at least complete three of the steps before you give in and binge eat. As with many things, the hardest part is often starting. You may find that after three steps, you want to keep going with your plan, and the urge to binge eat might subside.  It is such an important step that it bears repeating. It is not fair to yourself to expect to go from bingeing to healthy eating immediately. Be patient and gentle with yourself. You will likely have good and bad days, and that’s okay. The important thing to remember is that every moment is an opportunity to start fresh. You don't have to wait until tomorrow to try again. Choose to be healthy now.  

have compassion for yourself.  replace food with other pleasurable activities.  keep track of your thoughts, feelings, and urges in a journal.  meditate, visualizing a healthy you.  seek professional help.  join a support group.  plan what you will do the next time the urge to binge strikes.  understand that there is no quick fix. 

 If the pregnancy came as a surprise, you'll need to decide if you want to keep the baby or not. Think about whether you're in a place to raise a child, both physically and financially. If you're not, could you make the necessary changes to care for the child? A child is a big responsibility, emotionally, physically, and financially. While no parent is perfect, you should at least want the responsibility of caring for another human life., Think about whether you would want to raise a child with the father of the baby. Your relationship needs to be mature enough to handle the responsibility of caring for and raising a child.If the father is someone you would considering raising a child with, discuss your pregnancy with them to see how you want to move forward together.   If the father is not around, discuss the pregnancy and your situation with someone who cares about you, such as a parent or a sibling, just to have someone to bounce ideas off of.  If you decide to go through with having the baby, you'll start prenatal care.Prenatal care is basically keeping the baby healthy through regular checkups at the doctor. Your doctor will check on your own health, including screening for sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes, and the health of the baby at your first visit. Your doctor will help you set up a schedule for the rest of your visits., You may decide that you don't want to have the baby, and that's a valid choice. If that's the case, your main option is an abortion, though the morning after pill can work up to five days after you've had sex.Research abortion clinics in your area. They can help you with your options. Keep in mind, though, many states and countries have laws in place that require doctors to tell you certain information, which is intended to discourage you from having an abortion. Don't let it discourage you if an abortion is what you desire - just make sure you are fully aware of all the risks involved in having an abortion. Some states may require an ultrasound before you can have an abortion. Depending on the state, you may need to get your parent's permission if you're under 18.The two main types of abortion in the first trimester are medical and surgical. Don't let the word "surgical" scare you, as it generally doesn't involve any cutting. Usually, a tube or forceps are used to open your cervix, and then a suction action is used.A medical abortion is when a pill is used to induce abortion., If you want to have the baby but feel like you can't raise it yourself, then giving your baby up for adoption can be another option. It is a difficult decision to make, and it is one that is binding, once the papers are signed. If you think this option is for you, begin by reading books about it, researching on the internet, talking to close friends, and talking to an adoption lawyer or an adoption professional.Talk to the father. In many states in the United States, the father has to give his consent before the adoption becomes official. If you are under 18, you need to talk to your parents before making a decision. Decide what kind of adoption you want. You can go through an agency or you can hire a lawyer to arrange an independent adoption outside of an agency. Choose the adoptive parents carefully. You may want a family who raises your child in your faith tradition, or you may want a family that's open to you being in the child's life. Also, in some adoptions, the parents may pay for your prenatal care and other medical expenses.  

decide if you are in a place to raise a child.  discuss it with your partner.  begin prenatal care.  consider if you want to end the pregnancy.  research adoption. 

 To ensure that the oven is hot enough when you’re ready to bake the cookies, it’s important to preheat it. Set the oven to 375 degrees (190 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat.Keep an eye on your oven so you know when it’s fully preheated. Most ovens will usually beep or flash a light to alert you.; , For the cookies, you’ll need 1 to 2 large cookie sheets. Line the sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats to prevent the cookies from sticking during baking. Set them aside until you’re ready to bake the cookies.You can get away with using only one cookie sheet, but you will likely need to bake multiple batches of cookies. If you don’t have parchment paper or silicone baking mats, you can grease your cookie sheets with nonstick cooking spray or butter.  Use a handheld or stand mixer to combine 1 ¼ cups (284 g) of softened, unsalted butter, 1 cup (200 g) of packed dark brown sugar, and 1 cup (200 g) of granulated sugar in a large bowl. Blend the ingredients on medium speed until the mixture is light and fluffy.If you don’t have a handheld or stand mixer, you can mix the butter and sugars together by hand. It will take a little more time and effort, though, so you may want to allow the butter to soften longer to make the process easier.  When the butter and sugars are creamed together, add 1 large egg, 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of pure vanilla extract, and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of dark molasses to the bowl. Continue mixing the ingredients on medium until they’re fully combined, and then set the mixture aside for a moment.As you add the egg, vanilla, and molasses, scrape down the sides of the bowl if necessary to ensure that the ingredients are all well mixed.  In a medium bowl, mix 1 ½ cups (180 g) of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon (5 g) of baking soda, ½ teaspoon (3 g ) of salt, and ¾ teaspoon (2 g) of ground cinnamon together with a wooden spoon. When the ingredients are fully blended, add 3 cups (249 g) of uncooked, quick-cooking oats and stir until they’re fully incorporated.You can also mix in ¼ teaspoon (.5 g) of ground cloves with the cinnamon if you want to add some extra spice to the cookies. Make sure that you use quick-cooking oats for the cookies, not whole-rolled oats.  When you’ve completely mixed the dry ingredients, begin to add them little by little to the wet ingredients on a low speed. The cookie batter will be extremely thick, so you will probably need to mix it by hand several times after using the electric mixer to ensure that the ingredients are fully combined., When the cookie batter is completely mixed, use a large cookie scoop to drop the dough onto the prepared baking sheets. Each ball of dough should measure approximately 2 tablespoons (30 g).The cookies spread while baking, so make sure to place them at least 2-inches (5-cm) apart on the cookie sheet.  Place the cookie sheet(s) in the preheated oven, and allow the cookies to bake until the edges become lightly golden. In most cases, that will take approximately 10 minutes., Once the cookies have golden brown edges, remove them from the oven. Let them cool on the baking sheets for 3 to 4 minutes before transferring them to a wire cooling rack. Allow them to cool completely, which should take approximately 15 minutes.It’s important to ensure that the cookies are completely cool before you begin assembling the oatmeal cream pies. If they are still warm, the cream filling may melt.  Add ¾ cup (170 g) softened unsalted butter to a large bowl, and use a handheld or stand mixer to beat the butter on medium-high for approximately 5 minutes. You want the butter to lighten in color and become fluffy so the cream will be light and smooth., Once the butter is light and fluffy, turn your mixer speed to low and gradually add 2 ½ cups (313 g) of confectioners’ sugar. Mix the ingredients until the sugar is fully incorporated.Confectioners’ sugar is also known as powdered sugar or icing sugar.  When the confectioners’ sugar is completely blended with the butter, add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of pure vanilla extract and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of heavy cream with the mixer still set at a low speed. Blend the mixture until all of the ingredients are fully incorporated.You can substitute half-and-half or whole milk for the heavy cream, but the cream filling will probably not be as creamy.  When the ingredients are all fully incorporated, turn the mixer’s speed back up to medium-high. Beat the cream filling for 3 to 5 more minutes, or until it has a light, fluffy consistency.If the cream filling is too stiff or thick, you can add in more heavy cream. Mix it in 1 teaspoon (5 ml) at a time until you reach the proper consistency.  When the filling is ready, arrange half of the cookies so they’re upside down. Use a knife or spoon to spread 1 to 1 ½ tablespoons of the cream filling across the cookies.The amount of filling that you should add depends on the size of the cookie. You want to spread the filling nearly all the way to the edges, so a larger cookie requires more cream.  After you’ve spread the cream filling over the cookies, use the other half of the cookies to create the pies. Press them down over the filling rightside up to create sandwiches.It’s okay if some of the filling is squeezed out the edges when you press the cookies together.  If you’re not eating the oatmeal cream pies right away, place them in an airtight container. You can leave them out at room temperature for up to two days, or place them in refrigerator for up to 5 days.If you’re storing the cream pies in the refrigerator, be sure to leave them out at room temperature for an hour or so before eating.  

preheat the oven.  prepare the cookie sheets.  cream the butter and sugars together.  mix in the egg, vanilla, and molasses.  combine the dry ingredients.  slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients.  place the dough on the cookie sheet with a scoop.  bake the cookies until they are lightly golden.  cool the cookies on a wire rack.  beat the butter for several minutes.  add the powdered sugar to the butter.  mix in the vanilla extract and cream.  beat the mixture for several more minutes.  spread some of the filling over half of the cookies.  place the remaining cookies on top to create sandwiches.  store the cream pies in an airtight container. 

 With a preteen's new hormones, body development, the new pressure to fit in, more bullying and peer pressure, it's no surprise that they'll likely need some support. Although it might sound like second nature to go to a parent, for a preteen with these new problems it can be difficult to go to a parent, especially if they think they may be judged or punished. However, if the child seems not to want to talk about something, it's not your fault; it can actually be good for them to solve problems on their own. If the child has unexplained scars, marks or bruises; seems sad or upset even when something good happens; shows sign of an eating disorder; or is showing signs that (s)he may be abused, then it's time to step in.Take him\her to a doctor and get rid of the root problem. They will likely be mad, but they'll thank you for it in the future.; , If you stress over it too much she'll think it's a scary, unnatural thing. If you tell every one she might be humiliated. It might be natural, but the fact that it happens from inside her body embarrasses her.  You can expect more responsibility out of them, but don't force responsibility that should be given to a teen or adult unless you are 100% sure that they can handle it and that they don't mind.   What they should do: Turn in schoolwork, study, clean their room etc. What they might have to wait till they are older: Babysitting, taking care of a baby while you sleep etc.  For a preteen, it can be more relaxing than trying to talk to you with everyone else around, and can strengthen the bond.  Nobody wants to be called fat, ugly, bad etc. But do offer positive criticism. Example:   Positive: That's a great top you're wearing. Maybe it would look good with a scarf. Negative: That's an ugly shirt. Try a scarf.  Just because your child is goth doesn't mean they are about to kill themselves.  There is a fine line between being fair and playing favorites. If they are the ones being favored, they might become spoiled or self-centered and may struggle keeping their spot. If they are not being favored, they will have lower self-esteem and be more sensitive. It also puts them at risk for depression.   Playing Favorites: Giving one child more gifts or attention, a less severe punishment even though they did the same thing, giving them different bedtimes even though they are the same age etc. Being Fair: Giving more attention to a much younger child or baby, giving them an earlier bedtime than older siblings, etc  , Don't spoil them but don't be the only person to not give them a present on their birthday. When punishing, do not make it too harsh.  Preteens need privacy just as teens do. But if they are in privacy more than a few hours a day or skipping meals take them to a doctor. It might be a serious problem.  If they get a bad grade, just tell them you're there to help them if they need it. If they accidentally drop your favorite cup, tell them it's okay and you know it's not their fault.  Expecting them to be respectful and responsible is good. Pushing them to become someone else is not.  There's nothing wrong with expecting at least a few A's on a report card. But expecting all A's is setting standards too high; they will struggle often and will think they are not good enough for you.  Parents like this often want the best for their children, but they may end up causing more harm than good. Keep a close eye on them, but allow some freedom. Let them make little decisions once in a while. A good example is to give them an allowance and see if they spend it wisely.  Get messy in the mud, eat ice cream, or just have fun.  

let them know you'll be there for them.  if your preteen girl gets her period, don't make a huge deal out of it.  remember, she is still a kid.  occasionally do things together.  don't criticize your preteen.  don't judge them.  never play favorites.  always be fair.  give them privacy when asked.  don't punish them for accidents.  don't push them into being a different person.  don't set expectations too high.  avoid being an overprotective parent.  occasionally let your inner child out. 

 Some players judge others on their account username, which is not a nice experience for the victim! Pick something unique, not too long. It may not be a good idea to add numbers, but you may if you wish.; , In Roblox, there's many items of clothing to choose from the catalog. Unfortunately, you may not suit everything. Some items depend on gender, personalities, interests, age, etc. Find something that suits you. You can also purchase hats. This also includes hair for both boys and girls. Gear is available and can be found in the catalog also.  Roblox provides a lot of items you can earn, and it's always good to have a few of these items! There's a lot you can earn on Roblox, and here's a few things; Badges, knockouts, friends/friend requests, money (robux, tix), etc. Badges are always a good place to start. Begin by making 20 friends and adding them to your friends list, and you will get the "friendship" badge. Next, I'd recommend going for the CI (Combat Initiation) badge. You must gain at least 10 victories (kills/knockouts, I believe). Go to a game and "pwn" someone at least 10 times. Once you've earned these badges, you should go for 100 knockouts and earn the "warrior badge". This shouldn't be too hard.  If you're interested in Roblox and would like to explore more, I recommend Builders club. For new purchasers, I'd get BC (Basic/normal builders club) or TBC (Turbo builders club/medium builders club). I would only recommend OBC if you're a veteran, because you may get bored of Roblox and you won't want to be wasting money! BC is the cheapest, TBC is in the middle, and OBC is the most expensive one of the three. (BC/TBC/OBC costs real life money). You can earn daily robux with builders club (BC=15 daily, TBC=35 daily, OBC=60 daily).  Everyone has special qualities on ROBLOX. Some are great at graphics designing, clothes designing, owning groups, foruming, making games, etc. Monkrymonkry got famous by a few games, that could be you some day! PaperMousee is into clothes designing along with Jalki, BlueJuice, and a few others, so most of them are in the fame. We've got a few famous group owners and successful graphic designers, some are really famous forumers, and some with unique hobbies and qualities. Explore your successions and see what you're good at.  If you trade with people and make deals, you'll be known as a successful "LMaD'er". 

get a cool username.  choose your style of clothing.  earn a lot of things.  buy membership/bc.  being successful is the key to fame.  make some money and trade. 

 Many homes have a water shut off behind the refrigerator. Sometimes you need to shut off the water to the entire house. In that case, open a faucet to let the water pressure bleed off. You do not want to continue until the water supply is off.; , It is much easier if you remove the contents (at least the liquids, which make up most of the weight).  In most cases, this will be a white plastic flexible pipe about the thickness of a pencil. The hose will run from the wall or floor to the refrigerator.  This is almost always the source of your leak. You may need to temporarily turn the water back on to find the leak. Remember to turn the water off again before proceeding.  Be sure that your cut is straight and there are no burrs or extra bits of plastic left behind.  The connector is available broadly. The connectors are less than two dollars before shipping. Buy extras because the water hose WILL leak again before you replace the refrigerator. The connect is a "push on" style, so you don't need tools to make the splice.  This is important, because there may be more than one leak. , You are done. Well done.  

turn off the water supply for the ice maker.  pull the refrigerator away from the wall.  find the plastic water hose that brings water into the refrigerator.  inspect the water hose.  cut the water hose with a sharp knife about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) on either side of the leak.  splice the two ends of the water hose with a 5⁄16 inch (0.8 cm) "union connector" that is expressly for this purpose.  turn the water back on and be sure that your splice is watertight.  push the refrigerator back into place.  ,  celebrate saving $100! 

 Your Miniature Schnauzer will need a high-quality food meant for small breed dogs to help him thrive. High-quality foods often list meat (not meat by-products) as the first two ingredients on the label, so read the ingredients before you buy.   Miniature Schnauzers do well with a dry food that has about a 10 to 15% fat content, so you should also check the label’s nutritional information to see if the food is within this range.; , Feeding your miniature Schnauzer two meals per day on a regular schedule will help to encourage good eating habits and it may also help with potty training.You can use the recommended feeding amount listed on your Miniature Schnauzer’s dog food packaging to help you determine how much to feed him at each meal. Take this amount and divide it in half to determine how much food to offer your Miniature Schnauzer at each meal. Try feeding your Miniature Schnauzer one meal in the morning and one in the evening. If you have a puppy, then you will need to feed him three or even four times per day. Check with your veterinarian or a breed expert to be sure.  Your miniature Schnauzer must always have access to plenty of clean, fresh water.Make sure that you keep a bowl of water somewhere that is easy for him to access. For example, you might place his water dish in your kitchen or a few feet away from his bed.   Change his water daily and check it often. Make sure that the water is always fresh and clean. Clean your Miniature Schnauzer’s water dish once per day to keep it hygienic. Try using a stainless steel bowl since they are durable and less likely to harbor bacteria.  All dogs are prone to obesity as well as humans, so it is important to limit your Miniature Schnauzer’s treat foods. Instead of giving your pet table scraps that might make him sick, offer a small portion of something healthy as an occasional treat. Some good examples include:   cooked sweet potato cooked green beans cooked peas fresh blueberries broccoli baby carrots watermelon chunks banana, Some foods can make your Miniature Schnauzer ill and may even kill your dog if he eats them. These foods include:alcohol grapes and raisins walnuts, almonds, pecans, and macadamia nuts onions, garlic, and chives foods that contain caffeine and chocolate avocados foods that contain yeast foods that contain xylitol 

choose a high-quality dry dog food for little dogs.  feed your miniature schnauzer two meals per day.  provide lots of clean, fresh water.  give your miniature schnauzer some healthy treats.  steer clear of toxic human foods.

 It might be scary or intimidating, but put all of your thoughts and feelings on the table. If you really like this boy, tell her. If he’s hinted or flat out told you that he returns those feelings, tell her. While it may hurt your friend at first, it will feel worse if she feels like you’ve lied or left her in the dark.This is especially important if this is a very close friend that you share everything with. If you start a relationship with this guy secretly, she will automatically be distrustful or resentful of it, and you could really hurt her feelings.; , When you have a crush on someone and the feeling is returned, it feels pretty awesome; however, try to imagine or remember what it’s like when those feelings aren’t returned. Recognize that your friend may feel really down in the dumps, and take care not to gloat or shove your happiness in her face.When you are with her, remember that it's okay to talk about your crush, but don't let him be the only thing you talk about. If she is hurt the crush might be a sore topic.  You need to decide this before going into the conversation. It’s entirely up to you to decide how to proceed in this situation. You can tell her that you really like this guy, you want to date him, but you won’t go forward with it unless you have her blessing. Alternatively, you can tell her that you plan on pursuing a relationship with him, and you’d like her support.   Evaluate the consequences (both good and bad) of dating your crush before you decide what to do. Think about how this might impact your relationship with your friend, and if you like this guy enough to risk straining, harming, or even ending your friendship. Is this just a casual crush or someone you can see getting serious with? Think about your friend's personality — does she have a hard time moving on from things? Is she the type who would see this as a betrayal, or be sad for a little while and then bounce back?Weigh the pros and cons of pursuing this relationship so you can go into the conversation with your friend with eyes wide open. If you tell your friend that you will not date him unless she’s comfortable with it, you need to stick to that. Keep in mind that if your friend disapproves of your relationship, it can cause a major strain on it.At the end of the day, it is your life. If you want to date your crush with or without your friend’s approval, you can; however, you should be prepared for the consequences to your friendship. You can still be caring toward your friend even if you decide to date your crush without her approval. You could say, “I really care about you and our friendship, and I’m excited about possibly dating John. I hope that you can eventually be happy for me. I will not let my dating life get in the way of our friendship.”  , Whether she is angry, upset, or jealous, she is still your friend. You do not have to change your plans based on her emotions, and you do not have to agree with everything she says, but you should be a kind person.Remember, she is probably hurt that her crush has chosen you. Be gentle, honest, and loving while she heals from rejection.   This is particularly important if she’s been a long-term, loyal friend. Your crush may be really great, but your friend is too. It’s OK (and human!) to want relationships with both, but take care not to neglect your friend for this guy.  If you’ve told your friend how you feel, you might as well clue him in too. While sometimes a crush consists of flirting and subtle hints, it will make the situation easier on everyone if you know where your crush stands.For example, there’s no need to do damage control on your friendship if you discover he likes someone else!   Once both of your feelings are out in the open, you are able to decide how to proceed.  In other words, don’t betray your friend by blabbing to your crush about her. She may like him and she may be hurt — but that doesn’t mean he needs to know that. Talk to your crush about your own feelings, and let your friend keep hers private if she wishes.Your friend will be hurt and embarrassed if she discovers you’ve been airing her dirty laundry to a boy she has feelings for.   A good rule of thumb is to simply speak for yourself. Talk only about your own feelings and desires, not anyone else’s.  If the feelings are mutual and you want to proceed with a relationship, take your time. Let your friend adjust to the idea of you two being together before you change your Facebook status and start bringing him as a date to everything. A slow and steady start can make for a healthy, solid relationship, too.That doesn’t mean you need to lie to your friend and pretend that things aren’t happening with your crush. It just means letting her cope with the situation at a slower pace. If your crush doesn’t respect or understand your need to take things slowly, he may not be the right guy for you after all.  Just because your friend has given her approval, that probably doesn’t mean she wants to see you holding hands or kissing all the time. Respect her enough to keep your PDA and pet names to a minimum in her presence. If you want to call your boyfriend Hot Lips and sit on his lap in private, that’s your prerogative. Your friend doesn’t need to see that though. On that note, your friends who never had a crush on him probably don’t want to see that either, so keep the PDA to a minimum., Don’t neglect your friend in order to spend all your time with this boy. A new relationship can be exciting, and it’s easy to want to spend all your time with your crush; however, you need to show your friend that you value your friendship and aren’t going anywhere.If your friend tries to pull away because of hurt feelings, give her space but let her know that you cherish your friendship. You “won” the guy, so be loving and gracious with your friend., Until she’s solidly moved on, just bite your tongue when it comes to that kind of conversation. It will only seem like you’re rubbing her face in your good fortune, and it could make her resentful. Enjoy your relationship privately, and separate it from your friendship — at least for awhile.  

be honest about the situation.  put yourself in her shoes.  tell her what you plan to do.  respect your friend’s emotions.  tell your crush your feelings.  keep the situation with your friend private.  take things slow.  be discreet with your actions.  nurture your friendship.  wait until she’s moved on to “gush.” if your new boyfriend sends you a dozen roses and writes you a sonnet, it’s only natural to want to spill all the details to your friend; however, you should just wait. 

 When girls are at the mall, they’re engulfed in a world of fashion so they will be more likely to check out what you’re wearing. Make sure you come to the mall dressed in a stylish outfit that accents your best features. Wear something that is your style, but make sure not to wear anything that has lots of stains or looks dirty.Wear a shirt color that matches or complements your eye color. This will help accentuate your eyes and make them pop. Classic pants like dark denim or khaki are a good option to appear stylish.; , Before approaching a girl at the mall you want to make sure you look your best. Head to the bathroom to check out how you look. Make sure you don’t have any food on your mouth or shirt. Use a brush or your fingers to brush your hair and smooth over any stray hairs that might be sticking out.  One way to get a girl to remember you is to wear a hint of scent on your body. Use one spritz of cologne or perfume to give yourself a subtle scent that will stay on the girl’s mind. Make sure you don’t put on too much or she might be turned off. Stick to one to two sprays max.  Using eye contact to flirt with a girl is a great way to get her paying attention to you. Play an eye flirting game.Glance in her direction and wait for her to look over at you. When she does, turn away and look at something else. Do the same thing again, but this time wait a little longer before turning away. Continue until it’s obvious you’re looking at her and then go up to talk to her. Say something like, “Hi, I just had to come talk to you. I could see how beautiful your eyes are from all the way over there.”  , If you see a girl your want to pick up in a store, try going up to her and asking for fashion advice. Grab a shirt off the rack and approach her with it. Hold it up to your face and ask her if she thinks it looks good with your eyes. Saying something like this will make her think you appreciate her knowledge and get her to look you in the eyes. Once she gives her answer you can continue the conversation. Try saying “Thanks. Wow, you have beautiful eyes. I bet everything in this store would look good with your eyes!”, A great way to pick up a girl at the mall is to be upfront and approach her directly. Directly telling a girl that you find her attractive can be intimidating, but it can also be very rewarding.Go up to her and say something like, “I’m sorry to interrupt you, but I just had to come over here to tell you how beautiful you are. You light up this entire room with your beauty!" When you approach her directly, be calm and just act like yourself. If you feel awkward, say that. You could tell her, “Hey, I feel awkward saying this, but I wanted to tell you that I think you are incredibly beautiful.”  , If the girl you want to pick up is with a group of friends, approach the entire group first and then speak directly to her.You could say, “Excuse me ladies, sorry to interrupt your fun, but I just had to come over here to introduce myself to your friend.” Then, say your approach line to the girl you want to pick up. Next say, “Hi, I’m Matt and I just needed to come tell you that you light up this entire mall with your smile. You must have a beautiful soul because you radiate with beauty.”  , When you approach a girl, she may be a little suspicious at first, so don’t immediately ask her for her number or give her yours. Let the approach lead you to a conversation with her. Talk to her for a while so that she’ll feel comfortable and get to know you a bit. She’ll be more likely to want to see you again if she feels like she knows you a bit., One of the best ways to seal the deal and get a girl’s phone number is to be confident and calm the entire time you are talking to her. If you are really anxious or self conscious, the girl will pick up on it, get a negative vibe from you, and most likely not give you her number. If you feel nervous, take a deep breath and try to fake the confidence. Imagine you’re just talking to a friend instead of a girl you like., At the end of your conversation, ask if you can exchange numbers with the girl to possibly see her again. Ask her to enter her number in your phone and you can to the same with hers, or you can call or send a quick text so your number is on her phone.Say something like, “I’m sorry to end this, but I have to be going. I’ve really enjoyed talking to you, and I’d love to do it again sometime. Let’s exchange numbers so we can meet up for coffee sometime.”  , The great thing about picking up a girl at the mall is that you don’t have to go far to have a first mini date. After talking to a girl for a bit, go out on a limb and ask her if she’d like to join you for coffee or lunch at a place in the mall. Tell her you want to hear more about her and would love to buy her a coffee.  

wear a stylish outfit.  look at yourself in the mirror.  wear a signature scent.  flirt with your eyes.  ask her for fashion advice.  approach her directly.  address her friends.  make conversation first.  be confident in yourself.  ask to exchange numbers.  invite her to coffee at the mall.

Regularly practice the exercises that help to treat sciatica post-recovery including crunches and leg stretches.  

avoid heaving lifting.  stay in shape.  avoid pressure on the back and legs.  maintain exercises and therapy. 

 The cooler temperatures associated with the autumn months result in less plant growth. As a result, plants do not need to be watered as frequently in the fall as they do in the spring and summer. Check plants before watering them, to determine if they need water. Look at and touch the soil to see if it is dry. Typically dry soil is light in colour. Water the entire root area until water begins to drain out the bottom of the pot.In the autumn you will likely only need to water your container garden one to two times per week., Although it is important to select plants that can handle frost, you can also take some added steps to further protect your container garden from frost damage. There are a number of things that can be done to avoid frost damage in the fall. Try out these tips to ensure your container garden stays healthy:   Place the container in a sheltered area: At night, if there is frost in the forecast, you should move your containers into a sheltered place. For example, move into the corner of the front porch so that it is protected from the wind. Bring containers inside at night. If there is a sustained cold period, you may want to bring the containers in at night. This will protect your plants from the elements. Raise containers off the ground. For example, you can purchase a container that has pot feet, or place the container on bricks. This will aid with drainage and can help prevent the pot from cracking in the cold weather.Place a sheet or fabric over the plants. If you are experiencing a cold snap, you can give your plants added protection by covering them with an old sheet or piece of fabric., You should situate container gardens in an area that gets as much sunlight as possible during the shortened fall days. This will help to keep your plants healthy and green for longer. Do not keep the planter under a covered porch and in the shade all day. This can increase the speed at which the plants become dormant., Although fertilizer is recommended throughout the spring and summer months to help plant growth, it is less important in the autumn. Typically, controlled release fertilizers are impacted by the temperature and as a result not much fertilizer is released for plant use during colder temperatures. Because of this fertilizer is unnecessary.   If you live in a milder climate you may find that fertilizer is necessary in the autumn. Use a water-soluble fertilizer in the autumn because it will be more effective.  

water less in the autumn.  protect your plants from frost damage.  position the containers in as much light as possible.  do not use fertilizer in the autumn. 

 If you’re good with animals, starting a petsitting service can be a good way to get into business. The costs to you are mostly limited to promoting the service by printing out fliers and business cards, and the pay can be decent--$10-$20 for a dog walk, double that for an overnight stay.When you’re advertising your business, start local, especially if you don’t have a car. Post your fliers in community clubhouses, and leave leaflets on people’s doors. Find out more about starting a petsitting business at Start a Pet Sitting Business.  If you’re a little older and you like children, babysitting can be a good way to make money. A teenage babysitter won’t get paid as much as an adult would, but they can still make $10 or more an hour, and even more if there are multiple children involved.If you plan on babysitting for more than six months, you should invest in taking a CPR/First Aid class. Not only will it help you respond to an emergency, you’ll get paid more if you do. You can find a CPR class near you at http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/CPRAndECC/CPR_UCM_001118_SubHomePage.jsp. Again, it’s a good idea to start in your neighborhood. However, a lot of babysitters are older teenagers who have cars, and many parents are willing to provide transportation to the right sitter, so you can advertise more widely within your local area. Find out about starting a babysitting business in detail at Start Your Own Babysitting Business   , Another way to make money is by providing lawn care in your neighborhood. People are often willing to let a neighborhood kid cut their grass, and it will give you a way to get a little extra spending money.The downside to this is that lawn care is hard work. It takes a lot of hours and requires a lot of equipment. On top of everything, people won’t pay a minor the same rate as an adult. Add on the fact that you’re most likely confined to your neighborhood (unless you have transportation), and you'll see it’s hard to make a steady income from it.  Another good neighborhood business to start is washing and detailing cars. You can usually charge at least as much to wash a car as you can to cut grass, it will take about the same amount of time, and you won’t need to buy as much equipment.The downside is, like lawn care, it can be physically demanding and take up a lot of your time.  If you have good grades, you may be able to get a job tutoring other students who need help with school. You can help kids learn how to read, teach algebra to middle school students, or help high school students practice for their SATs.  Tutoring does not mean that you do the homework for clients or give test answers to other students. Instead, your job is to help them understand the concepts so that they can do the work themselves. Make sure you understand the line between teaching others and cheating. You can advertise your services to both students and parents.  While all business owners need to be reliable, those offering services need to be extra reliable. After all, few will notice if the kid selling candy on the subway misses a day of work, but everyone will notice if their babysitter doesn’t show up.   Keeping a calendar of your jobs and assignments is a good way of keeping on top of things so you can stay reliable. It also helps to tell your friends and family about upcoming jobs. That way, if it slips your mind, they might remember.  

watch people’s pets.  babysit people’s children.  provide neighborhood lawn care.  wash and detail people’s cars.  tutor other students.  be reliable. 

 Before you just go ahead and create a channel and start posting videos, think and act. Choose a suitable name for your channel and a unique one. Think of what videos you'll be posting.

Brooch pin or barrette and hot glue (optional); , Cut 4 pieces of ribbon that each measure 5 ½ inches long. Create a loop with each piece by folding with the ends meeting in the center. The loop will measure 2 ½ inches long while there will be a ¼ inch overlap of ribbon at the center., Hold each loop in place with a pin and create two crosses by pinning two pieces of ribbon at their center and repeat with the two remaining pieces of ribbon., Stitch the four pieces of ribbon together with matching coloured thread. The eight loops should look like eight petals once you’ve stitched the two crosses together.Your stitching should resemble a box at the center point at which the two crosses come together. The box makes sure that the loops do not come loose and your flower remains secure.  Ensure that the bead hole won’t be visible as you loop the thread through it. Begin at the center and continue outward to create a circle of beads. Stitch another circle around the first. This will use twice as many beads.You only need to penetrate the first layer of ribbon as you stitch your beads or pearl. The number of beads and pearls will vary depending on the diameter of the beads or pearls but generally you will be using about 5 - 7.  If you are using the flower as a brooch or barrette, simply use a glue gun to add a clasping barrette pin to the back of the flower, opposite the pearls or beads. 

gather your materials.  cut and fold your ribbon to create your flower.  create the flower petals using pins.  place the crosses together at a 45 degree angle.  stitch your beads or pearls to create the center of your flower.  stitch the flower onto clothes or use it as a brooch or barrette (optional).

The app to use on the iPhone is called MobileTerminal and it’s available for free in the Cydia store. , You’ll be prompted for the ‘old’ (current) password for the mobile user. Enter this as the old password: alpine  , You’ll then be prompted to enter the new password – so just type in your desired new password. Use good password principles if possible (long and strong). You will not see characters appearing on the screen as you type – that’s normal, not a concern.  You’ll then be prompted to re-enter the new password. Do that.   You should then be returned to the Mobile$ prompt that you started on when opening the MobileTerminal app. There’s no success message to say the password was changed – but if you’re returned to the prompt and do not get an error, the change was successful. And you’re done with change for the mobile account.   Enter this: alpine  ; ,,,

 Any coconut oil will work, whether it's labeled for hair or cooking. There are many types, however, so use this guide to find a quality oil:A *"virgin," "extra-virgin," or "unrefined" label means the coconut oil has no added chemicals. A high quality virgin coconut oil should be pure white when solid, and clear when liquid. A "refined" or unlabeled product has probably gone through an industrial process. There are high- and low-quality examples, but they are difficult to evaluate without researching the brand. These tend to have a more mild scent.; , Either type of oil can be extracted from the coconut in one of several ways. This is a little technical, and you can skip it without much harm done. For those interested in finding the perfect brand, here's a breakdown:   "Centrifuged" oils tend to have a more mild scent, and little risk of damage. "Expeller-pressed" or "cold-pressed" oils range from mild to strong scented. Low-quality examples may have heat damage, which cause unpleasant burnt scents. "Direct Micro Expelled" (DME) oil tends to be high-quality, and created directly by coconut farmers. This may be difficult to find.  Virgin coconut oil melts at 76ºF (24ºC), so in temperate weather it may already melt as you apply it to your hair.If you prefer handling liquid oil, spoon about 2–3 tablespoons (30–45mL) coconut oil into a bowl. Place the bowl in a larger container and pour hot tap water into the larger container, until it reaches halfway up the bowl. The oil should turn liquid within a few minutes.   Do not microwave the oil. While this probably won't make it less effective, it can make the oil dangerously hot., Knots and tangles will make applying the oil more difficult., As a pre-wash conditioner, coconut oil reduces hygral fatigue, or swollen, damaged hair caused by water exposure. It may also reduce damage caused by brushing and heat-treating wet hair.Massage a small amount of coconut oil onto the roots of your hair, and drag it down throughout all your hair. Make sure you use an old towel and no clothes as coconut oil stains clothes and towels. Leave the oil in for 10–20 minutes first to treat damaged hair as well. Keep it under a shower cap or plastic bag to prevent dripping and keep it warm. Wash and condition your hair as usual.   Although your hair will be more resistant to damage, it won't be invulnerable. When convenient, avoid brushing and heat-drying wet hair to reduce damage.  As a leave-in conditioner, coconut oil reduces damage caused by brushing or handling wet hair, and adds shine.Start with a pea-sized amount, and saturate the ends. Work your way up, adding a light layer to the middle and nothing at all to the roots.Add a little more if necessary, but not so much that your hair feels greasy. Leave this in as long as you like.   This technique will restore some strength to chemically treated hair, heat-damaged hair, and dry Afro-textured hair.If you have frizzy hair, this will tame your curls in the short term. However, since coconut oil penetrates the hair, your hair will frizz again over time. Mineral oil is more effective for this purpose, although it will not restore strength., A heavy application of coconut oil can restore strength and shine to dry, damaged hair. About once a week or whenever convenient, set aside some time for a big treatment. To start out, rub in the oil with your fingers, or dip a pastry brush into liquid oil. Massage it over all of your hair, focusing on dry or damaged areas.   If you have thick or long hair, section it first and apply the oil in sections.  After a heavy application, tie your hair up and keep it under a shower cap, plastic bag, or plastic wrap.  Optionally, use a thermal cap or a steamer for 10–30 minutes to increase absorption.You may also need a plastic cap to prevent burning and heat damage.  Coconut oil might be the best oil ever at soaking into your hair. After just one hour, your hair can absorb about 15% of its weight in oil. If you have severely damaged hair, leave the oil in for six hours to increase this to about 25%., After you're finished with the heavy application, wash your hair twice and use conditioner to remove all the oil from your scalp and hair. The absorbed coconut oil will remain inside the hair shaft, protecting it from further damage.  Rubbing in coconut oil can be highly effective at fighting certain types of scalp infections, called dermatophytes.Symptoms include a swollen scalp, abscesses on the scalp, or hair loss that leaves black dots of broken hair on the scalp.Always talk to a doctor first when dealing with a serious medical problem. Talk to a doctor first if you already apply medication to your scalp.  If you have head lice and prescription treatment (permethrin) has failed to get rid of them, a spray of coconut and anise may do the trick.As always, a conversation with your doctor is a good first step.  Although some people use coconut oil for dandruff, this is generally a bad idea. Dandruff is usually caused by fungus that feeds on your scalp's natural oils. Adding more natural oil may just increase the food supply.Try a mineral oil instead, or other treatments.  

select virgin or refined coconut oil.  check the label for extraction information.  melt the oil (optional).  brush your hair.  prevent water damage.  prevent tearing.  restore strength and shine.  tie up your hair.  add heat (optional).  leave the oil in for 1–8 hours.  wash your hair.  fight scalp infections with coconut oil.  apply coconut anise sprays to head lice.  avoid using coconut oil to treat dandruff. 

 Pick up a map of tour from a visitor’s center or your hotel. Circle the spots that you want to see, and determine the best route to get between these points. Be sure to measure how far it is between each spot, so that you are not walking too far.   For example, you may want to start at Times Square, then walk down Broadway to 34th Street to see the Empire State building. From there, you can go up Fifth Avenue to see the New York Public Library. You can turn down 49th street to end at Rockefeller Plaza.It may be easier to limit yourself to a single neighborhood or area, especially if you have never been to New York before. This will help you make the most of your time while reducing the chance you get lost.  To give yourself the same information about your landmarks as a professional tour, you can buy a guidebook. This book can tell you all of the same interesting facts, stories, and histories that you would learn on a professional tour. There are many guidebooks that are designed for self-guided walking tours. You can ask someone at your hotel for advice, or you can stop by a news kiosk or bookstore.  Another option is to download a walking app on your phone. Some apps can help you track your path via GPS. Others offer audio guides. Apps can be a cheaper option to guidebooks.   Central Park’s official app can guide you around the park with audio commentary. UrbanWonderer and iTourMobile offer free audio tours on Android and Apple devices.  The New York Times offers an app called The Scoop that offers suggestions on places to see and visit., Since you will be guiding your own tour, you will be responsible for making sure that you do not go over your allotted time. If you have a busy schedule, you should keep an eye on how long it takes you to go between places. If you are running short on time, you may have to reduce how long you spend at each landmark.  

plan your route.  buy a guidebook.  download an app.  time yourself. 

 A handwritten letter conveys sincerity from the moment it arrives. Your reader knows you mean it. You have to wait a few days, but this usually isn't bad. The payoff is worth the delay.   If you can't write a hand-written letter, for some reason, then word-process it and print it out if at all possible. E-mails aren't usually the best way to have serious, heart-felt communications, but it'll also be fine in a pinch if it's necessary. Just make sure your copyedit all e-mails and follow the rules of usage and grammar, as if you were writing for school.; , To begin, think about the person you are writing to and why you want to write them a letter. Is it an apology? A thank you? An invitation? Condolences? Whatever it is, make sure you know why you are writing to this person. If you don't know why you're writing the letter, the won't know why they are reading it.   What are your intentions for the letter? It's also very important that your biggest goal is to express yourself, not to induce a certain outcome. For example, if you are writing a love letter, your goal is to express how much you care about this person. Your goal in writing this letter isn't to start a relationship, so don't write to them as if that's your goal.  For some it is easy it just spill out what is felt on the inside. In order for your writing to have any meaning you need to focus on your truthful feelings and emotion. On a piece of scratch paper or a notepad that's sitting around consider who you are writing your letter to and the topic of the letter. No matter how heartfelt you are in your writing, if the person receiving the letter does not see the importance of what you are trying to get across they may not respond the way you would like them to. Once you have full confidence in what you want to say and you get your thoughts all sorted out start writing.  Don't beat around the bush. Start your letter by telling them why you are writing them a letter. If you already know, it's important to share the reason with your reader. Write something like: "I'm writing to you because I haven't seen you in so long. I miss you and want to catch up."   Formatting-wise, begin the letter by writing "Dear _____," at the top of the letter, adding in their name or names. This works, regardless of your intentions in writing the letter, or if you're writing for multiple reasons: "I heard about the passing of your mother, and I am so very sorry."  , If you're writing an apology, you might feel scared that they're still angry or worried that you hurt them too badly to recover a relationship. If you're writing a thank you, you might feel grateful to have friends who care about you. If you're writing an invitation, you might feel excitement at the thought of spending time together. Whatever it is that you're feeling, express that here.  If someone has passed away, you can write a funny or nice thing you remember about the deceased. If you're trying to reconnect with someone after a long time, you might want to share a story about something that's happened to you recently. A heartfelt letter does not have to be serious the whole way through, although sometimes they might be. When thinking about a story, ask yourself if this is something you truly want to share with them. If you do, it'll come across on paper. If you don't or don't feel like a story is appropriate, leave it out.  Truth is, even the sincerest, most loving people think about themselves a lot and like to hear about themselves. If you put important stuff in the middle of a ramble about your life, your news, your feelings, your reader may miss it and get the wrong message. Bad!   If your feelings are an important subject in the letter, state them succinctly. If possible draw connections to your reader's role in those feelings. Don't assume you know your reader's feelings. "I hope you feel..." is fine. So is "If you feel..." "I know you feel..." is not. Give them room to have their own feelings.  If this person is going through something difficult, you might want to let them know that you are there and want to offer your support. Be specific if you can. You can say something like "Give me a call whenever you like," or "Let me know if there's anything around the house that needs doing."   If you're writing an apology, you can offer them your regret and willingness to listen. No matter why you are writing, make sure that your offer is sincere. It should be something you truly think they might need or like, otherwise it'll come off as hollow. Think of this as a chance to extend yourself toward them. It's up to them whether they want to grab your hand and talk, meet up, join you, accept help, forgive or whatever their reaction might be. This way, they know that you aren't offering empty words, and they might feel more comfortable reaching out.  The most important thing when you're writing any letter is to use not fancy words, complicated words, or long words, but to use the right words. Writing your heart out means that you need to use correct words to express what you're feeling. Use vivid details to make your intentions clear.   It's good to use good words, but don't get addicted to the thesaurus. Sometimes, saying that you were out for a "stroll" might be the most appropriate word, but most of the time calling it a "walk" will be a lot  , Letters are best when they're clear, concise, and heartfelt. Depending on the purpose of the writing and the reader, it's usually best to keep most letters to no more than a few pages. Short also encourages a call or meeting, which is good for anything important.   There's no right length for a letter. Go as long as the letter takes to express everything that you need to express.  To close, think of an appropriate salutation. Sincerely is always good, as is "Yours sincerely." If you are close, you can use "Love." Other choices might be "Your friend," "With gratitude," "Thinking of you," or "Thank you." This is one more opportunity to express your feelings to them. Then sign your name, and you have finished your heartfelt letter.  You may go back and read your letter before sending. You can correct, add or take out, but only do so for the sake of clarity and hand-writing.   If you're written anything defensive or aggressive, take it out. Even if you are expressing anger, there shouldn't be any aggression in the letter.  

put it on paper.  consider your audience.  do a little pre-writing.  open the letter clearly.  share your feelings with your reader.  have some moments of lightness as well.  talk about them.  offer your support, if necessary.  use strong words specific details.  keep it short.  end the letter appropriately.  recopy the letter if necessary. 

 It might seem odd to eat before a workout to feel energized after, but it can work. You know your body best, but some people who eat before a morning workout discover they have more energy during and after the workout.A small shake with some whey protein or a piece of fruit is a great option for a small, pre-workout meal.  On the nights before you plan to work out in the morning, go to bed earlier than usual. How early you go to bed should correspond to how early you're waking up for your workout. If you stick to this schedule for the days you want to work out in the morning, your body will get used to it and it can become easier.For example, if you normally go to bed at 10 pm and wake up at 7 am but want to fit in a 30-minute work out in the morning, go to bed at 9:30 pm and wake up at 6:30 am instead.  Your body needs to be warmed up properly before you begin any intense workout. Because your body's temperature is lowest right when you wake up first thing in the morning, you need to make sure you perform a longer warm up than you would if you were working out in the afternoon. You should warm up for about 10 minutes before a morning workout.You can warm up by stretching, walking, and doing jumping jacks without injuring your body.  

eat before your workout.  get enough rest the night before.  warm up for longer than usual. 

 With any kind of forearm tendinitis, it is more common for your dominant hand to be affected, but both arms may be affected. Tendinitis will occur in the tendons against which you consistently exert the most force.Tendinitis may also occur in the tendons that control either extension or flexion (straightening or bending), but it rarely occurs in both at the same time. The repetitive motion that exerts the most stress — either force against flexion or against extension — will cause tendinitis.  Tennis elbow may develop if you exert force against an object with your elbow extended.Although tennis elbow is often caused by playing tennis, using a lighter racquet and a two-handed backhand swing may reduce your chances of developing this condition. Some other types of movement that may also cause tennis elbow include:   Repetitive heavy lifting or using heavy tools Jobs that involve the use of squeezing and twisting movements or precision motions New or uncommon movements, such as gardening for the first time in the spring, lifting a new baby, or packing and moving your home  , Although named after the sport of golf, golfer’s elbow can also be caused by other sports that involve gripping and/or throwing motions, such as baseball, football, archery, or javelin throwing.Some other types of movement that may cause golfer’s elbow include:   Doing jobs that involve repetitive motion of the elbow, including computer use, gardening, chopping or painting Using vibrating tools Using a racquet that is too small or heavy for your ability or putting excessive topspin on the ballParticipating in other repetitive activities for an hour or more on consecutive days, such as weight lifting, cooking, hammering, raking, or chopping wood 

think about whether you are having symptoms in one or both arms.  identify repetitive movements that may have contributed to your tennis elbow.  consider activities that may have contributed to your golfer’s elbow. 

 Your cat will always want to scratch on things, and if it doesn’t know how to use a scratching post, it will use your furniture instead. Before bringing your cat inside, place a scratching post in a dry spot, near your cat’s food. Give your cat at least a week to become accustomed to using a scratching post before bringing it inside., Before bringing your cat indoors, place a little box outside in a dry location. Fill the litter box with fine-grain, clumping litter. Give your cat approximately a week to get accustomed to the litter box before bringing it inside.Make sure to clean the litter box every day. Outdoor cats tend to like to use clean areas to eliminate waste. If the litter box is not clean, they are likely not to use it. Put the litter box in a safe and quiet area. Otherwise, the cat might be too scared or hesitant to use it.  Before bringing your cat indoors, you should be sure that it won’t be bringing disease with it. If your cat hasn’t already been microchipped, a process that allows it to be identified, your veterinarian should perform this procedure as well. A wild cat will also need to be vaccinated and neutered.Before the cat is spayed or neutered, the vet should perform a test for Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV). FeLV is highly infectious between cats and can be deadly if untreated. The vet will do two blood tests to see if your cat has this disease.The vet should do a complete check-up of the cat. This includes checking for ear mites, fleas, lice, and other parasites. The cat should also be dewormed.  Your cat isn’t likely to adapt immediately to living indoors. To prevent it from doing damage to your house, you should let it outside periodically, until it seems to be comfortable inside.Begin by allowing your cat indoors for brief periods of time. Then keep it inside for progressively longer each time.  While you might still allow your cat outside periodically, you should only give it food and water inside. This way, it will come to associate food with being inside. This will create positive associations with your home., Place one litter box in a place that is convenient for you. Place the other near the door your cat takes to exit the house. This way, when your cat wants to go outdoors to use the restroom, it will see the litter box and use it instead. As your cat gets accustomed to the litter box, move the one near the door closer to the interior litter box. When the two litter boxes are next to each other, you can remove one.   Use litter boxes that are large, but not very high. To encourage your cat to use the litter box, you should remove all obstacles. Thus, you should avoid boxes with tops or boxes that require your cat to jump up high to get inside of. The cat should feel secure when using the litter box. Place the litter box in a quiet area of the house where other animals and humans won't bother it too much.  Don’t allow your cat to decide for itself when it leaves your home. If you have a screened-in porch, you can allow your cat onto it periodically. You can also purchase a harness designed for cats and take your cat outside on walk. Some cats are resistant to walking on a leash but if you can leash train your cat you will both find it to be a rewarding experience. , Your cat will feel less of a need to break out to hunt, if it has plenty of opportunities to express its hunter’s instincts inside. You should have several balls, fake mice, and other toys for your cat to play with. Most importantly, you should play with your cat to give it something exciting to do in your home.If you roll a ball along the floor, your cat might chase it and swat at it. Try getting a toy mouse attached to a stick. Drag the mouse on the floor or dangle it over your cat’s head. Your cat should try to attack it. Cats also like feather toys. These are often feathers that are attached to the end of a string or a stick. Drag them on the ground or dangle them in the air. Try rotating new toys into the home every couple of weeks to keep your cat interested.  Many cats enjoy the smell of this herb. Buy some and place it in strategic spots where your cat likes to spend time or where you would like it to spend time. Placing it on a scratching post, for example, can encourage it to begin sharpening its nails on the post, instead of your furniture., Cats enjoy looking down on humans and jumping to high lookout spots. At the pet store, you can buy “cat trees” with multiple platforms for your cat to jump on and climb around.Cat trees can be expensive. Alternatively, you can clear off some shelves or arrange your desks and bookshelves so that your cat has nice perches to jump to.  A warm, comfy cat bed can be a great way to entice a cat indoors during cold and rainy months. If you don’t want to buy a special cat bed, try to arrange some blankets on your bed or couch in an inviting way. If your cat finds a spot that it seems to like, set the space aside for it., Cats love to sit in the sun and providing an indoor sunning spot will decrease the incentive for your cat to run outside. If you don’t have a windowsill that is an appropriate sunning spot, place a table next to the window for your cat to lay on. Leave your blinds up near the bed, so your cat can catch some sun on a warm bed.   If you open the window, be sure that the screen is secure so that your cat can’t bust out., Pet stores and even some grocery stores sell cat grass that can grow inside. The grass is a nice snack for your cat and will remind it of being outside., If your cat is scratching or refusing to use the litter box, put it in a small room with all its toys, scratching posts, and litter boxes. There will be less furniture for your cat to damage here and your cat is more likely to learn to use the litter box if it is confined to a small space with it., SoftPaws are pieces of plastic that can be glued onto a cat’s claws to prevent it from scratching. To place the soft paws on the cat, one person will need to hold the cat. Another person will clip the cat’s nails and then glue the SoftPaws on.   Squeeze the cat’s paws gently to encourage it to show its claws. Then use a clipper to trim the claws. If you do not have experience trimming a cat’s claws, cut only the end, to avoid cutting too deep and hurting it. Squeeze the glue that comes with the SoftPaws into the SoftPaws. Then place the SoftPaws on your cat’s claws and push until the plastic covers the entire claw. Cats can have their claws permanently removed, but declawing is generally considered inhumane and should be avoided if possible.  Even if your cat still periodically leaves your home, you should be in control of it when it leaves. Watch the door closely to ensure that it does not sneak out. If it does, do not hit it, because that will make it less likely to want to stay inside. Use moderate reinforcement to encourage it to behave better.   If your cat tries to make a run to the door squirt it with a water bottle or rattle a jar of coins. Throw a treat or a toy in the opposite direction when you open the door. This will encourage your cat to run away from the open door and break it of the habit of running away. 

train your cat to use the scratching post outside.  train your cat to use a litter box outside.  take your cat to a veterinarian.  take it slow.  feed your cat indoors.  give your cat two litter boxes.  allow controlled outside time.  buy toys for your home.  buy catnip.  get a cat tree.  give your cat a warm place to sleep.  give your cat a sunny spot to rest.  grow some cat grass.  designate one room for the cat.  buy softpaws.  discourage your cat from running outside. 

 Even if you're strong and in great shape, most scrap hauling is at least a two person job. Figure out a fair salary for an employee or share in the profits with a partner.   If your business focuses only on more manageable items, such as wires and electronics, you can start out on your own.  Major sources include businesses that use and discard metal and homeowners throwing away bulky items like refrigerators and air conditioners. You may even choose to buy used cars at scrap prices.   The business transaction that comes from obtaining your scrap will vary. Many commercial sources will require payment from you. However, if you advertise as a junk-disposal business to consumers, you can often obtain scrap for free or even charge for your service.  Take out ads in your local newspaper, post your business on online forums, and flyer door to door. Let your neighbors know that you are starting a scrap metal business and ask them to send any discarded metal your way., A larger local scrap yard or recycling center are some options. You can also advertise scrap metal that you have for sale. If you decide to start a scrap yard, it can be open to the public at certain times for customers to browse and buy., Optimize the efficiency of your business by organizing your time. Set aside different day(s) to obtain scrap, sort and dismantle metal, and delivering it to buyers. Keep at it to make sure your operation runs smoothly. If you neglect any of these three tasks, the work can build up and make doing the other two impossible.  

hire an employee or find a business partner.  start making arrangements to collect scrap.  advertise your new business.  find buyers for your scrap metal.  work out a schedule. 

 Wrap the yarn over the crochet hook three times, working from back to front around the hook.Wrap the yarn in between the loop already on your hook and the opening of the hook. Note that each consecutive yarn-over should be made in between the last one and the opening, not in between the previous yarn-over and the starting loop on your hook.; , Slide the tip of the hook into the stitch indicated in your pattern instructions.   Only insert the tip of the hook. Do not draw any of the yarn already on your hook through the stitch. Keep the working yarn behind your crochet piece as you continue along.  With the opening of the crochet hook still behind the piece, wrap the yarn over the hook once, letting this yarn-over slide into the opening of the hook.   Wrap the yarn from back to front.  Pull the crochet hook back through to the front of the stitch, bringing the most recent yarn-over with it. Note that the yarn-over has now turned into a loop.   There should be five loops on your hook at this point. You may need to keep tension on the previously worked portion of the piece using the thumb and index finger of your non-dominant hand (the hand not holding onto the hook). Doing so can make it easier to slide the hook in and out of the stitch.  Wrap the yarn over the tip of the hook once more time.   Work from back to front again. Let the yarn-over slip into the opening of the hook.  With the previous yarn-over caught in the hook opening, draw it through the top two loops previously on your hook.   If you have difficulty drawing the yarn-over through the loops, gently twist the hook so that the opening faces down and try again. You should be left with four loops on your hook at this point.  Yarn over the hook, then draw the yarn-over through two loops. Repeat this three more times until you are left with only one loop on your hook.After the first repetition, you will have three loops left on the hook. After the second repetition, you will have two loops remaining on the hook. After the third repetition, you will only be left with one loop on the hook. Once you complete this step, you have completed one DTR (double treble crochet) stitch.  Attach the yarn to your crochet hook using a slipknot and create a foundation chain. Your foundation chain needs to have five stitches more than the number of double treble crochets you want in your first row.   For example, if you want to create a row of 10 double treble crochets, you need to start with a foundation chain made of 15 chain stitches. If you do not know how to make a chain stitch or a slipknot, please check the "Tips" section for additional help.  Skip over the first five stitches next to your hook and work one standard double treble crochet into the sixth stitch. Use the same method described in the "Double Treble Crochet Stitch" section of the article.   Yarn over three times. Insert the hook into the stitch to be worked. In this case, it is the sixth stitch. Yarn over once. Draw the yarn-over back through to the front of the stitch to create a loop. Yarn over once. Draw the yarn-over through two loops. Repeat three more times: yarn over, draw it through two loops; yarn over, draw it through two loops; yarn over, draw it through two loops. This completes the stitch.  Work one double treble crochet into each chain of your foundation chain. Continue doing this until you reach the end of the chain.   To complete a straight row, only make one double treble crochet per stitch. Once you reach the end of the chain, you have completed a first full row of double treble crochet.  If you have not done so already, flip the crochet work over so that its front becomes the back and its back becomes the front.   Note that this technique applies if you are working on your second row or any row after that. It will vary slightly from a row of double treble crochet completed from a foundation chain.    The purpose of a turning chain is to extend the yarn up to the finished height of your next row, and the height of that turning chain is based on the type of stitch you will be making in that row. For a row of double treble crochet, you need a chain of five stitches. When counting the stitches in this row, you will count your turning chain as one double treble crochet.  Work one standard double treble crochet stitch into the second stitch of the previous row, counting the stitches starting at your hook. When the time comes, insert the hook into both top loops of the stitch, working from front to back. The double treble crochet you make now should follow the basic instructions provided in this article.   Yarn over three times. Insert the yarn into the stitch to be worked. In this case, that should be the second stitch. Make sure that you insert the hook into both top loops from front to back. Yarn over once. Draw the yarn-over into a loop at the front of the piece. Yarn over once. Draw the yarn-over through two loops on your hook. Repeat three more times: yarn over, draw it through two loops; yarn over, draw it through two loops; yarn over, draw it through two loops. When you only have one loop on your hook, the stitch is complete.  Make one and only one double treble crochet in each stitch of the previous row. Continue until you reach the end of the row to complete a full row of double treble crochet.   Note that for future rows, you will need to make your last double treble crochet into the fifth stitch of the turning chain from the previous row. You can complete as many rows of double treble crochet as desired using this technique.  

yarn over the hook three times.  insert the hook into the indicated stitch.  yarn over the hook once.  draw a loop back to the front of the stitch.  yarn over once.  bring it through two loops.  repeat three more times.  make a foundation chain.  work one dtr into the sixth chain.  repeat the stitch across the row.  turn the work.  chain five.work a short turning chain of five chain stitches.  work one dtr into the second stitch.  repeat across the row. 

 Turn your garden hose on full spray and wash any dirt and grime off the brick as best you can with the strong force of the hose spray. Work methodically from one side to the other so that it doesn’t keep spraying back onto a part you have already cleaned.  You may also use a bucket with soapy water to scrub stains off of exterior red brick.You can use different hose settings to access some of the harder to reach places. For example, you might need a more steady stream to get rid of cobwebs hiding in corners and crevices.  Make a cleaning solution using four parts water to one part bleach. Combine it all in a bucket. Scrape off any moss or mold with a spatula or a stiff-bristled brush. Apply a generous covering of the bleach mixture directly to the red brick and let it sit overnight. Then you can rinse off the bleach mixture with a hose.If there are still traces of mold remaining, you can make a stronger mixture – half water and half bleach – and let it sit on the red brick for two days before rinsing it off.  Once you have finished cleaning your exterior red bricks, consider sealing them with a siloxane- or silane-based sealer. This will help protect your bricks from future stains, and it will prevent dirt and grime from building up on your bricks over time.You should be able to purchase these products at any home improvement store.  

use a hose to wash off dirt and debris.  apply a bleach mixture to eliminate moss and mold.  seal the bricks for future protection. 

 These determine where the head, chest, and hips are going to be.; , Add the banana-shaped tail. Make sure your lines are smooth and even.  Draw the legs of the dog. They are squiggly, teardrop-like shapes that connect to the main body--they look too frail to support such a sturdy dog, but once you've shaped your hound a little more they'll be more in proportion.  These should be a little thicker at the top, and the back leg should be positioned in such a way that it looks like your dog is leaning forward.  They are shaped like rounded triangles over the ends of the legs, almost like horses' hooves.  For the other ear and the nose, draw two more rounded triangles.  To make your dog look realistic you can use grey, brown, white, or black, but be sure to use different tones throughout. And don't forget to add toes to his feet!  

start by drawing circles of various sizes in the same proximity to one another as shown here.  connect the circles with curved lines.  erase the excess guidelines.  draw another set of legs in front of the first set.  draw the paws.  draw another rounded triangle for the snout, a few curves for one of the ears, and one for the back of the snout.  color in your drawing. 

 Make sure your home printer can print on cardstock. Load a sheet of cardstock (or blank postcards) into your printer's paper tray. Print out however many copies of your postcard that you want.   If you are printing both the front and back of your postcards, print a page of "fronts" first. Then, load the cardstock back into your printer's paper tray before printing the "backs." If you're unsure which side your printer prints to, try doing this using a test page on normal printer paper first.  Unless your postcard takes up the entire sheet of paper, you will need to cut your printout into separate cards. If you have a paper cutter, use that to quickly make consistent cuts into multiple copies at once. Otherwise, hand cut them one at a time with a pair of scissors. Some blank postcards are perforated so that all you will need to do is tear where necessary.  If your Word document didn't include addresses, write them in. You can also add a handwritten message to any available blank space. Affix a stamp to the top right corner of the addressed side, and your card is ready to post.  

print out your cards.  cut out each card.  ready your cards for mailing. 

 Easy fruit punch is made by mixing juices and sodas with pre-mixed tropical punch. It's a step up from simply serving plain bottled tropical punch at a party. By adding fresh ingredients, you can transform bottled punch into something fit for any occasion.Be sure to mix the ingredients until the sugar is completely dissolved. You can skip the sugar if you don't want your punch to be too sweet. Add 1/2 cup of lime or lemon juice to give your punch a fresh boost.  Right before serving, pour in the ginger ale to add flavor and carbonation to your punch. Make sure you add it just before serving, or the punch might go flat before the party starts.   You can substitute the ginger ale for lemon-lime soda. Or try adding plain club soda if you think your punch is already sweet enough.  Pour it from the bowl into a glass serving bowl or tureen. Serve the punch in small cups with ice. Here are a few optional serving suggestions:   Make an extra batch of punch and freeze it using regular ice cube trays, then add the punch ice cubes to the punch when you're ready to serve it. If the punch is for a themed party, try making an ice ring (freeze punch or water in a bundt cake pan) or an ice hand for halloween (freeze punch or water in a latex glove tied at the end). Add several scoops of lemon, orange, raspberry or strawberry sherbet directly to the punch bowl, or serve each cup of punch with a tiny scoop. If the punch is being served at an adult party, add 2 cups of white rum or vodka to make it alcoholic.  

mix the tropical punch, pineapple juice and sugar in a large bowl.  add the soda.  serve the punch.

 Even if you’ve grown up in a more casual environment where you usually call your friends’ parents by their first names, you shouldn’t assume that all older people are comfortable with that kind of informal title. Some elderly people may be more traditional, and prefer that you call them Mr./Mrs. So-and-So. That’s why it’s always best to ask what name they prefer and use sir or ma'am when you don't feel comfortable asking., People can often lose strength, balance, and agility as they age, which can make some everyday activities that we take for granted more difficult. Providing even the smallest assistance may help make their day a little easier, and demonstrate your respect in a courteous, thoughtful manner.It’s always polite to hold the door open for the people behind you, but it can be especially helpful for older people with canes or walkers. When you’re on public transportation, such as the subway, train, or bus, consider offering your seat to an elderly person, who might need to rest more than you. If you’re at the store, offer to reach for items on shelves that might be too high or low for an older person to reach. You might also offer to carry an elderly person’s bags to the car or unload their cart into the trunk.  Older people usually don’t move as quickly as they used to when they were younger, which means it can take them longer to do even the simplest of tasks, such as crossing the street. Be respectful by showing some patience when you encounter them instead of trying to hurry them along.If an elderly person is slow to get off the bus, subway, or elevator, or just walking down the street, don’t push past them. Let them take their time, so they are comfortable and don’t injure themselves. Don’t huff and puff if an older person on line in front of you at a store takes a little longer to pay for their items. Instead, try to be understanding -- you might even offer to help by lifting items out of the cart or bagging groceries.  While it’s true that many elderly people have health issues that may require special assistance, aging doesn’t affect all people in the same way. Assuming that an older person has poor eyesight or hearing can be extremely condescending and make him or her feel self-conscious. That’s especially true if you make a big deal out of it, such as raising your voice every time you speak to him or her.If you’re unsure whether an older person has a vision or hearing issue, just ask. It’s better to be straightforward than to risk offending someone.  

call people sir or ma'am.  offer your help.  be patient.  don’t assume they have disabilities. 

 Take your dog for a long walk or let it run around at a dog park before being around elderly people. You can also play fetch or another game where the dog runs around a lot to tire it out. Most of the danger of having an active dog around elderly people is that the dog might knock them down or injure them just out of excitement. In order to curb this risk, you should make sure to really tire the dog out before the meeting.If the dog is tired out, it is less likely to be really wild and uncontrollable. However, there are some dogs that will be really active when meeting new people or old friends no matter how much exercise you give them. Make this judgement for yourself based on your particular dog.; , In order to keep an elderly person really safe around an active dog, you need to control that dog's behavior. Extensive training that the dog consistently responds to is the best way to control its behavior. Training requires daily practice with your dog, clear and consistent directions, and positive reinforcement to encourage your dog to follow your commands.   With a well-trained dog, you can allow the dog to be around an elderly person unrestrained because you know that it will stop dangerous behavior immediately if commanded. Training that is very successful will allow you to control your dog's behavior no matter what it is doing with a simple command. This type of training takes a long time to complete. Don't expect to get total control over your dog's actions in a week or two. It takes lots and lots of repetition and positive reinforcement to instill in your dog.  If you are planning on introducing your dog to a family member then you can let the dog smell his or her smells ahead of time. Getting a piece of clothing or a sheet or blanket that the person uses and letting your dog smell it ahead of time will let the dog get the excitement of new smells over with.   If the dog has already smelled someone, then doing this before he or she comes over will not generally diffuse the dog's excitement. This tactic is usually just helpful for first time encounters. This technique is used often when introducing dogs to new babies, but can work with other types of situations as well. 

tire the dog out.  do extensive training.  allow the dog to smell the person ahead of time. 

 A plumbing snake (also sometimes called a "flexible cleaning tool" or "auger") is a flexible coil of wire that can "snake" through the curves of a drain and get deeper than a wire can. The best snake is a "closet auger" which is designed specifically to clear toilet clogs without damaging or staining the bowl. A plumber would likely use a closet auger., Push down, feeding the snake further into the drain until you feel an obstruction.  The goal is to break up the obstruction into smaller pieces that can move through the pipes. It may take a few minutes of maneuvering to clear the obstruction. Once the water drains, flush to toilet to see whether it drains as quickly as normal.  It may become necessary to remove the toilet and run the snake through in the opposite direction. This is especially true with hard obstructions that may have been flushed by a curious child. If a hard obstruction is known, and you are not comfortable removing and replacing the toilet, contact a plumber.  

purchase or borrow a plumbing snake.  insert one end of the snake into the drain.  twist and push the snake through the obstruction.  snake in reverse. 

 Everybody has a skill or interest that they excel in and genuinely enjoy. If you don't think you have a talent, you probably just haven't found it yet. It’s often necessary to be persistent and try many things before you find one that suits you.   Similar types of people may also be attracted to the same activities. For example, adrenaline junkies may not be drawn to the quiet, slow pace of a knitting club, but someone who enjoys other quiet activities might be. Determining who you enjoy being around may help you figure out what you’ll enjoy. Be patient. Change does not come all at once. It requires practice and time. It can be difficult to break out of old routines and meet new people or try new activities, especially if you’re busy (and who isn’t?). Persistence is the key. Enroll in a class you're interested in, or pick up a new instrument or sport. Not only will you learn something new, you’ll meet others who are interested in learning too. Trying to learn something new can also be a safe and productive way to push yourself out of your comfort zone.  No matter how much money you make, you will not be happy if you spend your entire life doing something you hate. While not all of us are lucky enough to make a career out of our favorite hobby, it's important to at least devote some of your time to things that make you happy.   Doing things that are meaningful to you will help you feel more happy and fulfilled. Creative pursuits, such as art or music, can help you express your feelings and thoughts in productive, healthy ways.It’s a common myth that the people who succeed most in life are the most single-minded. They don’t let anything get in the way of their one goal, including taking time for themselves. Unfortunately, that can be a very unhealthy way of living. Try not to allow yourself to focus so much on one aspect of your life that you forget to nurture the other ones.If you’re chronically unhappy at your job, consider why. It’s possible that some changes could change how you feel about it. If the reason you’re unhappy is because you feel like your job isn’t meaningful, or isn’t in line with your values, consider finding another line of work., Life must be a balance between work and play. Focusing exclusively on one or the other will eventually lead to stagnation and monotonous daily routines. Humans adapt very quickly to positive events. Because of that, we can become desensitized to positive experiences, especially if that’s our only experience.Research has shown that when we’re squarely in our comfort zone, we aren’t as productive as we are when we step just beyond it.It’s important to seek out new experiences and interactions with others, even when those are a little scary. Doing so can help you achieve more. Our desire to avoid discomfort and hurt can lead us to refuse flexibility. However, research shows that embracing vulnerability -- including the possibility that something will go wrong -- is crucial to experiencing all of life.Mindfulness meditation can be a good place to start. One of the goals of mindfulness is to become more aware of any repetitive thought patterns that may be getting in the way of self-awareness and self-acceptance. Find a class or do some research to find out what techniques work best for you.

 But don't turn it just yet - if you do, nothing will happen! There are several more steps you need to take before you can safely start the car.       ; , In a manual transmission car there are three pedals - the clutch, the brake and the accelerator/gas. It is essential that you have a firm grasp of which pedal is which before you begin driving.          The pedal on the far left is the clutch. It allows you to disengage the engine from the wheels while you are changing gears. It should be operated using your left foot. The middle pedal is the brake and the pedal on the far right is the accelerator. Both of these pedals are operated using the right foot. Remember that the order of these pedals does not change regardless of whether you are in a left hand drive or right hand drive vehicle.  Before you can start the car, you will need to ensure that the car is in neutral. The car is in neutral when:           The gear shift is in the neutral position. You can tell it's in the neutral position if it feels loose to the touch and you can move it easily from side to side. If the gear shift is not in neutral, you can fix this by pressing down fully on the clutch and moving the shift into the central (neutral) position.  The clutch is fully depressed. If you prefer, you can also put the car in neutral by pressing down fully on the clutch with your left foot.  Once the car is in neutral, you are ready to turn the key in the ignition and start the car. Just remember:          If you put the car into neutral by moving the gear shift into the neutral position, you can turn the key in the ignition without having to depress the clutch pedal. However, if you put the car into neutral by simply pressing down on the clutch (while the shift is still in gear), you will need to hold the clutch down as you turn the key. Otherwise the car could lunge forward.  Once the car is running, you will need to put the car into gear before you can start moving. (Unless your car is already in gear, in which case you can just skip to step 3). To put your car in gear, press down fully on the clutch.  Keeping your foot pressed down on the clutch, move the gear shift into first gear. This is usually done by moving the gear shift to the left and then up - the number 1 should be clearly marked on the top left corner of the stick.  Very slowly, begin inching your foot off the clutch pedal. Keep lifting your foot until the engine speed (or RPM) begins to drop and the car begins to move slowly forward. This is known as the "biting point".  Once you find the biting point, it's time to start pressing down on the accelerator, slowly and gently.          As your right foot begins to press down on the accelerator, your left foot should continue to release the clutch, in a simultaneous motion. If you complete this action correctly, the car will start to move forward and you will be driving in first gear.  Be careful - if you release the clutch too quickly, the car will stall (stop running) and you will have to start the process again.          On the other hand, if you press down too hard on the accelerator before the clutch is fully released you may wear out the clutch, causing damage to your vehicle. Don't worry though - you are bound to stall at least a couple of times when you're learning to drive a manual transmission car. Finding the perfect balance between releasing the clutch and depressing the accelerator takes practice.  When your engine begins to race and sounds like it's under pressure (usually around 2500 to 3000 RPM - though this varies depending on the car), you will need to move up into second gear. To do this:          Take your right foot off the accelerator (if necessary) and use your left foot to fully depress the clutch. Grab the gear shift and move it straight downwards into second gear - which should be clearly marked by the number 2 on the stick.  You will need to follow a slightly different procedure for starting your manual transmission car if you are parked on a hill. This is necessary to prevent the car from rolling backwards.  To perform a hill start using the brake pedal, begin with your left foot depressing the clutch and your right foot depressing the brake. Put the car into gear, release the hand brake, then lift your foot off the clutch until you find the biting point. Now release the brake (keeping the clutch at the biting point will prevent the car from rolling backwards) and press down on the accelerator, using slightly more gas than usual. Continue as normal.  To perform a hill start using the hand brake, put your foot on the clutch and put the car into gear. Slowly release the clutch until you find the biting point, then release the hand brake. Once you have released the hand brake, put your foot on the accelerator and proceed as normal.         

insert the key into the ignition.  identify the clutch, the brake and the accelerator.  make sure the car is in neutral.  start the ignition.  press down fully on the clutch.  move the gear shift into first gear.  slowly lift your foot off the clutch.  begin pressing down on the accelerator.  beware of stalling.  move into second gear.  understand the hill start.  use the brake pedal.  use the hand brake. 

 This experiment allows you to grow a crystal out of solution by submerging it in a saturated solution. To grow crystals using submersion, you will need: distilled water, washing soda (sodium carbonate), a glass jar, string, a pencil, a pot for boiling, and a spoon.Distilled water has fewer impurities in it and is better for crystal formation. Call the store to ask if they have washing soda. Some large chains do not carry it, but neighborhood stores often do. It was a common washing detergent in the early 20th century and it is gaining a following for being environmentally-friendly now.The pencil needs to be long enough to lay across the top of the jar.  Add enough distilled water to fill your glass jar about ¾ full to a pot and bring it to a boil. Add a tablespoon of sodium carbonate to the water and stir until it dissolves. Continue adding sodium carbonate, a tablespoon at a time, until no more sodium carbonate dissolves. Stir continuously as you add.Once you start to see the sodium carbonate sink to the bottom of the pot and not dissolve, you have made a saturated solution. Adult supervision is recommended while working with the stove and boiling water. If you want to make more crystals, make more solution to add to multiple jars.  Once the solution has cooled down, pour it into your jar filling it about ¾ of the way full. Be sure to let the solution cool to room temperature before adding it to the jar.   If you’re growing multiple crystals, fill multiple jars ¾ full.  The string will serve as the nucleation site of the crystal. The nucleation site is where the crystal begins to form.Leave a tail of string long enough to hang just above the bottom of the jar. Place the pencil across the top of the jar and drop the string into the saturated washing soda solution.   You can also use pipe cleaners instead of string for this step. Form them into a shape such as a star or a heart and the crystals will grow around the shape of the pipe cleaners., Cover the jar with plastic wrap and place it somewhere no one will touch it. A windowsill is a good place because it is unlikely to be bumped like a table might be. After a few hours, you should see crystals beginning to form on the string.The longer you let the solution sit, the larger the crystals will grow.  When you are satisfied with the growth of your crystals, lift the pencil to remove the crystal/string from the jar. Now that you have made your very own crystals, you can grow them whenever you want.   Add food coloring to the water to change the color of your crystals. 

gather the necessary materials.  make a saturated sodium carbonate solution.  add the saturated solution to the glass jar.  tie the string around the pencil.  let sit undisturbed for at least five hours.  remove the string from the solution. 

 Ornate Horned Frogs are native to tropical and mountain rain forests, so they need an aquatic/terrestrial habitat. Glass aquariums are easy to clean and you can watch your frogs through the glass.These frogs aren't jumpers, so you don't strictly need a screened lid on top. However, a lid is still a good idea because it helps keep the tank warm.  Your frog feeds by “ambushing” its food, meaning it will hide in the deep substrate until prey comes near, then jump out and attack. Be sure the substrate is slightly moist at all times, never soggy or completely dry.Good substrate materials include coconut husk fiber (Bed-a-beast, Eco-earth, Forest Bed, or similar products.) Soil is a good option because it stays moist and allows your frog to dig. It looks natural, as well. Be sure to purchase safe soil that does not contain pesticides, vermiculite, perlite, or any other harmful chemicals. Cypress mulch, sphagnum moss, and leaf litter are not generally recommended, because your frog can choke on a piece of bark or moss. If you use these items, you'll need to feed using tweezers or tongs. Never use sand, gravel, or fir bark as substrate.  Add a large, shallow bowl to the tank, which should be filled with water at all times. Always use de-chlorinated water – tap water will harm your frog.Glazed ceramic trays that come with flowerpots make excellent water dishes. Most frogs defecate into their water dish, so be sure to replace the water at least daily. Place little stacks of rocks next to the bowl and in the water, so your young frog can climb in and out.  Horned Frogs don't need foliage to hide, because they burrow into the deep substrate on the bottom of the tank. But you can add artificial or real plants, if you want to make the tank look nice.Real plants can be difficult to grow indoors, and will need to be thoroughly washed and disinfected before you add them to the terrarium. Artificial plants are easier to keep clean, and you can buy a wide variety of these online or at a pet store. Air plants are living plants that do not require soil or water, apart from an occasional misting. Keep them away from harsh sunlight and heat lamps, or they will dry out., Position a low-intensity (15 watts) heat lamp over the terrarium, above the highest point in your frog's habitat. Be sure there is a screen lid to the tank between your frog and the heating bulb.Don't use under-tank heaters or heated rocks in your Ornate Horned Frog tank.  Horned frogs will thrive in a fairly large range of temperatures, and do not require careful humidity adjustments like most amphibians. Their tank should be between 75°F (24°C) and 84°F (29°C) during the day, and a few degrees cooler at night.Hang store-bought temperature strips on the side of the tank to measure environmental conditions.  

buy a 10-gallon glass aquarium.  provide a deep substrate for your frog to burrow in.  provide a water bowl.  add foliage for decoration.  add a heat source.  moderate tank temperature. 

 Make polite comments about the person to anyone you encounter, especially the departee. There is no need to be grouchy or to leap about whooping about how wonderful it is the person is leaving.  Explain that you have another pressing engagement or an appointment to anyone who asks.  Be sure enough work attendees or family members have noted your attendance so that they'll recall you were there at least, then make a hasty retreat for the back door and leave quietly.  

attend the event.  keep looking at your watch regularly.  leave after a half hour or so. 

 Practice is very important in order to improve your batting. Make sure to practice regularly, even if it is for a short interval, even half an hour. The more you practice, better your play will be.   An unplanned practice session helps in nothing but tiredness. Keep everything preplanned to help you out while practice session. You can get a coach to help you on improving your batting skills. But remember, no one can teach you anything before you put your own efforts in your game. ; , You should know your weaknesses and strengths and try to bat as much as possible to turn them into a strength. It is always better to have no weak points instead of having a few strengths. Work on balls which you feel hard to face or part of the ground where you mostly get out., It is vital to believe that you can bat well. For this, you need to be passionate about cricket. Confidence comes with practice. The more you practice, better you will know about your game. Keep yourself motivated during games. Congratulate yourself on every single run.  Don't stick to a particular shot. Different balls need to be angled differently. You can practice a shot to master it, but should not make the same response on every ball. If you play a particular shot on a couple of balls, the bowler may realize that it is your strong zone and would avoid you bowling there.  Try to set your goals such as 'Scoring 25 runs; playing yorkers'. Through this, you will increase your potential and more accurately come to know your capability. Start from small targets and then increase your levels step by step.    Play unofficial games. Play some pick-up games among friends that involve batting, but not necessarily in a true game. This would help you to increase your enthusiasm for batting and improve your skills at the same time. You will come to know about handling pressure and play under tense circumstances.  Know your role. Find out what team wants from you and what position do you play in. Sometimes your team expects very much from you, but you do not know what you have to do when you go in.  Interact with your teammates. Attend team meetings and discuss strategies. An effective communication will help your teammates play well as a unit.  Guess what could be the next ball from the bowler. If you know the tricks and the bowling speed of the bowler, you can decide your shots and adjust your timing.   Nothing can be done once the ball is delivered. You have to guess right from the run-up. Place yourself in the bowler's position. Guess what you would have done if you were at the other end. This will help you guess and respond accordingly.  Learn different tricks like playing the hook shots and playing drives. Always try to play from the middle of the bat, called the sweet spot.  Try to watch more and more matches and observe the strategies, then apply them in your own game.   Follow one of your favorite cricketers. Notice their style of playing and adapt those styles in your own game.  If you can't achieve your goal, don't lose confidence. Every player has variations in capabilities and talent; some players don't achieve their goal even after many tries. The key is to not give up and keep practicing.  Most importantly, you should love and enjoy the game. Play with a cool mind ;accept defeats and take them as a challenge and move on. Be fair and respect other players and your teammates, too. No one wants his/her team to lose the game.  

practice.  focus on your weak points.  believe in yourself.  play a variety of shots and strokes.  set goals.  guess bowling strategies.  become well-versed in the tricks.  watch matches played all the way out.  avoid being disappointed.  enjoy your game.

  Take the red cherries and cut into small shapes that would pass for a red winter berry. Don't fuss too much––just little shapes are adequate, and they don't have to be round.       Take the green cherries and cut into small leaf shapes. These should be larger than the cherry shapes you've already cut.  Help it melt faster by stirring occasionally but take care not to let any condensation drip back into the bowl.  Allow it to cool for 10 minutes. ,, This will end up looking like holly with a berry on each truffle. Place in mini paper cases if desired.  

make the cherry berries and leaves first.  melt the white chocolate inside a heatproof bowl over a small saucepan or in a double boiler over simmering water.  remove the melted chocolate from the heat.  drizzle the white chocolate topping over each truffle to appear like custard.  ,  arrange the berry cherry in the middle top of each truffle.  ,  align two leaves next to one another at an angle from the berry cherry. 

 Pour 2 to 4 Tbsp (30 to 60 ml) of pasteurized egg whites into a small, clean dish. Using a small, soft paintbrush, lightly and evenly brush these egg whites onto the surface of the fondant.   For safety reasons, you should use pre-separated, pasteurized egg whites from a carton. When working with small pieces, you can dip the fondant directly into the egg whites instead of brushing the egg whites over the piece. Tap off any excess before leaving the piece to dry. When you need to brush the fondant onto the piece, use a small brush and leave behind as few stroke marks as possible. Tap off any excess egg whites that pool in the crevices of the piece immediately after application.  Let the egg whites dry for several hours. Once dry, the fondant should have a natural, medium-level shine.   The egg whites must dry completely before you handle the piece. If you touch it while the whites are still drying, you may leave behind fingerprints that you won't be able to remove later. Note that the egg whites should dry to a semi-hard, permanent finish. Re-application should not be necessary.  If the fondant is not as shiny as you would prefer, you can apply additional coats following the same procedure.   Allow each coat to finish drying before applying the next coat. Doing so minimizes the risk of imprinting the egg whites with fingerprints or brush marks.  

apply pasteurized egg white to the fondant.  let it dry.  add further coats as needed. 

 Cleanse your skin thoroughly, wiping off any excess moisturizer. Dab your brows with translucent powder. The powder will give your makeup something to grip on to, allowing it to keep its definition and stay on longer.  Use a small, angled brush dipped in brow powder or eyeshadow to very lightly sketch the shape of an eyebrow. You can use the pencil trick from method one to determine precisely where your brow should begin, arch, and end, or you can eyeball it.         Drawing very lightly will allow you to easily erase the shape of the brow if you've made a mistake. You don't need it to be perfect--too precise an eyebrow won't look as natural., This is essential for drawing natural-looking hair. Keep a sharp point throughout the process, and make sure you sharpen when switching to your other brow.         Don't try this with an eyeliner pencil instead of a brow pencil--it will smear and rub off.  Use light, upward strokes to draw little fake hairs on top of the shaded brow you already drew. This layering will help create a 3-D effect and make your brows look more realistic.         Use a cotton swab to soften the edges a little, giving your brows a more natural look., Dab a little more powder over your drawn-on eyebrows and finish with a makeup or brow sealing solution. The powder and sealer will ensure your brows don't smudge or get rubbed or sweated off during the day.          If the sealer is too shiny, use a brush to lightly dust translucent powder over the area, dulling the shine., As an alternative to using a pencil everyday, you can get your brows temporary tattooed on in a process called microblading. Hairlike strokes will be tattooed on to look like additional eyebrow hair. Consult a professional to ask about trying this process. 

prepare your skin and brows.  sketch the shape of your eyebrow.  sharpen your pencil to an extra fine point.  draw in hair.  add makeup or brow sealing solution.  try microblading. 

 Keep the room you are in softly lit. Fluorescent lighting is considered bad for eyes since they give off the wrong light frequencies of color and emit radiation that makes you drowsy all day long.When reading, try to keep your light source located behind you and keep the light directed on the paper or the task you are working on. At work, or at a desk, use a shaded light source positioned on the desk in front of you. Again, keep the light directed towards your work and the shade will protect your eyes from direct light from the source. Avoid watching television or working on the computer in the dark.  Dry eye is caused by a lack of lubrication and moisture on the surface of your eye. Problems can range from minor irritant to serious inflammation of the tissues of the eye.Use a humidifier to moisturize your house or workspace. Adjust your thermostat to reduce air flow and dust particles that might irritate your eyes. Move your desk or office space if it is near a vent. Request moving to a different area of the office. Quit smoking because it can inflame your eyes. Consider stopping if you develop a dry eye condition. Use artificial tears if necessary to keep your eyes moist and lubricated.  Invest in the correct glasses or contact lenses for your specific situation. Nowadays, eyewear is made for nearly every situation so make sure to get a proper eye exam and talk to your optometrist about getting the correct prescription for the most likely environment where you will be wearing your glasses.Prescription and nonprescription lenses are made for nearly all types of lifestyles. There are different types of lenses for age, sports, and indoor and outdoor wear. If you work outside or have to drive long distances make sure to buy polarizing sunglasses to protect your eyes again UV light and glare. This will help prevent squinting. Make sure you wear glasses for as long as you need to and keep them clean.  Computers are a major source of eye strain for most people. Try to limit your screen time by routinely taking breaks, exercising your eyes, and keeping them hydrated.If you tend to stare when you use a computer remind yourself to blink often in order to produce tears that moisten and refresh your eyes. While you are on the computer practice the 20-20-20 rule: Every twenty minutes look at something twenty feet away for at least twenty seconds. Reduce glare on the screen to avoid straining your eyes. This means you should adjust lighting in front and behind you. Keep the monitor positioned directly in front of you at about arm’s length away. The screen should be approximately just below your eye level. Adjust your chair if necessary. Use the convenience of a paper holder so you can keep your eyes relatively on the same level as the computer screen. Reducing the amount of times your eyes have to readjust will lessen eye strain. Enlarge the font size, contrast, and brightness for easier reading and browsing. Keep your screen clear from dust.  

adjust the lighting.  improve air quality.  choose the right glasses.  limit computer usage. 

 A heavy person might play sports and eat a balanced diet, while a thin person might thrive upon junk food and late-night internet browsing. People of any size may have a disability affecting their ability to exercise or eat certain food groups. You can't see someone's habits just by looking at their weight.; , Look beyond "fat is bad:" what is the real reasoning you want to push someone to make such drastic changes? Why do the particulars of their body matter so much to you?   You want to take on the role of saving them from themselves You are physically disgusted by their weight, or by fat people in general You are embarrassed to be seen with someone fat You don't care about their weight; you just want them to be happy and treat themselves well  , If your friend is on the bigger side, they know. In fact, people probably won't stop telling them. Heavy people are at greater risk for mental health issues and low self-esteem, and reminding them how fat they are is not going to make it any better.   You are their friend, not a critic or a personal trainer. Criticizing their body won't help them. It's hard to take good care of something you hate, so don't encourage them to hate their body.  A good friend likes their friend for whom they already are, not for whom they might someday become. Focus on accepting the whole package, including their weight. What is good about your friend: their sense of humor, their compassion, their skill at theater?  

don't assume that you understand someone's habits just because you see how large they are.  ask why you want to change their habits.  never criticize someone's weight, implicitly or explicitly.  accept them as they are. 

 Pack it full. Next, pour in the oil until the jar is full. Put on the lid and shake vigorously.; , Remove the lid and smell. If the scent is not strong enough, replace the lid and shake again. Check the scent every day until the strength of the scent is what you want.  and strain the oil through a piece of cheesecloth into a clean jar. 

fill an 8 ounce jar with the flower, spice, leaves or bark.  place the jar in a warm, dark place and shake every day for at least one week.  strain out the hard matter, flowers, leaves, spices, etc.  finished.  

 Use a rattail comb to help make the part nice and neat. It does not matter which side you do the part on.This method will give you a braided crown with a flower headband secured into it.; , Gather a small section of hair from the thicker side of the part. Split it into three strands. Cross the left strand under the middle one, then cross the right strand under the middle one.   Do not cross the strands over the middle one, or your Dutch braid won't turn out right.  Dutch braiding is just like French braiding, but in reverse. Instead of crossing the side strands over the middle one, you cross them under. Gather hair from your hairline when adding it to the front strand. Gather hair from just behind the back strand before adding it in., Continue adding hair from your hairline to the front strand. When you braid down the side of your head, gather hair from your part before adding it to the back strand. Stop when you reach your ear., You can also use a hair clip instead. Don't worry how it looks; this is just temporary.  Gather your hair up into a half-up, half-down ponytail. Twist and clip it out of the way. Again, don't worry about how it looks; you will be letting your hair down shortly.  You can use any type you want; the ribbon kind that you tie in the back work the best. If you choose a stiff crown, like a tiara, make sure that it doesn't have flowers in the back. Secure the headband with bobby pins if needed.Choose a flower headband that matches your style and outfit.  Unclip and untwist your half-up, half-down ponytail. Let it down so that it covers the back of the headband, where the ties or bobby pins are.  Keep gathering hair from your hair line and adding it to the bottom strand. Gather the hair that you let down, and add it to the top strand. When you reach the side of your head, gather hair from your part before adding it to the top strand.If your headband has any ties, add them to the braid.You will be braiding upward in this step. If you are having a had time, try bending forward so that your head is pointing towards the ground.  When you are back to where you started, you won't have any more hair left to do a Dutch braid. Switch to doing a regular braid. Tie it off with a clear hair elastic., This time, wrap the braid behind the flower crown. Secure the end of the braid with bobby pins., If you want a more tousled look, gently tug on the outer loops of your Dutch braid to fluff it up. You can also muss up the hair at your temples for a boho look., If you have any flyaways, smooth them down before the hairspray sets. 

create side part above your eyebrow.  start braiding away from side part.  begin dutch braiding across your forehead.  continue braiding until you reach your ear dutch braid across your forehead and down the side of your head.  secure the braid with a bobby pin.  pull your hair out of the way.  add a flower headband.  let down your ponytail.  continue braiding around bottom of your head and up the side.  finish off with a normal braid.  wrap the braid around the top of your head.  fluff the braid up, if desired.  mist your hair with hairspray. 

 This step is exactly like in the section above. Cover the bottom and sides of an 8x8 or 9x9 baking pan with parchment or aluminum foil. Spray lightly with a cooking spray or rub with butter.  You can do this in the microwave, but if you have the time, using a double boiler usually works best. See our article on double boilers for more information. In either case, low, gentle heat works best to prevent the white chocolate from burning or seizing.  Pour the milk, dulce de leche, melted white chocolate, vanilla, butter, golden syrup, and sugar into a pot over medium-low heat. Stir to combine. When the ingredients form a smooth, thick mixture, increase the heat to reach a boil.   Don't have a can of dulce de leche? Don't worry — you can make your own with a can of condensed milk. Click here.  Reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Let the caramel simmer as you stir for about 10 minutes until you reach a rich golden color.If you smell smoke or notice your caramel becoming a darker, orange-brown color, remove it from the heat immediately.  Expect to beat the caramel for about three to five minutes. When it reaches a thick but smooth consistently, it's ready.   Just like in the recipe above, you can use an electric mixer or a spoon. In either case, be sure to wear protective mitts or gloves to prevent burns from caramel splatters.  Transfer to the fridge to cool. It should be firm but chewy after a few hours.  The caramel should come easily out of the pan with the parchment or foil. Use a kitchen knife to cut the fudge block into small cubes. It should be ready to eat immediately.  Dulce de leche is a thick, brown, caramel-flavored spread that comes in a can and is found in the "Hispanic Foods" section of most grocery stores. It's perfect for caramel fudge recipes, but if you don't have any, it's easy to make from ordinary condensed milk. Follow the steps in this subsection to make your own., Start by removing the can's label. Set the can on its side in a large soup pot or dutch oven. Add water to the pot until it covers the pan generously (at least two inches above it).   This is crucial — if you don't cover the can with water completely, it can rupture or explode.  Heat the pot to a boil, then reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Don't forget to reduce the heat. If you do, the condensed milk can burn.  The exact amount of time you will need to cook the can for is a matter of taste. Generally, you'll want to simmer for about two to three hours (the longer you cook it, the darker and more bitter it will be).   Check the water level occasionally — the can must always be submerged completely, so add more water as needed.  Careful — it will be hot. Use a slotted spoon or a pair of tongs to protect yourself. Let the can cool to room temperature before opening.    Don't open it while it's hot. Because of the built-up pressure in the can, this can cause it to sputter hot dulce de leche at you.  

line a pan.  melt the white chocolate.  combine all ingredients in saucepan and bring to boil.  simmer, stirring constantly.  beat until smooth and thick.  pour into lined baking pan.  cut into squares and serve.  grab a can of condensed milk.  set the can in a pot of water.  boil the water with the can in it.  let simmer for several hours.  remove the can. 

 Sometimes a more earnest response is a better one — an insulting comeback can end up provoking more of the same (or worse). You still, however, need to show the bully that you aren't hurt by his words, even if you are.   Take a deep breath. If you are angry, try to let the feeling go. Anger is what the bully wants to see, so don't give in and show it.Try to put on a "poker face" that doesn't reveal any feelings one way or the other. You can practice this in the mirror at home to make this easier.  When you respond to the bully, show that you are confident. It's not just that you aren't angry or hurt — you feel fine about yourself and and confident in your response.Stand up straight, and look the bully in the eye. Speak in a calm, clear voice. You can tell the person insulting you something like: "Your words don't affect me," or, "I don't let people like you get to me.", Respond verbally with a comment that shows that the insult hasn't hurt you, or that the bully's words are unimportant to you. Here are some good examples:I heard you, but I don't care. You're wasting your breath. Real mature. Are you done? Wow, you discovered I look different than you.  You might consider a response that promotes feelings of shame for the bully. Ideally, you can make her feel bad for insulting you. Here are some examples:I feel sorry for you. Build up your self-esteem some other way. Your parents must be really proud of you. It's sad that you feel a need to do this.  Some people have found it effective to respond to insults with questions aimed at making the other person open up about the real problem. If you think the person insulting you might be open to a conversation about the real issues that are upsetting him, this might be worth a try.For example, if someone calls you stupid, you might respond by asking: "What is it exactly that makes you feel I am not intelligent?" Even if this doesn't start a heart-to-heart conversation about the bully's own feelings of inadequacy or jealousy, it might disarm him just by being unexpected.  

take a breath.  act confident.  show you aren't hurt.  consider shaming the other person.  ask questions to start a conversation. 

 It can be difficult and requires a lot of passion and attention. If you don't really want to, it will make it difficult. Find your interest point. Why do you enjoy studying anatomy?; , Anatomy is difficult to remember. You need to develop a knowledge of it and keep this knowledge alive.   If you have a phone, try downloading anatomy games. If you have an Android or iPhone, an awesome app to use is "Speed Anatomy". Make flashcards. It is better to make your own flashcards because it is your knowledge bolstering your understanding. If you like, you can add pictures/diagrams and even include definitions. Watch videos. Take a break from reading and watch videos. They show how it is really is, up close. Moreover, you'll hear an exact way on how to pronounce all of the terminology. Numerous studies show that people learn more from visual learning then reading., Volunteer at your local hospital or clinic. If you can't do that, go online and play virtual surgery games.  If you don't use it, you lose it. If you share what you know more people will get interested and you feel a sense of importance.  Expand your knowledge. Keep informed about current medical issues. Try writing a mini-book on a topic. Try to focus on one disease that doesn't have a cure and make your own health discovery.  Get into it. 

be certain that you really want to study anatomy.  study a lot.  get into it.  work with others and share your knowledge.  practice a lot.  get tools like microscopes and actual scans. 

 Use an emery board if necessary to file off any broken pieces and for daily nourishment, always wash and moisturise with a rich hand cream.; , Only bother with Pedicures if you are going to maybe be barefoot or feel like it as nail polish on your toes can sometimes be forgotten and chipped nail polish,anywhere, never looks good. You could try having an indulgent manicure once a week. Start by washing and moisturizing hands with soap or cream. Cut nails and file, but be careful not to trim to deep or cut your fingers, as they can feel sore the next day. If you are going to be wearing very dark or bright nail polish, try to use a base coat ( clear nail polish- you can use for top coat if needed too) and leave to dry. Remember to sit still! Now paint on your chosen color (if added) and wait to dry again.  For smudge free nails, sit still for at least 10 minutes and always remove polish with nail varnish remover as soon as the paint starts to chip. -  , Just keep your hands nice if nail polish isn't allowed. Wash, moisturise and trim ( long nails get in the way of your busy day and class schedule) then paint on your nail polish by doing one thick stripe in the middle and two thinner ones at the side. Do one hand, wait to dry than the next. This look is really subtle but still really pretty. , Cutting nails is very important for this as long oval nails can take away the effect and small splashes of color. Use the same nail painting technique as before and leave to dry. , Both of these looks are just paint effects.  Using a green nail polish, do some soft zigzags round the top of nail and leave to dry. Next, very carefully ( maybe using a cotton bud or cuticle stick, depending on the thickness), dot white spots over the red but still so its more of the shade underneath. This is the fruit, the leaves and the seeds. Repeat all.  Take one color and paint one thick stripe through the middle of the nail. Now with two different shades, do two thin stripes down the side. Repeat all.  

care for your hands and nails- once a week cut nails if they are getting to long or collecting dirt underneath, short square shaped nails look most natural.  manicures are when you do the nails on your hands, pedicures are when you do your feet.  now you know the basic manicure, here are some classy and casual nail looks, and a few nail art designs which are all relatively easy to achieve.  sassy at school- most schools prefer it if you don't wear nail color but clear and sheer shades are normally allowed.  shades to try- clear,soft sparkly brown, sheer brown or pale pink.  ,  stepping into spring- bright colors and stand out shades are the way to go for this look!,  shades to try- bright blue, pink and purple,soft coral and rich red.  ,  cool nail art- normally you would consider nail art with lots of fussy stickers and jewels but effective art doesn't always mean adding little bits and pieces even though it can look very good.  strawberry- paint your nails are dark red shade and leave to dry.  stripes- paint your nails with a clear polish and leave to dry ( so your next shades still have something to cling onto). 

 With most common viruses and with most healthy adults, viral infections clear without additional treatment. If, however, an individual’s immune system is compromised, a doctor should be called as soon as any symptoms of infection occur. Immune compromise can occur in the very young, older individuals, those infected with HIV/AIDs, individuals who have had an organ transplant and cancer patients going through chemotherapy. Watch for these common symptoms of viral infections:   Fever Joint aches and pains Sore throat Headache Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea Skin rash Fatigue Nasal congestion  , If any of the common viral infection symptoms becomes severe, call a physician immediately. If a physician is not available, call for emergency services. , If you experience any of the following symptoms at any time, go to your nearest emergency room.Any change in your alertness or level of consciousness Chest pain A deep chest cough that produces wet or liquid yellow, green or brownish phlegm (discharge) Lethargy or unresponsiveness to stimuli (sounds, light, touch) Any form of seizure Any shortness of breath, wheezing, or any difficulty breathing A stiff or sore neck, or a severe headache Yellowing of the skin or the sclera (the whites of the eyes)  , Specific treatment always depends on the specific virus. There are hundreds of different viruses that are known to infect humans. Many can be largely prevented with vaccination, such as influenza, chicken pox, shingles and others.   Talk with your doctor about getting vaccinated against certain viruses.  If you experience symptoms that you think may be a viral infection for more than 48 hours without getting relief from the approaches listed, make an appointment to see your doctor as soon as possible. Many viral infections, like the common cold (rhinoviruses), the flu (influenza virus), measles (rubeola) or mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV), require primarily supportive treatment. Other viruses cause serious, life-threatening diseases such as cancer and Ebola. Some persistent viruses cause long-term disorders including hepatitis, HSV and varicella-zoster (causing chickenpox and shingles) and HIV., Until relatively recently, there were no effective antiviral drugs. That is changing, with more antiviral drugs being introduced.Antiviral therapy is important for certain infections, including infections with herpes viruses (HSVs), cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).   Another approach to treating viral infections is to use interferons. These are natural substances (cytokines) released from infected cells which function to block various facets of viral replication. Use of the interferons is particularly important in the treatment of the hepatitis viruses (B and C), Kaposi’s sarcoma associated with HIV infection, and a sexually transmitted infection called condyloma acuminata, which results in genital warts.  

see your doctor if your immune system is compromised.  call a doctor immediately if the common symptoms worsen.  seek immediate medical care if you experience certain severe symptoms.  get vaccinated.  visit your doctor if you don’t get relief from home remedies.  ask about antiviral drugs. 

 If you receive the ping report ping: cannot resolve example.com: Unknown host, it usually means that the you have misspelled the host name. Try another host name like “example.com”. If that reports “Unknown host,” then the problem is most likely the address of the domain name server.  If the problem is the address of the domain name server, ping using the host’s IP address instead of its name (e.g., 192.0.32.10). If this is successful then either the address you are using for the domain name server is incorrect or it is unreachable or down.   If you receive the ping report ping: sendto: No route to host, this may mean the address of the gateway is incorrect or that the connection from your computer is not up and running.  Ping 127.0.0.1 This is the IP address of your own computer. If this fails, the network configuration or the NIC (Network Interface Card) may be bad. Replace the NIC or add a new one.  If you are connected directly to your router, check the cable from your computer to your router, especially if the connection worked previously. If the Ethernet cable came loose, it could be causing the connection to fail.   If you are connecting wirelessly, ensure that you are properly connected to the network, and that the correct security password has been entered.  Most computer NIC ports have an indicator light that indicates a good connection and one that blinks as data is transferred. As the ping command transmits packets at about 1 per second, you should be able to see the data light blink.  Check that the router’s indicator light is lighting up properly (and no faults), including the one that indicates a good connection to your computer. If a fault indicator is on, follow the cable from your computer to the router to make sure it is properly connected, then call your cable or broadband provider if necessary.  

try another host name.  use the host’s ip address instead of its name.  ping your own computer.  check the network connection.  check the nic port's indicator light.  check the router. 

 Choose a black dry erase marker, or the darkest color you own. Cover the permanent ink completely with the dry erase ink, which contains a solvent that may dissolve the stain. Give it a few seconds to dry, then erase with a paper towel or clean white board eraser.If the white board or eraser are not reasonably clean (apart from the permanent ink), this method may leave smudges. These can be removed with any of the steps described below. You may repeat this method until the ink stain is fully removed. If you see no sign that the ink is coming off after two attempts, try one of the steps below.; , Most inks are made liquid by an alcohol solution. Fill a spray bottle or dampen a cloth with a small amount of 70% isopropyl alcohol or 100% ethyl alcohol. Place the whiteboard in a location with good air flow, and apply the alcohol over the stain. Wipe the board dry with a dry, clean, non-abrasive cloth, using a circular motion to loosen the ink.Rinse the whiteboard with a slightly damp paper towel, then dry with a second towel or cloth.   Warning: pure alcohol is flammable. Keep away from heat and ignition sources. Plenty of household products contain alcohol and can be used for this purpose. If you don't have rubbing alcohol, try using hand sanitizer, hair spray, aftershave, or perfume. Avoid products that contain coloring or feel sticky to the touch.  If none of the above methods work, use acetone or nail polish remover, which contains mostly acetone. This is a harsh chemical that creates dangerous, flammable fumes, so always work in an area with good air flow. Apply to the stain with a cloth, rub clean, then rinse the board with water and dry. This may cause damage to whiteboards with a lacquer finish or a wooden frame, but is one of the most effective methods for removing stains.If acetone gets on your eye, immediately wash your eye under lukewarm, gently flowing water for 15 minutes. Hold your eyelid open and do not stop to remove contact lenses.Acetone on your skin should be washed off for 5 minutes, but is unlikely to cause harm beyond irritation.  Many of these solutions are little more than rubbing alcohol, but much more expensive. If your white board won't respond to any of the above treatments, purchase a high quality cleaning product recommended by white board manufacturers, such as MB10W Whiteboard Cleaner., Some people report success with an abrasive cleaner such as baking soda, toothpaste, scouring powders, or harsher chemicals. While this may remove the stain, it could also damage the white board surface, making future dry erase ink harder to erase. Many ammonia-based household cleaning products such as Windex are suitable for daily cleaning, but not recommended for heavy application.While soapy water or white vinegar will remove light stains, they are unlikely to get rid of any marks your dry erase marker cannot. 

trace over the permanent ink with a dry erase marker.  if that doesn't work, try rubbing alcohol.  use acetone or nail polish remover if the stain persists.  purchase a whiteboard cleaning solution if necessary.  be skeptical of other solutions. 

 Since you will seeing a vet that is not your regular doctor, you will need to provide some medical and shot records. If you make the appointment far enough in advance, you may be able to provide the new vet with the contact information for your other doctor, and they can retrieve the necessary information themselves.At the bare minimum, you will need to show that your animals shots are up to date. If your vet has run tests regarding your pet's condition, the results of these tests will be very helpful to your new vet.  When you go in for the appointment with your new vet, you are going to need to provide some information about your cat and their condition.Be ready to explain:  Your cat's age and medical history. What symptoms your cat is experiencing. When these symptoms began. What diagnosis the first vet provided. What treatments have been rendered and when. What medications your cat is currently taking (or has taken for this problem). Any other health problems your cat has been diagnosed with.  Before you agree to any treatment plan, inquire about the cost. Some services and treatments can be quite expensive, particularly specialized care. Many animals clinics will require you to put down 50% of the anticipated cost of treatment before services are provided. Make sure that you can afford treatment before you agree to anything. 

bring all necessary records.  be ready to answer some questions.  ensure your ability to pay. 

 This is a color-coded table that organizes all the known elements by atomic structure. Each element has a 1, 2, or 3-letter abbreviation and is listed along with its atomic weight and atomic number.Periodic tables can easily be found in chemistry books and online.; , The elements are ordered by atomic number and separated into three main groups: metals, non-metals, and metalloids (semi-metals). They are further grouped into families including alkali metals, halogens, and noble gases.Every column of the table is called a group and every row is called a period.   If you know the details of your element, such as what group or period it is in, it will be easier to locate. If you don’t know anything about the element in question, just search the table for its symbol until you find it.  The atomic number appears in the upper left-hand corner, above the element symbol in the square. The atomic number defines the number of protons present in that particular element.Protons are the particles in an element that provide a positive charge. Because electrons are negatively charged, when an element is in its neutral state, it will have the same number of protons as electrons.   For instance, boron (B) has an atomic number of 5, meaning that it has 5 protons and 5 electrons.  

obtain a periodic table of elements.  find the element in question on the periodic table.  find the atomic number of an element. 

 Sometimes the box will be left at your shipping location, so you will not have a choice to refuse the package.  Look for instructions on how to return the merchandise.  Enclose the return request in your package.  Request a receipt so that you can prove that you shipped the box.   It is a good idea to get a delivery signature and a tracking number when making returns. The shipping costs to receive the goods and send them back are usually the responsibility of the buyer. Check the returns section of your packing slip to see if the company offers free returns. If they do, ensure you drop the package off at the location they use for free return shipping, such as FedEx or UPS.  

receive the box if the order has been completed and shipped to you.  open the package.  make a copy of the return receipt for your records.  ship it with the pre-addressed shipping label and drop it off at a shipping agent location or ship it via the local post office. 

 You need to get to a pretty tall spot, and look around for the Nether Quartz Ore. Then go to it and use your pickaxe to mine it; each ore should drop 1 Nether Quartz (more if your pickaxe is enchanted with Fortune).  4 Nether Quartz pieces put in a square in the crafting table give you 1 Block of Quartz, a whitish block. Quartz Blocks are only used for decoration; they have no unique characteristics.   A way to search for Nether Quartz Ore is to create a corridor inside the Netherrack. Every set amount of blocks, create smaller channels of 4-5 blocks to the sides of the main corridor. This exposes you to the most amount of blocks, increasing your chances of find Nether Quartz Ore.  

find nether quartz ore. nether quartz ore spawns fairly commonly in the nether, but the blocks aren't very close together.  collect a lot of nether quartz. 

 Hands down, the best way to learn a new language is to speak it. Too often, people spend all of their time studying grammar and memorizing lists of words instead of actually going out there and putting what they've learned into practice. Speaking with a real, live person will help you to feel much more motivated about learning the language than staring at a book or computer screen.   Try to find a friend or colleague who speaks the language you wish to learn and who'd be willing to sit down with you and help you practice. Alternatively, you could try putting ads in local online forums or newspapers to find someone to tutor you or participate in a language exchange. If you can't find anyone who speaks your language nearby, try to connect with someone on Skype. People in foreign countries are often willing to exchange half an hour of speaking in their native tongue for half an hour of speaking in English. A Hellotalk account is another option.; , People often claim to have studied a language "for five years" and still not be fluent. But when they say five years, they probably mean that they studied the language for only a couple of hours a week over that entire time period. Let's get one thing clear -- if you want to learn a new language quickly -- that is, in the space of a few weeks or months -- you're going to have to commit to studying the language for a couple of hours per day.   Language learning is based on repetition -- hammering something into your brain over and over again until you remember it. If you break too long between study sessions, you are much more prone to forget what you learned last time and you will waste valuable study time going back over what you've already learned. You can cut down on this wasted time by studying every day. There are no miraculous short cuts when it comes to language learning -- you just need to commit.  Carrying a dictionary with you will save you a lot of time and frustration, so invest in one as soon as possible!   It can be an actual, physical dictionary, or a dictionary app on your phone -- you just need to be able to consult it quickly whenever you need a word. Carrying a dictionary will allow you to find the necessary word at a moments notice. This is especially important when you are having a conversation with a native speaker and don't wish to disrupt the flow of conversation by not being able to remember a word. In addition, looking up the word and using it immediately in a sentence will help you to commit the word to memory. You can also peruse the dictionary at random moments throughout the day -- when you're waiting in line at the grocery store, when you're on a coffee break at work, or sitting in traffic. You could learn an extra 20 or 30 words a day this way!  , Immersing yourself in a language means doing all of the activities you would normally do in your native tongue, through your new language -- whether that's reading, writing or listening.   Possibly the easiest thing you can do is watch television shows or movies in the language you are trying to learn. Try to avoid subtitles, as you will tend to rely on them. To make things easier, try to watch shows or movies whose plots you are already familiar with -- like kids' cartoons or dubbed versions of English movies -- knowing the context will help you to decipher the meanings of words and phrases. You should also attempt to read and write in your new language. Get a newspaper or magazine and attempt to read one article a day -- looking up any words you don't understand in your dictionary. You should also try to write a few simple things in your new language --whether it's a pretend postcard or a shopping list. Download podcasts or tune in to radio stations in your new language. This is a great way to immerse yourself in the language while you're on the go. Not only does this help with your listening comprehension, it also allows you to hear the correct pronunciation of common words and phrases. Change your language settings on all your electronic devices so that you can pick up words you know already in English but not in the new language. Listen to songs in that language. Try to learn the lyrics, then check what they mean. That way, if you hear it again, you can tell what the conversation is about at that point.  Obviously, it would be a great boost to your language learning skills if you could visit and spend some time in a country where your new language is spoken.   Force yourself to interact with the locals -- whether you're asking for directions, completing a transaction in a store, or simply saying hello -- and you will gain a new appreciation of the language and its speakers. It doesn't matter how basic your oral skills are, keep pushing yourself to speak and you will soon notice a vast improvement in your vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation.  

connect with a native speaker.  study the language every day.  carry a dictionary at all times.  watch, listen, read and write in your chosen language.  visit a country where your chosen language is spoken.

 It is normal and healthy to experience bad moods every now and again. But if your bad mood lasts for more than two weeks or if it is seriously infringing on your ability to function, you should talk to your doctor about it.There is a possibility that you have a physical disorder, such as an abnormal thyroid, which will require medical treatment., Some people experience clinical depression, which is more serious than a typical bad mood. Depression can cause physical as well as mental distress and hurt someone's ability to work, sleep, or function normally. If you cannot shake your feelings of distress, or if you are considering hurting yourself or someone else, you should seek mental health care as soon as possible.Remember that depression is an illness that requires treatment, just like a physical disorder. It is perfectly normal to need the help of antidepressant medication or talk therapy to recover., Some women experience difficult, serious bad moods during the days leading up to their periods. This is known as Premenstrual Syndrome or PMS. If you feel like your PMS is hurting your ability to function in a healthy and happy way, talk with your doctor about whether you might benefit from hormonal birth control. Many women report an improvement in PMS symptoms and in their moods while on hormonal birth control.Note that hormonal birth control can have side effects that are potentially serious. Talk carefully with your doctor about your options.  If your bad moods take place during the dark winter months, coupled with increased irritability and anxiety and lower energy, it is possible that you are experiencing Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). SAD is caused by the lack of sunlight and can be effectively treated with light therapy, talk therapy, and antidepressants. Be sure to talk about these options with your doctor. 

talk to your physician about sustained bad moods.  consider seeing a therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist about sustained bad moods.  consider hormonal birth control.  talk to your doctor about seasonal affective disorder.

 Preheat the oven to 160ºC (320ºF) and place a rack in the center position.; , Take 115g (½ cup) salted butter on the cool side of room temperature, workable but not melting. Cut it into small chunks and add to a mixing bowl.Most of the flavor of shortbread comes from butter, so using a fresh, high-quality product can make a big difference. The traditional choice is a European-style butter, which has a little more fat than American-style.If you only have unsalted butter, just add a pinch of salt to the recipe. It won't mix in quite as well since shortbread dough is so dry, but it's not a major problem., The recipe calls for 55g (¼ cup) sugar, but which type you use depends on your preferred texture. The most popular choices are caster sugar, for a sandy texture, or icing sugar, for a smooth, melt-in-your-mouth shortbread.Whichever you choose, add the sugar gradually as you beat it into the butter, until light and fluffy.   This takes about three minutes with an electric mixer's paddle attachment on low speed, or a bit longer by hand.In the U.S. and some other countries, caster sugar is called "superfine", and icing sugar is "powdered" or "confectioner's." You may use granulated sugar, but the recipe sometimes ends up a little gritty.  Sift 130g (1 cup) plain flour and 40g (¼ cup) rice flour together to remove all lumps. Mix this into the butter mixture just long enough for it to form a soft, crack-free dough.If this takes more than six or seven minutes, slowly dribble in water, but no more than 15 mL / 1 tbsp.Electric mixers and food processors can overwork the dough, making it tough. If you use one, keep it on low and finish it by hand.The warmth of your hands helps bind the dough together. Rice flour (also sold as ground rice or rice powder) encourages the signature sandy texture. In a pinch, the shortbread should still turn out fine if you replace it with additional ordinary flour., Let the paper hang over the edges so you can easily remove the shortbread. A single batch of this recipe should fit a 15cm (6 inch) pan.This baking method makes a thick circle of shortbread with a soft center.You can use a special shortbread mold instead to make shortbread with a patterned surface. If you do, dust the mold with icing sugar and place it in the fridge., Press the dough into the pan and pat it flat, minimizing the handling time. If you'd like a smoother surface, cover the dough with plastic wrap and roll over it gently with a pastry roller or a lightweight jar., Cover the pan in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge for fifteen minutes (or even a full hour, if you're a perfectionist).This will improve the texture of the shortbread.  Poke the top of the shortbread with a fork, outlining eight or sixteen wedge-shaped slices on the surface. Poke the surface of each slice in several places as well. Besides looking decorative, these holes allow steam to escape, preventing cracking or bubbling.This wedge shape is a traditional presentation for shortbread, called "petticoat tails.", The shortbread is ready at the very first sign of golden brown at the edge, or even just before. It will take longer to bake in a smaller pan, since the dough is thicker.  Let cool for a few minutes, then transfer out of the pan using parchment paper. Cut into slices while still warm, using a knife or pizza roller. Place slices onto a cooling rack to cool to room temperature, then serve or refrigerate in an airtight container.   Optionally, sprinkle with extra sugar.  Form the dough into a log with your hands, with minimal handling. You'll be slicing this log into rounds, so estimate the size of biscuit you'd like to make.   If your hands are warm, it's best to avoid further handling of the dough. Instead, roll the dough onto parchment paper and cut out rounds with cookie cutters. Dust the rolling pin with icing sugar instead of flour, if you have it., Cover the dough in plastic wrap and place in the fridge. Let chill for at least fifteen minutes, preferably 30 to 60, in order to prevent spreading in the oven., The thickness can be anywhere from 5mm (1/5") for crisp biscuits, to 12mm (nearly 1/2") for chewy, soft-in-the-center rounds.  Poke a fork once or twice into the top of each round. This lets steam escape through the holes instead of bubbling or breaking the shortbread.  Place the rounds on a lined baking tray. Check on them around the 12 minute mark, especially if the round are thin. They are ready when set but still pale, or when pale golden if you prefer them crisp. Remove them immediately if they look brown, since the underside cooks faster than the top.  Transfer to a wire rack and let cool. Sprinkle in sugar before eating for a sweeter, sparkling biscuit.   Pack leftovers in an airtight tub and eat within a couple weeks. 

prepare the oven.  add cool butter to a mixing bowl.  cream the butter and sugar together.  sift in flour and mix into a dough.  line a circular pan with parchment paper.  pat the dough gently into the pan.  chill the dough (recommended).  score dotted lines with a fork.  bake for 35–60 minutes.  cut and let cool.  pat into a log shape.  let chill in the refrigerator.  slice into rounds.  poke the tops with a fork.  bake for about 15 minutes.  let cool before eating. 

 Carob is generally available in health food stores. It comes in the following forms:   Powder Carob chips or drops Bars; , It might be as simple as your preference for the taste. One of the main reasons for preferring it over chocolate is that a person has allergies or unpleasant reactions to chocolate. Chocolate causes headaches and some other reactions in sensitive persons. In this case, carob can be substituted without the side effects of chocolate. Another reason is simply that carob adds its own taste dimension to food.  Carob does not taste like chocolate, so don't expect miracles. However, carob can be used in some of the ways that we use chocolate (such as coating raisins, almonds etc.) and as explained above, you can use less or no sugar with carob. Here are some possible substitute ideas:   Use the powder instead of cocoa powder; Use in place of hot chocolate powder (the sweetness and lack of dairy products is good for those with dietary restrictions); Substitute carob chips for chocolate chips in cookie and ice cream recipes; Use in a variety of baked goods in place of sugar. It will impart a slight brown colouring, as well as its own flavour but you can make the most of its fifty percent content of natural sugar to avoid added sugar content.  Unlike chocolate, which is very dangerous for dogs, cats, and other pets, carob can be used in their treats without ill effect. Doggy chocs should really be doggy carob drops.  

purchase the carob.  work out why you prefer to use carob over chocolate.  use carob as a chocolate substitute.  cook with carob for pet treats. 

   Keep your hand in one place. Pause noticeably between individual words. Avoid long nails or excessive jewelry, as it can be distracting to someone reading your hands. When finger-spelling an acronym, move each letter in a small circle to let the reader know that they should not be read together as one word. Don't bounce your hand between letters, unless there are two letters, in which case the bounce indicates the repetition of the signed letter (dragging the letter slightly to the side can also indicate repetition). Bouncing between every individual letter can make your finger-spelling difficult to understand. To prevent this from happening, hold your wrist with your free hand to prevent it from moving up and down when you practice. After a while, you'll get used to keeping your hand still without thinking about it. Face your palm forward, except when you're signing the letters "G", "H" "C" and "O"(in which case the palm should face sideways). Keep your finger-spelling hand at shoulder height. Keep a consistent pace. Don't try to rush through finger-spelling. The more important thing is to sign each letter at a consistent rhythm (but without bouncing!) so that the reader can easily distinguish a pause. It's better to go slow and steady than to rush and suddenly pause when you can't remember a sign--the reader may misinterpret this as the beginning of a new word.  

some tips for good form. 

 Get a jet pack from your nearest army depot. If you can't find a jet pack just strap two rockets on your back. Just be careful not to burn your feet or your cape.; , Since it would require years of training to reach even a fraction of what is considered to be superhuman strength you could get a pressurized gas tank. Just open it and unleash! (Side note: Lifting buses will be harder but still plausible)  , Purchase a portal gun and Portal 2. Learn how to use the aforementioned gun by playing the aforementioned game.  Remember that rocket (a missile is even better) from step 1? Just ride it like a surfer board. Just don't ask me how to stop.  Grab an inflatable costume. When you want to shape shift just enter the costume and blow it up.  The pressurized gas tank from step 2 could easily be mistaken for telekinesis. Therefore just use it to that end.  Any superconductor will do the trick. Just make sure you always carry plenty of batteries. Otherwise use conventional super sized magnet.  That gas tank again! See? It's so useful you might actually want to carry two on you at any given moment.  Stare your foe until he sleeps or throw a sleeping pill in his drink. If neither is feasible just hurl a rock at his head. Works every time!

 Put one set of quotation marks around these titles to off set it properly. Only put quotations around the title, not the author’s name.For example, if you were citing the poem One Art by Elizabeth Bishop, it would appear as “One Art” by Elizabeth Bishop. If you were citing the short story Ironhead by Aimee Bender, it would appear as “Ironhead” by Aimee Bender. If you were citing the chapter The Boy Who Lived from Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone by J.K. Rowling, it would appear as “The Boy Who Lived” from Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone by J.K. Rowling.  Always use quotation marks when citing the title of an article or essay in a journal, magazine, or online publication. Capitalize all of the words that are not articles in the title and use one set of quotation marks around the title only.For example, if you were citing the article The President Wants to Keep Us in the Dark by Marc Decosta, it would appear as “The President Wants to Keep Us in the Dark” by Marc Decosta. If you were citing the essay The Fourth State of Matter by Jo Ann Beard, it would appear as “The Fourth State of Matter” by Jo Ann Beard.  For example, if you were talking about an episode of Friends called The One With the Blackout, it would appear as “The One With the Blackout.” If you were discussing the song Tangled Up in Blue by Bob Dylan, it would appear as “Tangled Up in Blue” by Bob Dylan., Plays should always be cited with quotation marks. For example, if you were discussing the play The Crucible by Arthur Miller, it would appear as “The Crucible” by Arthur Miller.  Do not use italics or underline the title of plays. If you are citing a collection of plays by the same playwright, for example, The Collected Plays of Arthur Miller, you would use italics for the title, not quotation marks: The Collected Plays of Arthur Miller.  Do not put punctuation that is part of the sentence in the quotation marks with the title. Only include punctuation that is already part of the title in the quotation marks. For example:Did you like “The Crucible”? I read “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” by Edward Albee on the train today.  

use quotation marks for the titles of poems, short stories, and chapters in a book.  put quotation marks on the titles of articles and essays.  use quotation marks for television episodes and song titles.  apply quotation marks to the title of a play.  do not include punctuation in the quotation marks when quoting a title. 

 Independence is very important to a teenager. It comes as a necessity over time, but when teenagers start off being independent, it usually comes as a privilege from your parents. Figure out your home dynamics, and offer areas where your independence becomes helpful to your household: for example, cooking your meals, cleaning up after yourself, taking care of younger siblings, asking for less supervision, getting a part-time job, etc. As you gain more responsibility and independence, be aware that failure might occur and is to be expected. Learning from failure, however, will help you to grow., Getting from place to place does not always mean driving, but as a teenager, driving is a huge step in responsibility and independence. Be sure to take any courses and means to obtain a driver's license. Also, driving is not the only way to get around. Cities have public transportation that can be both cheap and accessible for teenagers. Learn the routes needed to get you from place to place. It will teach you time management and patience.  As you grow up, your city gets smaller, and the world gets bigger. Family vacations help you explore certain regions, but taking on world travel also helps build responsibility and independence. A younger person has more outlets to travel by such as study abroad, language exchange, or volunteer programs. If you have family in distant places, reconnect with a summer visit. The chance to travel gives experiences that build great character., Being responsible and independent does not mean being alone. Taking on new tasks and meeting goals will be hard work. Asking people for help shows maturity and confidence. Seek advice from parents, older siblings, mentors at work, teachers, or someone whom you trust. Opening up channels of communication at a young age is a great habit for success.

 Fill a large saucepan approximately halfway with water. Next, place a glass bowl in the pan to create a double boiler.  When you’ve set up the double boiler, add ¼ cup (50 g) of coconut oil and 2 tablespoons (28 g) of beeswax to the bowl. Place the pan on the burner, and heat on medium-low until the ingredients melt completely, which should take approximately 5 minutes.   The mixture will melt more quickly if you use beeswax pellets rather than a block of beeswax. Stir the mixture periodically as it’s melting to ensure that the coconut oil and beeswax combine completely.  Once the coconut oil and beeswax have melted, remove the pan from the heat. Stir the mixture again so it’s smooth. Next, stir in ⅛ cup (30 ml) of olive oil and whisk the ingredients until they are creamy but you can still pour them.   If you want to give your “Vaseline” a pleasant scent, you can whisk in two to three drops of tea tree, peppermint, or another essential oil.  When you’ve finished whisking the “Vaseline” mixture, carefully pour it into a glass jar or container with a lid. Let the “Vaseline” cool for two to three hours so it has time to solidify before you start using it.   The homemade “Vaseline” will stay fresh at room temperature for up to a year.  

pour water into a pan and place a glass bowl in the pan.  add the coconut oil and wax and heat until they melt.  take the pan off the heat and mix in the olive oil.  transfer the mixture to a container and allow it to cool. 

 If you prefer a stronger, more concentrated taste, stick with only 2 cups (500 milliliters) of filtered water. If you are unaccustomed to the taste of wheatgrass, however, or if you find it overpowering, dilute the juice more by using 3 cups (750 milliliters) of water instead. If you like, you can substitute the water with fresh-squeezed orange juice or coconut juice instead. This can give the wheatgrass shot you'll be preparing a bit more flavor.  Blending for about 60 seconds should suffice. You should be left with an emerald green juice with chunks of pulp floating at the surface.   Note that the grass may get tangled around the blades of the blender if the blades of grass are too long. This will not be an issue in most cases, and you can simply clean the blades of your blender after you finish getting the juice out. Pay attention to possible signs of trouble, though, like a slowing blade or the sounds of a struggling motor. If you suspect that the wheatgrass is clogging your blender, you may need to fish out the wayward wheatgrass before you continue blending.  The strainer should have fine gaps, and it should be no larger than the mouth of the bowl you place it over.  The cheesecloth should be large enough to hang over the sides of your strainer.  Most of the liquid should flow through without much effort on your part.  This juice should also flow through the cheesecloth and into the container. Continue pressing down on the wheatgrass until no more juice comes out.  The lemon is only optional, but it enhances the flavor of the wheatgrass while preserving the juice a little longer. Mix with a spatula or spoon to combine. This can be especially useful if you stick to water instead of using juice for your blended mix.  Serve it chilled or with ice. Wheatgrass can be best enjoyed in shot form.  

put 1/2 cup (113 grams) of chopped wheatgrass into a blender with 2 to 3 cups (500 to 750 milliliters) of filtered water.  blend the wheatgrass and water together using the highest speed.  place a mesh strainer over a clean glass bowl.  line the strainer with cheesecloth.  pour the wheatgrass from your blender through the cheesecloth and strainer.  using a rubber spatula, press down on the wheatgrass pulp to squeeze out additional juice.  squeeze juice from a lemon half into the bowl of wheatgrass juice.  transfer the wheatgrass from the container into glasses to enjoy. 

 Make sure your shampoo is sulfate-free and silicone-free, because sulfates can dry out curly hair even more, and silicones can build-up on curly hair.

 When you’re having a face-to-face conversation with a colleague, focusing on their eyes and face is the best way to let them know you’re listening. If you extend your officemates this courtesy, they’ll do the same for you.Some people may find it difficult or uncomfortable to look directly into others’ eyes. Try practicing on friends and family, or focus on a spot on your co-worker’s face that’s very near their eyes.  Slouching not only closes off your body, but it’s also associated with laziness and unprofessionalism. Try rolling your shoulders back a few times and opening your chest when you’re sitting and standing. You’ll look more approachable, and your back won’t hurt as much at the end of the workday.   If you’re unsure of what to do with your hands while speaking to another person, try resting them comfortably on your lap or on the table or desk in front of you. If you’re standing, try clasping them in front of you. Always square your shoulders and face directly toward the person you are communicating with.  If you’re waiting for a meeting to start, consider jotting down some notes rather than burying your nose in your phone. This will make it easy for you to immediately engage others in a conversation when they enter the room. Always keep your attention on the people with whom you’re communicating.

 The valance is L-shaped so the top surface can be mounted inside the upper frame and the front of the valance will hide the headrail.          Place the valance on a flat surface with the front of the valance in an upright position. Measure 3 inches (7.6 cm) from each end and position each bracket so the top edge is against the upright valance. Use a pencil to mark the 2 screw holes in each bracket. Predrill the four holes, with a smaller bit than the actual screws you will use for the screws (if possible).; , Mark holes for the brackets on the inside of the upper frame of the door or window.          Measure 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the side of the frame and 1 inch (2.5 cm) out from the glass. Hold the first bracket in place, place a screw in the first hole and tap with a hammer to make a mark. Make another mark in the second hold. Repeat on the other side for the second bracket.  Attach the valance and brackets to the inside frame.          Position the valance in the window so the marks you made in the upper frame are visible through the holes you drilled in the valance. Have a helper hold the valance while you attach the screws through the bracket and valance. Repeat. Repeat on the other side for the second bracket.  Snap the blinds head rail into the brackets by hooking the front end into the clip and then lifting the back end until it clicks into place.

 If you want your cherries on the super-tart side, add less sugar. You can also use a sugar substitute (like Splenda), honey, or agave syrup.   To get the cherry pits out, score them along their sides with a knife. You may be able to pop the pits right out -- or just take a butter knife and wedge them out if they're being difficult.; , The cherries need time to soak up the sweetness of the sugar. It'll be so tangy that you'll need the water to dilute it later.  You're looking for one mostly uniform consistency (the cherry chunks will keep it from being entirely uniform).  Then reduce the heat and simmer for fifteen minutes. It should maintain a light bubble the entire time, reducing the liquid and turning almost syrupy.  Squeeze all the moisture from the cherries into a separate saucepan. Don't just strain it -- really squeeze out all the juices.   You're finished with the cherries; you can throw them away. Or keep them for a topping or a preserve!  , Then take the pan off, let it cool to room temperature and move it to a sealed vessel for storage in a refrigerator. That's it!   The consistency is right; this is basically tart cherry juice concentrate. It's not supposed to be like juice -- it should be much thicker.  Sparkling water (or even just water) works, too. Feel free to experiment with the ratio to find your personal taste. It may take a try or two -- but once you find the right combination, it'll be easy.   Keep the rest in a resealable container to save for later. It'll keep for a couple weeks if kept tight and in the refrigerator.  

put the clean, seedless cherries and sugar in a saucepan.  cover the pan and leave at room temperature for 2 hours.  add the 1/2 pint of water and stir until all the sugar dissolves.  bring the contents up to a boil.  when finished, strain the mixture.  simmer the strained liquid until it thickens like maple syrup.  to serve this drink, put one or two spoons of it into a glass of soda water.

The order that you choose to mark the sides generally does not matter, unless something in the problem you are working on specifies it., Mark the three angles of the triangle with letters that correspond to the side lengths. For example, if you use capital letters A, B and C for the sides, then mark the angles with lower case letters a, b and c. You can also use lower case Greek letters α,β,and γ{\displaystyle \alpha ,\beta ,{\text{and }}\gamma }. Place these so they correspond with the labeled sides, so angle α{\displaystyle \alpha } is opposite side A, angle β{\displaystyle \beta } is opposite side B, and angle γ{\displaystyle \gamma } is opposite side C.One way to determine that a side is “opposite” a chosen angle is to make sure that it does not form one of the rays of the angle. If labeled correctly, angle α{\displaystyle \alpha } wll be formed by the two sides B and C. It will therefore be “opposite” side A.  Similarly, angle β{\displaystyle \beta } is formed by sides A and C and is opposite side B.  Angle γ{\displaystyle \gamma } is formed by sides A and B and is opposite side C.  Some math texts will use capital letters for the sides and lower case for the angles. Others do the opposite. It does not matter, as long as you are consistent.  In your problem, you must be given some side and angle measurements. You should mark these on your sketch of the triangle.You may be able to calculate one or more measurements using some rules of geometry.   For example, if you are told that the triangle is isosceles, then you are able to mark that two of the angles are equal, as well as the two corresponding sides.  As another example, if you are told that two angles are 40 and 75 degrees, you can then calculate the third angle to be 65 degrees, since all three angles must add up to 180 degrees.  The Sine Rule, also called the law of sines, is a rule of trigonometry that relates the sides of a triangle and its angle measurements. While most of trigonometry is based on the relationships of right triangles, the law of sines can apply to any triangle, whether or not it has a right angle.'  The law of sines is stated as follows:   Asin⁡α=Bsin⁡β=Csin⁡γ{\displaystyle {\frac {A}{\sin \alpha }}={\frac {B}{\sin \beta }}={\frac {C}{\sin \gamma }}}    The same rule can be rearranged to yield the following equivalent statements:   sin⁡αA=sin⁡βB=sin⁡γC{\displaystyle {\frac {\sin \alpha }{A}}={\frac {\sin \beta }{B}}={\frac {\sin \gamma }{C}}}     , For the law of sines to be useful, you must know the measurements of at least two angles and one side, or two sides and one angle. In either case, you must have at least one pair that consists of a side and its opposite angle.For example, the following combinations would be sufficient for the law of sines to apply:  Side A, Side B and angle α{\displaystyle \alpha }  Side A, Side C, and angle γ{\displaystyle \gamma }  Side B, angle β{\displaystyle \beta } and angle α{\displaystyle \alpha }    The following combinations are examples that would NOT be sufficient to apply the law of sines:  Side A, Side B and Side C. (This does not work because you have no angle measurement.)  Side A, Side B and angle γ{\displaystyle \gamma }. (This does not work because the known angle is not opposite either of the known sides.  Side B, angle α{\displaystyle \alpha } and angle γ{\displaystyle \gamma }. (This does not work because the known side is not opposite either of the known angles.)     , The law of sines works to help you find one piece of information about a triangle -- a side or an angle measurement -- if you know three others. While the full law of sines is written as a three-part equation, you only need to equate two for the rule to work.For example, if you know sides A and B and angle α{\displaystyle \alpha }, then you need the portion of the law of sines that says:   Asin⁡α=Bsin⁡β{\displaystyle {\frac {A}{\sin \alpha }}={\frac {B}{\sin \beta }}}    Notice the similarity of the law. It really doesn’t matter which label you use for any sides or angles. The important thing to remember is that you are comparing ratios. The ratio of any side to its opposing angle is equal to the ratio of any other side to its opposing angle.  Suppose you are given that side A is 12, angle α{\displaystyle \alpha } is 80 degrees, and angle β{\displaystyle \beta } is 40 degrees. Find the length of side B. You can mark these numbers on the triangle and set up the problem as follows:Asin⁡α=Bsin⁡β{\displaystyle {\frac {A}{\sin \alpha }}={\frac {B}{\sin \beta }}}   12sin⁡80=Bsin⁡40{\displaystyle {\frac {12}{\sin 80}}={\frac {B}{\sin 40}}}   , Use basic algebra to maneuver the unknown information to stand alone on either side of the equation. You can then reduce the problem to find the answer.12sin⁡80=Bsin⁡40{\displaystyle {\frac {12}{\sin 80}}={\frac {B}{\sin 40}}}   12sin⁡40sin⁡80=B{\displaystyle {\frac {12\sin 40}{\sin 80}}=B}   7.83=B{\displaystyle 7.83=B}  To find the value of the sine of an angle, such as sin⁡40{\displaystyle \sin 40} in the problem above, you can use most handheld calculators with trigonometric functions. Different calculators operate differently. With some calculators, you will enter your angle measurement first and then the "sin" button. With others, you will enter the "sin" button first and then the angle measurement. You will have to experiment with your calculator.   Alternatively, there are some tables available either in math books or online. With a trigonometry table, you can find your desired angle measure in one column and the corresponding value of sine, cosine or tangent in another column.  Suppose, as a different problem, that you know two sides and need to solve an unknown angle. You are given that side A is 10 inches long, side B is 7 inches long, and angle α{\displaystyle \alpha } is 50 degrees. You can use this information to find the measurement of angle β{\displaystyle \beta }. Set up the problem as follows:Asin⁡α=Bsin⁡β{\displaystyle {\frac {A}{\sin \alpha }}={\frac {B}{\sin \beta }}}   10sin⁡50=7sin⁡β{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{\sin 50}}={\frac {7}{\sin \beta }}}   sin⁡β=7sin⁡5010{\displaystyle \sin \beta ={\frac {7\sin 50}{10}}}   sin⁡β=7∗0.76610{\displaystyle \sin \beta ={\frac {7*0.766}{10}}}   sin⁡β=0.536{\displaystyle \sin \beta =0.536}   , In the above example, the law of sines provides the sine of the selected angle as its solution. To find the measure of the angle itself, you must use the inverse sine function. This is also called the arcsine. On a calculator, this is generally marked as sin−1{\displaystyle \sin ^{-1}}. Use this to find the measure of the angle.For the example above, the final step is as follows:   sin⁡β=0.536{\displaystyle \sin \beta =0.536}   β=arcsin⁡0.536{\displaystyle \beta =\arcsin 0.536}   β=32.4{\displaystyle \beta =32.4}.  Suppose you are told that angle α=30 degrees{\displaystyle \alpha =30{\text{ degrees}}}, angle β=50 degrees{\displaystyle \beta =50{\text{ degrees}}}, and side C, which connects them, is 10 inches long. Find the measurement of all sides and angles for the triangle.  First, you should recognize that you do not yet have enough information for the sine rule to apply. The sine rule requires that you have at least one pair with an angle that opposes a known side. However, you can calculate the third angle of this triangle using simple subtraction. All three angles add up to 180 degrees, so you can find angle γ{\displaystyle \gamma } by subtracting:   γ=180−α−β=180−30−50=100{\displaystyle \gamma =180-\alpha -\beta =180-30-50=100}    Now that you know all three angles, you can use the sine rule to find the two remaining sides. Solve them one at a time:   Csin⁡γ=Bsin⁡β{\displaystyle {\frac {C}{\sin \gamma }}={\frac {B}{\sin \beta }}}   10sin⁡100=Bsin⁡50{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{\sin 100}}={\frac {B}{\sin 50}}}   10sin⁡50sin⁡100=B{\displaystyle {\frac {10\sin 50}{\sin 100}}=B}   10∗0.7660.985=B{\displaystyle {\frac {10*0.766}{0.985}}=B}   7.78=B{\displaystyle 7.78=B}    Thus, side B is 7.78 inches long. Now solve for the final remaining side.   Csin⁡γ=Asin⁡α{\displaystyle {\frac {C}{\sin \gamma }}={\frac {A}{\sin \alpha }}}   10sin⁡100=Asin⁡30{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{\sin 100}}={\frac {A}{\sin 30}}}   10sin⁡30sin⁡100=A{\displaystyle {\frac {10\sin 30}{\sin 100}}=A}   10∗0.50.985=A{\displaystyle {\frac {10*0.5}{0.985}}=A}   5.08=A{\displaystyle 5.08=A}    Side A, therefore, is 5.08 inches long. You now have all three angles, 30, 50 and 100 degrees, and all three sides, 5.08, 7.78, and 10 inches.   

mark the sides.  mark the angles.  label any measurements that you know.  understand the sine rule.  review the data you need.  write the portion of the law of sines that you need.  fill in the numbers that you know.  rearrange to solve for the unknown information.  solve for an unknown angle.  use the inverse function if needed to find the angle.  solve a problem with incomplete information. 

 Start with simple objects (like the classic bowl of fruit) or common objects and progress to more complicated subjects — an intricately shaped table, for instance, or people's faces. The better you get at drawing real-life objects, the better you'll eventually be at putting ideas on paper.   For example, let's say you get an idea for a comic book character. You can imagine every detail — the expression on their face, the emotion in their eyes, the pose that represents who this character is — but if you haven't been practicing with faces, eyes, and poses, you'll have a hard time drawing this character on paper in a way that matches with the image you have in your head. Instead of going big or elaborate in the beginning, focus on the small and simple. Take a bowl of fruit, or a house, or a mountain range, and practice replicating these objects with just a pencil. Draw different versions of the same thing. If you're drawing a mountain range, for example, do a little evaluation of your first drawing. Figure out what's right and what's wrong, or have a friend tell you which parts of the mountain look unnatural or need improvement. Once you have a list of the things you can improve on, draw the mountain range again. This time, improve on the parts you didn't draw well the first time. If you want after a few weeks and your drawing skills improve, draw the same picture again. See how much you've improved! Think of yourself as a chef. When a chef learns a new recipe, he often spends days or weeks only cooking that recipe. It makes for pretty boring eating, but he's able to perfect his dish by the end of the week. Don't get discouraged when your dish doesn't come out perfectly right away. It takes a while to get things right.; , The more you practice, the better you'll get. Even when you're concentrating on something else but your hands are free (being on the phone is the perfect opportunity to doodle) take a piece of paper and a pencil and start drawing basic shapes.   Practice with basic, elemental shapes in the beginning. These basic shapes will form the basis of many harder shapes as you continue drawing. Mastering them will make your journey going forward more meaningful and productive. Draw circles, squares, triangles, rectangles, etc. Challenge yourself progressively by making these shapes as perfect as possible. Then challenge yourself some more by drawing variations of a shape: different sizes of circles and squares, different kinds of rectangles and triangles. With enough repetition (and crumpled sheets in the recycling bin), you should reach a point where you could comfortably draw most shapes. To heighten this basic skill, draw curves and curls as well. Try doing springs and spirals and various loops, curlicues and garlands, paying attention to the consistency of your curves.  If you're drawing a tree, don't draw one leaf at time. Otherwise, it's easy to get caught up in drawing one section of the object and forget about the "big picture" so that you end up running out of room, or, more often, your drawing ends up looking unattractively imbalanced.   Use light, repeated strokes. Keep things loose, and don't worry about mistakes. You're trying to get the general idea right, not a perfect facsimile. Compare, adjust, and improve what you ultimately have. If you're drawing a real object, cross check what you have on paper with the original object. Make sure that the sizes of the shapes relative to each other are as accurate as possible. Imagine what you want the tree to look like ultimately, and make a light sketch with a pencil. You can draw an outline of your intended drawing, or you can draw its "skeleton" (as is often done with drawing bodies). A great method is to imagine the basic shapes the object is made of. In other words, break the object apart in your mind. A tree, in most cases, is an oval or triangle centered on top of a cylinder. Draw both shapes in 3D so that you can fill in the details later, while maintaining the proportions you want.  Use heavier/darker line to bring out the parts of the drawing you need, and use an eraser to take out the lines you don't need. Add details, bit by bit, making sure to frequently step back and look at your drawing as a whole to make sure it's coming along the way you want it to. Learn and experiment with several techniques, which can enhance your ability to express ideas through drawing.   Draw with shading. Shading means the differences in light and color. Think about the way the light hits an object and which parts of the object are light or dark as a result. This can add luminosity, intensity, and depth to a drawing. Picture a bowling ball in the foreground and the sun, right as it's beginning to set, in the background. Since the sun is close to the horizon, the light is going to be hitting the bowling ball from a very low angle, as opposed to high angle (where the sun would be at around noon on a sunny day). This means that in order to capture the light hitting the bowling ball, you're going to need to shade the top of the bowling ball lighter than the bottom, because the sun won't hit the bottom directly. Practice with the shadows. If you want to get very realistic drawings, study the way that light reflects from objects, including the shadows that it leaves. Shadows can be almost mirror images of the object, or they can be stretched out, diagonal, and distorted. Pay attention to the type of shadows that the sun makes in real life, and try to duplicate that in your drawings.  Even if you ultimately want to draw cartoons or caricatures, you'll need to know what makes an object appear realistic in your drawings. If you want your drawings to appear more life-like, then mastering these practices is key.   Familiarize yourself with perspective. Perspective is the idea that things that are further away appear smaller, and things that are closer up appear bigger, very true. If you are drawing a large object (such as a building) or a complicated scene (such as a neighborhood), it's especially important to understand perspective, unless you want your drawing to appear cartoon-like. Focusing on perspective when drawing small, simple objects (a cube, a stack of books) is an excellent exercise in drawing. Get to know proportions. Proportion is the way different parts of an object relate to each other in terms of size. Proportion can affect how realistic the drawing is perceived to be. Use measuring techniques like a grid method or tick marks for accurate proportions. Altering proportions — by exaggerating some aspects and minimizing others — can convey unique ideas, or represent a certain style of drawing. Characters in caricatures and anime, for example, have exaggerated eyes or proportionally large faces. Experiment with getting proportions of objects and people right before you turn them on their head. Play with color. Color adds a different dimension to a piece. Contrast, blending, saturation, and color schemes make some drawings more lively, or more realistic, or abstract, depending on how the color is applied. If you're interested, start mixing watercolors and acrylics. Blend unlikely colors and see which new ones come up. Photocopy some of your drawings, play with different colors, and see how the end result changes depending on which colors you use.  For the beginner, sketch paper will probably work best; very smooth paper will give you better detail, but "toothier" paper holds the graphite from your pencil better.   Pencils come in a scale of hardness, from "hard" pencils, like H, to "soft," like 9B. Hard pencils are low in tones, which means the ability to go from light to dark. Soft pencils, on the other hand, have lots of tones, meaning the pressure you put on the pencil affects the lightness of the line. Try sketching with a 6B or an 8B, a relatively soft pencil, so that pressing down the pencil harder will create darker tones. Once you're ready, try drawing with charcoal. Charcoal comes in a compressed stick or in pencil form. Harder charcoal produces a gray tint, while softer charcoal smudges easier. Use charcoal in the same way that you'd use a pencil. Charcoal, however, can be more expressive than pencil. Use it to capture sweeping gestures and motions, or use it to create deep shading. If you plan on painting a canvas, charcoal can serve as a great outline before you put paint to canvas.  Make a place where you can put all of your drawings, or keep it all together in an art journal. Doing this will help you review your progress. The more you get used to drawing, the more you'll be able to see what your flaws are and determine how to correct them. Also, as you continue drawing, you'll develop your own personal style. It's always interesting to look back and see how your ability to express yourself has grown. Don't let yourself down. When you practice you can make it perfect.  If you find yourself struggling with proportion, annoyed that your poses are stiff and worst of all making and mistakes that your conscious mind knows better not to do, this is a great way to break that cycle. Get a kitchen timer. Set it for five minutes. Choose a subject that's not going to move like a silk rose, something a little challenging that you're fond enough of it to draw it more than once. It helps if you really like the subject. Using a soft (B grade or 2B or 4B, any of the B pencils) pencil, try to sketch it within five minutes or two minutes. Set a specific time period no longer than five minutes. When the buzzer goes off, stop even if it's not finished. Try again on a fresh part of the page.   Each time you try to draw something within five minutes, you'll observe something different about it and concentrate. You'll be correcting mistakes without bothering to go back and erase them. This method is especially good for drawing people since it's not hard to get a friend to pose for a two minute "gesture sketch" as opposed to making them sit still for an hour. Once you have done gesture sketches of a subject, giving yourself a longer time like fifteen minutes will feel like you have forever to get it right. You'll probably finish before the time is up. This is very good practice for being able to draw outdoors when the light can change in half an hour. Try drawing your cat or dog while it's sleeping in short gesture drawings. Two minutes is about as long as a sleeping animal holds still before it rolls over or moves in its sleep. Try drawing something simple like a pencil. Things that are common and easy to draw. Practice the object you chose a few times until it looks right. Then, once you think it looks right, go on to a harder thing such as a human face.  

draw what you see.  draw as often as you can.  make a rough sketch.  elaborate on your sketch.  add touches of realism.  what you need to start out.  keep your work.  try a timed gesture drawing. 

 Stand on the scale. Register your weight. Write it down. Ideally, use a scale that can measure in tenths of a pound. This method is less precise than a baby scale but is cost effective.   1/10 of a pound is 45.36 grams or 1.6 oz  , Preferably hold your child while she is naked. This will ensure a more accurate reading. If you prefer, you can hold your child’s clothes while you weigh yourself so that only the child’s body weight is added when you weigh yourself with a dressed child.  Register the weight. Write it down. Subtract your single weight from your combined weight. The result is your baby’s weight.   For example: if you alone weigh 140 lbs. and you and the baby weight 149.8 lbs., then your baby weighs 9.8 lbs. on his own.  

weigh yourself.  pick up your child.  weigh yourself and your baby.

 Look for images of the supermodel online, to help you copy her or his features. You also have the opportunity to print out any full length photo that you think could be used as the doll in its own right.   If cutting out an image of the whole supermodel, try to find one in bikini/beach wear/shorts, so that there aren't clothes in the way. If that's not possible, it's okay, just not as ideal. Even if you're drawing the supermodel (see next step), it might be fun and easiest to cut out the supermodel's face from a magazine or print it off from online, as this will make it look real.; , Following the prompts from the images you've searched online. Use plain card that is strong but not too thick, to form the basis of the doll. The doll should be drawn bare except for its undergarments.   If you're using a cut-out of a full-length image printed from the internet, cut around the design carefully. Glue this to the card, then cut around the card carefully. Although the doll will be clothed, you can cover this up with the clothes you design. Use plain card; anything with patterns won't look realistic.  You can draw the eyes, mouth, nose, etc. on the paper doll. Or, consider gluing on a printed picture of the supermodel's face and maybe even the hair, to make the doll seem more realistic.   Allow all glue to dry thoroughly before adding clothes, or the clothes might stick and will need to be ripped off.  Be careful around areas such as the hands and feet; do not cut out individual fingers or toes, as this will make the paper doll too fragile and it's not needed anyway.  Place the doll on a sheet of paper and trace around its outline.  Put it to one side.  Place tracing paper over the outline and draw trousers, tops, swimwear, dresses, skirts, shorts, etc.  This paper should be thinner than the card used for the doll but thick enough so that it won't tear with use. Printer paper may be suitable, if of good quality.   Add tabs around the clothes at various points. These tabs will be folded onto the back of the doll to hold the clothes in place.  It's might be easiest to color it in before cutting it out, as the surrounding paper makes it stronger until cut. However, if you're okay with coloring it while cut, that's okay too. When done, cut the clothes out, along with their tabs.  You can update her or his wardrobe whenever you wish. Keep an eye on the latest catwalk fashions for inspiration.  

decide which supermodel you'd like to turn into a paper doll.  draw the supermodel.  design the paper doll's features.  cut out the drawn paper doll.  trace around the paper doll to get the right dimensions for the clothing.  remove the doll.  make the clothes using the template.  transfer the drawings to suitable thick paper.  color in the clothing.  make as many outfits for the supermodel as you like. 

 A good way to show another person that you would like to be friends with them is to say "Hi" when you see them. Make eye contact, smile, and say hello. If you know the person's name, say, "Hi ____."Be sure to speak clearly so the other person can hear you. If you are shy, practice with one of your family members. Always smile and say hi in the hallway when you see the person again. You want to seem as friendly as possible.; , Paying someone a compliment shows that you are a pleasant girl and that you are open to being friends with other people. Pay attention to the other kids at school and try to identify one nice thing about them. You can then give them a compliment about what you have noticed. Keep the compliments simple such as:"Your hair looks really cute." "I like your shirt." "You did a good job on your project." You can also follow up a compliment with a question to get the conversation started. For example, "I like your shirt. Where did you get it?"  , Saying hi or giving a compliment is a good way to start a conversation. When you are speaking with someone, you should share your likes and dislikes. If you are asked a question, answer the question, and then ask the other person a question. Do not be a conversation hog.It is important that you share information about yourself as well. Friendship is a two way street.  Listen when the other person is talking and do not cut them off. Wait until they are finished before you begin to talk.  Doing something nice for someone else is another way you can show someone that you like them. You do not have to do anything big. Let someone borrow a pencil or a piece of paper. Offer to help if someone carry something. Share some candy or another treat at lunch time.Do not give away money or other things that are special to you. You do not want someone to be friends with you just because you give them things.  In order for a friendship to grow, you and the other person should have things in common. Common interests will help your friendship grow. What type of things (e.g. music, TV shows, movies, art, sports, etc.) are you interested in?Observe other kids in your class to see if they have some of your interests. Are they wearing a shirt with a movie character or band on it? Do they use special folders that are linked to their interests? Ask questions to see what they like. For example, "Hey, have you seen ___? It's really good!" or "Do you like ___ ?" Do not pretend to like something just to be friends with someone. If you want to have a best friend, you need to be honest and show who you really are. If you are shy and you notice another girl that keeps to herself, this would be a good person for you to approach. You two can probably understand each other better than the popular girl who is the life of the party. If you are involved in an extracurricular activity, you know you have at least one common interest with that person already.  Once you have found someone that has some similar interests, ask them if they want to come to your house to hang out. You can also suggest an activity the two of you can do together. Spending one-on-one time with a person is the key to establishing a friendship.If the person is coming to your house, think of some activities the two of you can do together. Pick activities that both of you will like. You want the person to have as much fun as possible around you. Some activities you may suggest include riding bikes, painting your nails, watching or going to a movie, or baking cookies. If you can't think of anything, ask your parents to help you come up with some ideas.  

speak to other kids you are around.  give a compliment.  start a conversation.  be kind to your classmates.  look for people that have similar interests.  invite the person to hang out. 

 It is not a good idea to start your painting project on a surface that hasn't been thoroughly cleaned, and kitchen countertops can have years of builder on them, especially the surfaces nearest the stove.   Use an ammonia-based cleaning solution to scrub the laminate and/or ceramic tile countertops free of all dirt, grime, oil and grease. Allow the surface to dry completely.; , Using painter's tape, cover any trim, walls or cabinets that might get dripped on or accidentally painted, and protect your floors with a drop cloth. Expending the effort on this preparation will save you a lot of time and aggravation on touch-ups and cleanups after you refinish the countertops.  Prepare the countertops with a good quality bonding primer that will improve paint adhesion, allowing the primer to dry for at least 24 hours before beginning to paint.   Ask the professionals at your home improvement store for suggestions on the best brands.  Using the color you selected, you can start to paint the countertops now that the bonding primer is completely dry. Avoid applying the paint too thickly and paint 2 or 3 thin coats instead, allowing each coat to dry between applications.   For laminate countertops, use a water-based paint. For tile countertops, use an oil-based paint.  In order to protect your painting project from chipping or scratching, use a water-based, non-yellowing polyurethane finish. Apply 3 coats of polyurethane, each coat drying before you apply the next. After the third coat has dried, wait an additional 24 hours before using your newly painted countertops.  

begin with clean countertops.  cover any areas you don't want painted.  apply a bonding primer.  paint the countertops.  seal the paint.

 Make sure you feel solid over both feet.   If your hips are tilted then your already in an improper boxing stance. If you don't feel solid over both feet then your in an improper stance. Your feet should not be in line with each other. For example your feet should not be one foot  in a direct line with the other foot.; , Avoid having one foot in line with the other foot. Your front toe should be in line or off line with your rear heal. Also have your rear heal raised. Your feet should never cross with each other, since this is unbalanced.  If your feet are too wide you will be locked in that position; if your feet are too close together then you will be off balance and easily knocked over. Your front leg should be stiff and your back leg bent. You can however be to wide for more power or your feet some what close for more speed, in punching. Adjust as needed.  The front foot should be at about 45 degrees, turned inward, and your back foot 45 degrees as well. Put your weak hand in the front and your strong hand in the back. You can adjust the degrees of your feet position for your comfort just a little. Your back foot can be pointed directly to the side, if you're more comfortable this way.  Stand wide with your front toe in line, cutting off your rear heal and widening your triangular stance. With this wide stance your upper body will be a small target. You may adjust this stance to your comfort. In this stance, your front 'shoulder will be pointing to your opponent. This wide stance will take some percentage off your offense power and some percentage off your balance. You will have more percentage towards your defense and take some percentage off your offense. This stance is not wrong. This stance would be more for the jabbing range, long range.  This can be called shorting or making the triangular stance shorter instead of longer. Keep in mind that in this stance you will give up some percentage of your defense by squaring up your shoulders and giving some percentage to your offense. You will be in perfect balance. This stance is perfect for close range fighting, as you need to be in perfect balance at close range hook and uppercut range. This stance will give you also mobility to slip and to have power.  You front shoulder should be in line with your front heal; your front foot should be about 25 degrees inward adjust as need for comfort. Your rear foot should be pointed directly at your opponent. Adjust as need for your comfort. Use this stance at close range. Keep in mind that your front toe and your rear heal should be about six inches apart from each other. This stance will give you good balance at close range. Widen or shorten your feet as needed. Widen for power; shorten for speed.  You need your front leg to be stiff but not completely locked. It's a bit like a pole/hinge of a gate in the ground, so you can turn your hips properly when punching with the rear hand.   If you're punching with the lead hook your rear leg should be stiff but not locked, like a pole in the ground.  Your weight should be 50 percent on one foot and 50 percent on the other foot. Doing this will aid you in moving on your footwork. This will help you move more effectively with your weight evenly distributed adjust as needed.   To move more effectively have your weight on the balls of your feet. If you want your weight to be on the heel of your front foot, keep your front leg stiff with the bones in your leg lined up. If your front leg is bent, you will have your weight across your entire front foot instead of your weight just on your heel, which can feel more balanced.  

start with your hips parallel with the ground.  get in a triangular stance.  keep your feet only shoulder width apart.  position your feet at an angle.  widen your stance to be more defensive.  keep a more square stance to give your offense full potential.  balance both offense and defense with a compromise stance.  adjust as needed in order for your hips to turn properly.  keep your weight balanced.

 If you already have a credit or debit card, go get it. If not, use cash to buy a pre-loaded debit card from a convenience store or pharmacy, or buy a gift card from the theater.   To avoid suspicion, don’t buy the gift card from the theater the same day you try to see the movie.  Purchase your ticket online or at an automated kiosk at the theater.Deal with one less person who may wonder how old you are. Remember that once you’re inside, you'll still have to present your ticket to a staff member who will direct you to the particular theater in which your movie’s playing. Wear clothes and accessories that are appropriate for the age you’re pretending to be.  Once you have your ticket, wait until a few other people approach the staff member who's collecting tickets. The busier it is, the more likely the staff member will wave people through without glancing at anything but the theater number printed on their tickets. If there’s no line, dawdle by the concession stand or pretend to text somebody on your phone until a line builds up.  

use plastic.  avoid human contact.  wait for the line to back up. 

 If you're suffering from morning sickness, sometimes the last thing you feel like doing is eating. However, it is important that your body gets the vitamins and nutrients it needs to keep you and your growing baby healthy.   Try to avoid an empty stomach by eating small, frequent meals throughout the day. You should also try to eat at a slower pace than you normally would to avoid overeating, which may make you feel even worse.; , It's extremely important that you stay hydrated, especially if you're getting sick frequently. If you let yourself become dehydrated, you will feel even more nauseated. Sip fluids throughout the day, using a straw if it helps. Try to refrain from drinking 30 minutes before or after eating, however.   You should try to drink about 6 to 8 glasses of water each day. However, if you've been getting sick a lot, you can try replacing some of the water with a sports drink containing glucose, salt, or potassium to help restore lost electrolytes.Alternatively, you can try drinking cold, carbonated beverages, as some women find these easier on the stomach. Other women also find sour drinks, like lemonade, easier to keep down. Avoid drinking too many fluids, though. Liquids can give you a false sense of fullness which may cause you to feel less hungry throughout the day., Many women insist that crackers are a necessity when dealing with morning sickness. They make a great snack as they are portable, inexpensive and easy to digest. Keep a stash of dry crackers beside your bed and eat a few before getting up in the morning, then continue to nibble on them throughout the day.If you need to get up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, try eating a cracker or two then as well. They'll help stave off hunger and settle your stomach before the morning.It doesn't matter what kind of crackers you eat, saltines, wheat thins, rice cakes - it's a matter of personal preference. If you're not a cracker fan, try eating dry cereal instead. Avoid coating your crackers in greasy butter or fatty spreads, they may make you feel more unwell and are harder to digest. Eat the crackers dry, if possible.  Stick to bland foods as much as possible when dealing with morning sickness. They smell less strongly and are easy to digest.   Do your best to avoid spicy, acidic, and fried foods, as these are more likely to upset your stomach. Try the BRAT diet, which consists of bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. These foods are bland and low in fiber and thus gentle on your digestive track. They are also very inexpensive.You can also add tea and yogurt to the list to go on the BRATTY diet.  After a while, you will start to notice that certain foods or smells will trigger your nausea. It may be pizza, bacon or anything at all. Once you know your triggers, you can take steps to avoid them.Try making a note of when and why you feel queasy every day, in order to identify your food triggers.  Indulge your cravings, especially if it helps you to feel better. If you have a craving for a particular food, your body may be trying to tell you something. If you are craving dairy, perhaps you need calcium. If you are craving peanut butter, perhaps you need protein or more calories., A lot of women find carbohydrate-filled foods the most appealing when feeling nauseated. Stock up your cupboards with carbohydrate-rich pasta, bread, pretzels and granola bars., Some women find that high protein foods help to ease their morning sickness. Whether it's scrambled eggs, peanut butter, or a lean piece of meat, try to find a protein-rich food that works for you., Try to eat your food either cold or at room temperature, because food tends to have a more pervasive smell when heated, and strong aromas can be major triggers for morning sickness.Stick to sandwiches, fruit and raw vegetables, and salad (when it's properly prepared to prevent listeria).  Fatty foods take longer to digest and can be rough on your digestive system, which can worsen feelings of nausea.They are also less healthy, providing fewer nutrients than other types of foods and have a tendency to smell quite strongly, which isn't good. Avoid!  , Brush your teeth thoroughly and swirl some mouthwash after you eat. This will prevent odors and tastes from hanging around your mouth after eating. Get your partner to brush his teeth too, while you're at it. Nothing like a pepperoni pizza breath kiss to trigger your gag reflex.  You should avoid lying down for at least 30 minutes after eating, as the horizontal position can interfere with digestion and lead to queasiness. 

eat small, frequent meals.  drink lots of fluid.  snack on crackers.  stick to bland food.  avoid foods and smells that trigger your nausea.  listen to your cravings.  eat carbohydrates.  eat high-protein foods.  eat cold food.  avoid fatty foods.  brush your teeth.  avoid lying down after eating. 

 When writing an informal letter in German, as in English, you have more freedom in terms of starting your letter. It’s not necessary to write the date or address, though you can if you want. Give your letter an informal salutation that suits who you are writing to. Pay special attention to the spelling. For example, write “Liebe” (“Dear”) if you are writing to a woman, but “Lieber” (“Dear”) if you are writing to a man. Try one of these greetings:Guten Tag, Frau Müller (Good day, Ms. Müller) Liebe Frau Müller (Dear Ms. Müller) Lieber Heinrich (Dear Heinrich) Hallo, Andreas (Hi Andreas) Mein lieber Schatz (My dear honey) Hallo mein Liebling (Hello my darling) Hallo meine Süße (Hello sweetie - female) Hallo mein Süßer (Hello sweetie - male)  , Since you are writing an informal letter, you have plenty of freedom for choosing what to say and how to structure it. In general, try to keep your ideas grouped together, and separate paragraphs with line breaks to make your letter easy to read.   Remember that you do not need to capitalize the first word of the body of your letter.  Even for letters to friends or family, it’s courteous to include an clear closing in your letter. You can be more casual or even intimate, depending on who you are writing to. Try one of these common closings:Herzlichst (Cordially) Viele Grüße (Lots of regards) Liebe Grüße (Lots of love) Alles Liebe (Lots of love) Dein (Yours - male) Deine (Yours - female) In Liebe (With love - for romantic relationships)  

select an informal greeting.  write the body of your letter.  close your letter informally.

 This should be pronounced in the first tone, a longer sustained, level pitch. This means "central"; , This word may be longer than the first character because it is pronounced with a second (rising) tone. Make sure that "goo" and the "oh" maintain continuity and are not pronounced as separate words. This means "country, nation"  ,

 Take a look at the picture and get an idea of what size mat and/or frame you'll need. The completed project will consist of your picture sandwiched between two uniformly sized mats, with the center of the frontal mat cut to display the picture. You'll need at least two pieces of mat board: one to serve as the backing for the picture and the other to cut a "window frame" that wraps around the front side of the picture. Larger pictures, like artwork headed for exhibition, will obviously require larger mats, but the exact specifications of the mat will also depend on how much of it you want to be visible around the picture.; , Mats come in many different colors, designs and thicknesses. Pick a mat (or a number of mats if you choose to utilize multiple layers) you like that is a good look for the picture you'll be framing, then decide whether the mat will go around the edges of the picture in the frame or serve as a frame itself. If you think the picture you're framing might benefit from the added depth of multiple layered window frame mats, select the mats in color and texture combinations that complement each other.Mat board comes in many different thicknesses. The thicker the mat you choose for cutting, the wider and deeper the "white line" created by the mat's inner material will be around the edges of the finished piece. Consequently, thicker mat types might look better in plain white to hide the cut inner edges. Mat board is also available in two general quality ranges. Standard mat board is fine for photographs and prints that aren't meant to be professionally displayed, while archival mat board is exhibition quality and therefore costs more. Archival mat board should be used with original artwork, especially when they're done on archival materials with artist-grade art supplies.  To cut the mat, you'll need a sharp blade capable of cutting perfectly straight lines. The most readily available and least expensive option is a standard razor blade or box cutter with a fixed handle. You can also purchase a specialty sliding mat cutter tool, but these tend to be more costly and require more of a learning curve to use without making mistakes.   Razor blades, X-Acto knives and box cutters all make use of extremely sharp exposed blades. Be very cautious when handling these tools. Mat cutting kits can be purchased at most art stores and make it easier to measure, align and cut mats in a single station, but will run you considerably more money., The ruled edge will be used to measure the mat to fit the picture and frame and to assist in cutting straight edges. The T-square has the added benefit of enabling you to measure precise angles. You'll also need the ruler or T-square to keep the width of all sides of the mat consistent.   Heavy metal rulers will work better, as they provide some weight to hold the mat steady beneath them and you won't have to worry about damaging them with your cutting tool.  Use the ruler to measure the height and width of the picture you'll be cutting the mat to fit. Both of the mats you cut should match the dimension of the picture exactly; the inner area of the second (window frame) mat will need to be cut at least a half inch smaller than the picture itself to hold it in place. Write down the picture's dimensions and set it aside for now.During this step you can decide how wide you want to cut your window mat to go on top of the picture. If only a portion of the picture needs to be visible, a wider mat will fill in the non-focal area around the edges and let you center the picture exactly where you want it.  If you have a frame picked out that you want to use, remove the glass or plastic from the front and extract the backing board. The backing board is what you will be using for reference as the mats will be measured and cut to fit the inner part of the frame where the picture sits. Copy down the dimensions of the frame, making sure to differentiate what the various measurements are for.Most frames you buy will already have their specifications listed. Disregard this measurement and take your own. Since it's imperative that the mat you cut be able to fit the frame, it's better not to take chances with sizing.  With the dimensions of the picture or artwork in mind, decide what size will work best for cutting the window mat. The window mat will be placed around the edges of the front side of the picture and will usually overlap the picture slightly, so settle on a window mat size that doesn't obscure too much of the picture. On the back of the second mat board, trace the measurements of the picture where you plan to cut the window frame.For most small-to-medium sized pictures, a window mat with a width of around .5"—1.5" will provide a nice frame for the picture without covering too much of it.  Refer back to the dimensions of the frame backing board you measured earlier. Using these measurements, place the ruler or T-square along the first edge of the mat and mark with a pencil on the back side of the mat where the cutting edge is to be. Start at the top edge of the mat and make a small notch every few inches. This will give you a dotted line to follow as you cut, and can help you realign the cutting trajectory if the ruler is to slip at any point.   Always mark and cut from the back side of the mat. That way, none of your marks or cutting imperfections will be visible on the finished mat surface.  Take the razor, box cutter or mat cutter tool and line it up with the edge of the ruler. Make sure the cutting edge is flush with the ruler; if you're using a mat cutter tool, it will be a sliding attachment with its own ruled edge to ensure that the cutter doesn't slip. When cutting manually, be sure to press firmly against the ruler or T-square to keep it from moving as you cut. Cut the mat with a slow, steady motion, applying equal pressure throughout the whole movement. Repeat the cutting process on the remaining three sides of the mat, checking again that the length and width are accurate and that you're cutting the right amount.Bear down hard when cutting the mat. It's best to go all the way through on the first pass to keep the cut clean and straight, but if that's not possible then make several lighter passes, watching for crooked cuts. To continue a cut that is only partially complete, push down vertically with your blade until you go all the way through, adjust the angle of the blade, and resume cutting.  Remember: safety first. Severe injury can result from improper use of cutting tools. Cut slowly and keep all appendages out of the path of the blade.  Cut the second mat board to the exact specifications of the first. You'll be using this mat as the window frame for the front of the picture. If you've selected a mat of a fanciful color or design, it should be the one you use for the window mat, as it will be front and center in the frame and complement the aesthetic of the picture. Once again, let the ruler edge guide you as you carefully cut out the four sides of the window frame.   The outer dimensions of the window frame should be the same of the backing mat, as they will be fitted together. The inner dimensions are a matter of preference, but generally a .5"—1.5" window frame looks best.  If you want to create a more complex layered look, cut multiple window frame mats, each approximately .5" to 1" smaller than the previous one. Arrange the mats concentrically around the picture. When using layered mats, you can alternate various colors or designs, making the space around the picture deeper and more ornate.When layering mats, be sure that you're measuring and cutting each mat separately, and unless it's part of the design, keep the size variations between the mats consistent.  Place the picture against the backing mat and then center the window frame mat over it. Once you've lined up both mats and made sure the picture is centered, take small strips of artist's tape and lightly stick the mat halves together. Flip the matted picture over and tape across the back edges. You can then remove the strips of tape from the front and the mats will be secured around the picture. That's it! Insert the newly-matted picture into the frame or let the mats act as a rough frame themselves if you prefer.Stick the tape to a piece of fabric before applying it to the mat. If the tape is too tacky, you might tear the mat or picture when removing it. It's recommended that you find an actual covered frame for original artwork once it's been matted. Otherwise, you risk damaging or smudging the art if it's left exposed.  

have the picture you want to frame ready.  decide on a style of mat that you like.  choose a cutting implement.  acquire a ruler or t-square.  measure the picture you want to frame.  measure the frame.  choose a size for the window mat.  mark the first mat where it is to be cut.  cut the first (backing) mat.  cut the second (window frame) mat.  create layered mats.  secure the mats. 

 Vitamin C also lowers the risk of various chronic diseases including angina pain and coronary heart disease. Although vitamin C deficiency is rare, it can greatly affect the immune system. Vitamin C can be taken as a dietary supplement with a recommended dose of 500 mg split into two or three times daily. You can also add vitamin C-rich foods to your daily diet. Good natural sources of vitamin C are:  Sweet red or green peppers Citrus fruit such as oranges, pomelo, grapefruit, limes or non-concentrated citrus juices Spinach, broccoli and Brussel sprouts Strawberries and raspberries Tomatoes Mango, papaya and cantaloupe   Since smoking depletes vitamin C, smokers may need an additional 35 mg per day.  Niacin is a form of vitamin B3 used to improve blood flow and lower bad cholesterol levels. High cholesterol causes plaque to build up in your arteries. Lowering your cholesterol reduces the risk for angina and heart disease. Niacin may also help regulate blood sugar levels for type 1 and type 2 diabetes., The recommended dosage for niacin are 14 to 18 mg per day, whether taken as a supplement or through a food source. Do not take a higher dosage unless recommended by your doctor. People with coronary artery disease, severe or unstable angina should not take niacin without their doctor’s supervision. Large doses can raise the risk of heart rhythm problems. The best food sources of vitamin B3 are found in beets, brewer's yeast, beef liver, beef kidney, fish, salmon, swordfish, tuna, sunflower seeds, and peanuts. Bread and cereals are usually fortified with niacin. In addition, foods that contain tryptophan, an amino acid the body converts into niacin, include poultry, red meat, eggs, and dairy products. Niacin is available as a tablet or capsule in both regular and timed-release forms. The timed-release tablets and capsules may have fewer side effects than regular niacin. However, the timed-release versions are more likely to cause liver damage. Doctors recommend periodic liver function tests when using high doses (above 100 mg per day) of niacin.  Magnesium is a necessary nutrient for many body functions, contributes to energy production. It regulates anxiety, stress, chronic fatigue, and helps maintain healthy blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels to reduce the risk of angina and other heart diseases. Magnesium deficiency can also weaken the immune system and cause a number of health problems.Natural food sources of magnesium are salmon, mackerel, halibut, tuna, dark chocolate, dark leafy greens, nuts, seeds, brown rice, lentils, soybeans, black beans, chickpeas, avocado, and bananas. Calcium can inhibit the absorption of magnesium supplements, so it is better to use more readily absorbed forms such as magnesium bicarbonate and magnesium oxide. 100 mg of magnesium supplements is recommended to be taken two to three times daily. Adults should get at least 280–350 mg of magnesium daily. Symptoms of magnesium deficiency may include agitation and anxiety, restless leg syndrome (RLS), sleep disorders, irritability, nausea and vomiting, abnormal heart rhythms, low blood pressure, confusion, muscle spasm and weakness, hyperventilation, insomnia, and even seizures. Excessive intake of magnesium can have adverse effects and reduce calcium absorption, so it is important not to overdose. Ask your doctor what dosage will be right for your individual needs.  Resveratrol is an active compound found in grapes, grape seed and berries. It is shown to have beneficial effects on cardiovascular health by reducing high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes and plaque formation in arteries, thereby managing and preventing angina pain. Resveratrol is available as a liquid extract, capsules or tablets at most pharmacies and nutrition stores. The recommended dosage for resveratrol is 30 to 45 mg after meals, up to three times per day.  

get more vitamin c. vitamin c is an important natural antioxidant that helps promote immune function, manage blood sugar, and stimulate cell growth and repair.  increase your intake of niacin.  get enough magnesium.  take resveratrol. 

 Though not ideal, some airlines may not allow animals in the cabin and if your cat is healthy, they can cope with air travel in the cargo hold. Most U.S. airlines are required to report all companion animal incidents that occur in the cargo hold.Look at the performance record of the airline you are planning to fly with. If possible, choose an airline with a low number of companion animal incidents in the cargo hold.   Animals flown in the cargo area of airplanes are killed, injured, or lost on commercial flights each year. Excessively hot or cold temperatures in the cargo area, as well as poor ventilation and rough handling are often to blame for these incidents.However, many cargo holds are now pressurized and have a certain level of climate control. Talk to the airline about any safety features in the cargo hold that will make your cat's travel more comfortable.  This will cut down on the amount of security checks you and your cat will have to go through. It will also lower the delay time of getting your pet off the plane, especially if your pet is traveling in the cargo hold.Always travel on the same flight as your pet. You can confirm this by asking the airline if you can watch your pet being loaded into the cargo hold before getting on the flight. Look for early morning or late evening flights if you are traveling in the summer as this will be the cooler times of the day and make the cargo hold less hot and stuffy for your cat. Choose afternoon flights if you are traveling in the winter, as it will be less chilly in the cargo hold for your cat.  Look for a collar that can’t get caught in the carrier doors. Put your name, home address, telephone name, and final destination on the collar.You should also put a travel label on the carrier with the same information in the event the carrier, and your cat, get lost during travel.  This will protect your cat’s nails from getting hooked in the carrier’s doors, holes, and other crevices in the cargo area., You will need to ask your vet for vaccination records for your cat and a health certificate for travel. These documents are required by the airline to allow your cat to fly.Your vet should give you a health certificate that confirms your cat is in good health and free of parasites. All your cat’s vaccinations should also be up to date, including his Rabies vaccination.Your vet may also suggest implanting a microchip into your cat that will make it easier to locate him if he goes missing during travel. It acts as your pet's ID for life. Microchipping your pet is a simple procedure, where your vet injects a microchip the size of a grain of rice (12mm) under the surface of your pet's skin, between his shoulder blades. It does not hurt your pet and no anesthetic is required., Traveling on an empty stomach will cut down on any nausea or vomiting. You can give your cat small amounts of water, or place ice cubes in the water dish in the carrier to keep your cat hydrated., If your cat is lost or misplaced during the flight or landing, the photograph will help airport security identify him., Your cat’s travel carrier must go through the luggage x-ray screening device at the airport, but your cat cannot. So you will need to attach a harness to your cat with a leash to prevent him from escaping. You should then carry your cat in your arms through the human screening device.Before you take your cat out of the carrier, prepare yourself and your belongings for screening. Remove your shoes, toiletries, and electronics and place them in bins to go through the x-ray machine. Remove your cat from the carrier, keeping him in the harness, and send the carrier through the machine. Carry the cat as you go through the human screening device. Then, find the carrier and safely place your cat inside before gathering your belongings.  Do this as you board the plane. The captain may take special precautions when flying, like avoiding turbulent areas while in the air.  Your vet should give you medication for your cat that is specifically for air travel, such as Buprenorphine, Gabapentin, or Alprazolam.Be sure to give your cat a dose at home before the flight as a “dry run” to make sure your cat does not react negatively to the medication.  If anything seems wrong with your cat, take him to a vet immediately. Get the results of the vet exam in writing, including the date and time, in the event you complain to the airline about the treatment of your cat in the cargo hold. 

ask the airline for their companion animal incidents report.  try to get a direct flight.  attach a collar on your cat with your information.  trim your cat’s nails before the flight.  schedule a vet appointment close to the date of travel.  do not feed your cat 4-6 hours before the trip.  carry a current photograph of your cat.  bring a cat harness for airport security.  notify the captain and at least one flight attendant that you have a pet in the cargo hold.  give your cat a sedative if it is prescribed by your veterinarian.  open the carrier as soon as you get off the plane and examine your cat. 

 It may help you to focus your efforts on a couple of current capital cases in your state. Focusing your work on a couple of specific cases may be more effective than tackling several cases or state laws as a whole. However, you should also stay on top of general issues related to capital punishment. Combining this knowledge can help you become a very informed participant in the action against these cases, which in turn may help alter capital punishment laws.   Find a list of upcoming executions at those executions carried out at http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/execution-list-2016. Look for cases from your state and pick one or two about which to inform yourself and around which you can start to build your action against capital punishment. Since cases tried are a matter of public record, you should be able to access trial proceedings and other information. You might consider contacting lawyers or other advocates who worked on the case, though you should recognize that they may not give you information pursuant to data privacy laws in the United States.; , In the United States, death row inmates are not allowed to have contact visits with other individuals. They may also not be permitted to have non-contact visits. For this reason, the most feasible way to get the perspective of a death row inmate is to write the person, which is allowed by law.Locate a potential inmate using an online service. This search will allow you to filter out things such as age, gender, location, and religion. Consider writing to both men and women to see if there are any differences in their experiences.Be honest about your intentions. For example, “Dear John, I found your profile online and am interested in writing you. I’m against the death penalty and am very interested to hear your thoughts on it as well as your experiences.” Make sure to include that you would like to learn more about the inmate’s life before prison or any wishes and dreams he or she might have.  Many groups will organize rallies when there is an execution scheduled or decision on a capital case being made. Attending a local or even national demonstration may help promote the fight against capital punishment. You can also take part in marches such as the Annual March to Abolish the Death Penalty.See what rallies or demonstrations are being held on the websites or social media accounts of organizations or individuals taking action against capital punishment. Many have information on local and national demonstrations and how you can participate. Ask a fellow advocate if there are any events that you can attend. He or she may also be able to tell you if there is anything that you can do in support of the event. Be aware that while it is your right in the United States to protest capital punishment, you must do so peacefully. Using any type of violence can put you at risk of arrest or prosecution., Capital punishment laws are carried out in each state. Because of this, discussing the issue with your local and state legislators or representative can be important to the fight against the death penalty. Talk to the person about his or her position on the matter and present your views. This can help the person get a better grasp on the issues which could set in motion the wheel of change in your state.Locate your local and state representatives by using the service from Common Cause at http://act.commoncause.org/site/PageServer?pagename=sunlight_advocacy_list_page. Schedule a meeting with your legislator. Take notes on specific points you’d like go over during your meeting. This focuses conversation and keeps information at hand should the legislator have questions. Remember to not push your agenda too vociferously by being overly argumentative. Simply getting your point across may be enough to plant a seed in the legislator’s mind about the disadvantages of the death penalty in your state. Volunteer to work in the campaign of an elected official who takes action against capital punishment. Attending the person’s political events may also help bring further attention to your fight against the death penalty. You might even consider protesting officials who support the death penalty.  There are sometimes events scheduled to take action against capital punishment in additional to political demonstrations. Going to lectures, marches, and even fundraisers are another way to help effect change in your state’s laws on capital punishment. In addition, you may even help out someone sentenced to death.Check any websites, email updates, and social media account of individuals or organizations who are actively fighting against the death penalty. Many will post or send information on lectures, fundraisers, and marches you can attend or petitions you can sign.Some events may require that you pay or make a small donation. These often help to defray administrative costs or may be used in a specific action against capital punishment. Consider organizing or hosting an event against capital punishment in your local area. You can do a variety of things such as taking people to scheduled executions to protest, having a fundraiser to donate to a larger organization that fights against the death penalty, or hosting a lecture at a local organization. Advertise your event on social media or in the local news.  Personal or professional commitments may keep you from giving the amount of time you want to taking action against the death penalty. Making a donation to a local representative or group or a national organization can also be a way to take action against capital punishment.Give as much money as you are able to the organization or consider splitting up the money among a couple of groups. Remember that your donation is tax-deductible.  You might be a firm believer in the fight against capital punishment. If this is the case, consider applying for a job with a local or national organization that works to abolish the death penalty. This could make a bigger difference in actions against the death penalty and give the organization needed support and skills.Think about how you could fit within the organization’s structure. Many groups have people who work on the legal, educational, and advocacy parameters of opposing the death penalty. For example, if you like research and are good at it, you could put these skills to use in a law library. Compose a letter of interest detailing your interest and skills and send it along with your resume to the different organizations you’ve identified as potential employers.  Consider volunteering with an organization or legislator that takes action against capital punishment. Offer to work as much as you can to continue the fight to abolish the death penalty. Make sure to let the organization or legislator know about your interest and what specific skills you have that may help in actions against capital punishment.  Another way to take action against capital punishment is to raise public awareness on the issue. Because the Internet targets the global community, you can use it to publish information about issues related to the death penalty. You could start a blog and/ or post stories or pictures about capital punishment on your social media accounts.   Ask another advocate to help you set up your online presence. This person can suggest effective ways at expressing your message.  A position paper is usually 1 to 1 ½ pages long. It details your various positions on the death penalty. Taking some time to consider why you oppose the death penalty can help you more easily put together your position. It will also help you at events or in other forums in which you take action against capital punishment.List your reasons why you opposed capital punishment. This could be for reasons such as you think it’s not adjudicated fairly across socio-economic divides, that it is “cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the 14th Amendment, that it’s not right to take another human life, or that it’s not a deterrent to violence.Consult sources such as encyclopedias, academic journals, government reports, association and institute reports, or newspapers and magazines., Most position papers are very short and consist of two parts: the introduction and the counter argument. Both parts allow you to express your views on why the death penalty should be abolished. The first part usually has three short sections including an introduction to the topic, background to explain its importance, and your specific position on capital punishment.Remember that your introduction has two purposes: to inform your reader about the topic as well as arouse his or her interest in it. Use a “hook” such as a case study to introduce your reader to the topic. For example, “On January 5, 1978, the state of Texas executed Bill Nimitz. Until his death, he maintained his innocence in the brutal murder of a local girl. Thirty years later, forensic evidence proved that he was innocent.” Provide background on the death penalty in the United States and your state so that your reader understands why this topic is important. Your local library or an Internet search may be able to point you to texts or articles about the history of each. Use a separate paragraph to assert your views on capital punishment. Focus the paragraph on the two most important issues to you so that you can explain these in a more comprehensive manner. Having too many of your viewpoints can dilute your arguments opposing capital punishment.  Just as it’s important to discuss your viewpoints, it’s also important to address counter arguments. Refuting counter claims can help you bolster your own position. It can also come in handy if you are at an event and faced with someone who opposes your views.Figure out counterarguments by asking yourself what someone opposed to your position might say. You can then think about how you would respond to that person’s claims. Provide a summary of any counterclaims as well as supporting information for them. This shows that you’ve considered other positions and their validity. Refute the counterclaims based on your own position. Make sure you use not only your informed opinion, but also factual evidence to oppose counterclaims.  Finish off your position paper with a short conclusion. You should restate your arguments against the death penalty and provide a plan of action without introducing new information.Use different words to restate your position than you did in the introduction. After this, discuss the implications of your position and how best to take action. Remember to keep your conclusion as brief and simple as possible.  Once you’ve constructed your position paper, let it sit for a day or two. Then pick it up and review it for mistakes and to be sure your arguments are consistent throughout the paper.Look for any typos or grammatical issues. Reading your paper out loud can help you locate any issues. It can also make sure the text flows logically. Ask a friend or another advocate opposing the death penalty to read your position. These people can also help point out potential problem areas in your paper.  Capital punishment is a fairly complicated issue—legally and, for some people, morally. Your efforts to take action against capital punishment in your state are very admirable. However, if you are new to the fight and are unsure about how to advocating against capital punishment, it’s important to get a sense of what is at stake so that you can be a convincing advocate.Having the wrong information about capital punishment before you begin your fight could have serious consequences such as offending others or impeding your efforts to take action in the future.  Although the federal government broadly allows for the death penalty, each of the 50 states has its own law. As a result, your state would need to repeal its law, not the federal government. However, it’s a good idea to get a sense of the federal and state legal landscapes as they relate to capital punishment.Realize that the federal government lists 41 capital offenses punishable by death. Most of these are related to murder, but are not limited to this.However, Article III of the US Constitution states that a crime committed within a certain state must be tried in that state. This puts the legal impetus on the state.Keep in mind that each state within the US may hold its own trials pursuant to its laws. Currently, 31 states authorize capital punishment.In general, states in the South have a higher rate of handing out capital sentences and executing them.You can find individual statistics and information on the death penalty in your state at http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/state_by_state. It may also be useful to have a general ideas of other states’ laws, which may help you in your own efforts to take action against the death penalty.  Capital punishment touches on a wide and complex variety of issues. This includes things such as the constitutionality of capital punishment, civil liberties, states' rights, jury selection, the methods of execution, and the efficacy of capital punishment in deterring future crimes.Staying abreast on issues related to capital punishment can help you better understand them and more effectively take action against the death penalty.   Get news updates from different organizations that fight against the capital punishment. Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Death Penalty Information Center, and Amnesty International have a lot of resources on their respective websites that can keep you informed on specific issues, initiatives, or even upcoming executions you may want to protest.Many organizations also have mailing lists that will send you information or publications on the death penalty. Think about the positions of groups who support the death penalty. This might be counterintuitive, but having information on their viewpoints may help you more effectively counter their efforts—and capital punishment. For example, if you plan to protest an execution, there may be people on site who also vocally support it. Anticipating any potential arguments through research can help you quickly come up with counter-arguments., Many individuals and organizations have taken action against capital punishment for decades. Talking to people, groups, or even officials who are actively taking action against capital punishment can deepen your knowledge of specific issues as well as inform you of ongoing initiatives and rallies or protests in which you can participate.   Locate other advocates by getting in contact with organizations that actively take action against capital punishment. Most organizations have email and phone numbers at which you can contact them for more information. These groups may also have local advocates or chapters with whom you can take action.Use social media to find out if there are any local groups or individuals who want to take action against capital punishment in your state. Keep in mind these people can also add to your knowledge base on the issues.  

focus your action on a specific case or cases.  contact an inmate sentenced to death.  go to a political rally.  meet with your legislators.  take part in an event.  donate to an organization that fights the death penalty.  work for an organization that fights the death penalty.  volunteer your time against capital punishment.  maintain an online presence.  figure out your own views.  construct your introduction based on your views.  add counter-positions or arguments.  conclude your paper.  review your position paper.  be aware of what is at stake.  recognize state and federal laws on capital punishment.  keep informed about a broad range of related issues.  consult with other advocates against capital punishment. 

 One of the more challenging moments of starting a conversation is the opening lines. You can tackle this challenge head on by starting with a friendly smile, making eye contact, and using small talk. Small talk is good at breaking the ice and being friendly while still being casual and calm.Try to use small talk that is direct but also open ended. Rather than say, “Hi, how are you?”, frame the conversation by saying, “Hi, how was your weekend?” or “How was your day?” This gives the guy a chance to tell you about his weekend or his day, leading to more conversation and connection.  Once you have broken the ice with an engaging question, you may then ask follow up questions about something the guy mentions in his response. Focus on maintaining positive body language as you ask him questions as this will indicate to him that you would like to continue the conversation with him.For example, if the guy mentions he struggled with a test that day, you may ask, “What did you have trouble on?” or you may say, “I remember taking that test, and it was difficult. I can study with you next time if you’d like?” Be helpful and open, as he will feed off of your positive energy and respond in kind. You may also ask him thoughtful questions that will help to create an interesting conversation. For example, maybe you both just handed in a difficult assignment and are talking in the hallway. You may ask, “Did you find the assignment difficult?” or you may make a light hearted comment that you can both bond over, such as, “I hope I passed. How do you think you did?”  , During the conversation, you should also be willing to share information about yourself and respond to his questions. Providing detailed answers to his questions will show him you are engaged in the conversation and interested in connecting with him. Though you may be a bit uncomfortable sharing information about yourself, it will help the guy to feel more at ease and indicate to him that you are trying to build a relationship with him.For example, if he asks you “How was your weekend?” avoid answering with “Good” or “Okay”. Instead, you may tell a funny moment that happened over the weekend when you were out with friends or family. Or, you may tell him you spent most of the weekend studying or reading, but you did get a chance to go for a walk or go to the gym. Try to be honest and also focus on details that might add interest to the conversation.  You can also foster good conversation with the guy by being a good listener when he speaks. You can do this by maintaining eye contact with him, nodding your head, and smiling when he speaks. You can also take a moment to process what he is saying in a thoughtful way before you respond to him to show him you are listening.Being a good listener also means asking thoughtful questions and then not interrupting the guy when he speaks. Demonstrating good listening skills will also allow him to show you the same courtesy when you are speaking.  Humor is always a good way to get over any awkwardness, especially if you are talking to a guy for the first time. You can make a joke by commenting on something you did over the weekend in a funny way or by referring to yourself in a self deprecating way. Jokes are a good way to add some levity to the conversation with the guy and connect with humor.For example, maybe you and the guy both just took a difficult test. You may make a joke about wishing you could text a friend for the answers or regretting your Netflix binge instead of studying. This is a funny way to talk about the test and joke around with the guy, making the conversation feel more relaxed and casual.  

start with small talk and be friendly.  ask thoughtful questions.  share information about yourself.  be a good listener.  tell a joke to lighten the mood. 

 There is a lot of variability between vacuums. Before cleaning yours, read the instructions for directions on how to break apart and clean your vacuum., It can be hazardous to apply water to the vacuum when it is plugged in. None of these steps should be executed while the vacuum is plugged into an outlet, even if it is turned off.  You will need to be able to reach around all the insides of the vacuum to clean it up. Remove the canister and take the filter out. Break down any moving parts that can be deconstructed., Open the canister and drop the insides into a garbage bag. Consider performing this outside or in the garage to avoid spreading dust or dirt around your house. You might need to shake the canister to help jostle some of the dirt out of it., Wet a microfiber cloth. Apply a little bit of all-purpose cleaner or vinegar mix to the cloth. Squeeze the cloth to remove all excess moisture., Use the cloth to rub down the outside and the inside of the canister. Wipe down all parts of the vacuum that are accessible, including the cord and the outside of the hose. Do not, however, apply moisture to the plug itself or any other electrified components.  The filter is generally at the top of the canister and is one of the most important parts of the vacuum. Remove it from the canister and run cold water over it. Do not use soap. Let water run through it until no more dirt or grime is coming off., It is particularly important that you not reinsert components of the canister, like the filter, until they have dried. Putting moist objects in a confined space can encourage the growth of bacteria. Leave the vacuum out in the sun, if possible., The beater bar, the bottom part of the vacuum where dirt is sucked in, often accumulates dirt and hair. Use scissors to cut and remove any hair that is stuck in the bristles.This part in the process can be particularly unsanitary. Consider wearing disposable gloves.  Apply rubbing alcohol to a cotton swab. Then rub the cotton swab over the beater bar to disinfect it. Rub the cotton swab over other parts of the vacuum that come into contact with the floor.   These areas are particularly susceptible to picking up dirt and disease because they are constantly coming into contact with dirtiest parts of your house.Try to avoid spreading alcohol on rubber pieces of the vacuum., For most models, you will need to use your hands to spin the beater bar around so that you can disinfect all sides of it. Some models will allow you to detach the beater ball, which will make it easier to reach all sides.Read instructions to see if your beater ball can be removed. It will make the process easier.  Straighten out a wire hanger leaving only a slight curve at the end. Insert it into the hose and use the curved end to scoop out any clumps of dirt that are clogging up the hose. Be careful not to poke at the hose itself; you do not want to poke a hole in it., Wrap a broom or mop handle in dryer sheets. Use duct tape to firmly attach the dryer sheets to the stick. Put the stick inside the hose and maneuver it so that the dryer sheets rub gently against the hose, picking up dust.   Be gentle, so as to not break the hose., Tape paper towels to the end of a broom or mop handle. Wet the paper towels and apply a vinegar solution to them. Rub the inside of the hose with the paper towels to kill germs and reduce odor.For the vinegar solution mix one part vinegar to two parts water.  Again, it is important that moisture does not get trapped in the canister. If you have sanitized the hose, allow it to sit in a warm spot for 24 hours to dry. 

read the vacuum’s instructions.  unplug the vacuum.  take apart the vacuum cleaner.  empty the canister.  wet a cloth.  wipe down the vacuum.  wash the filter.  allow everything to dry in a warm spot for a day.  cut hair out of the beater bar.  disinfect the beater bar.  spin the beater bar and continue disinfecting.  use a wire hanger to remove clogs.  dust the inside of the hose.  sanitize the hose with a vinegar solution.  allow the hose to dry for a day. 

  Remote mounted radar detectors are typically more expensive than the traditional units that are mounted on dashboards. These radar detectors are more difficult to detect if you're in a place where they are illegal as the detector unit is usually mounted inside the dashboard. This unit is also not visible to thieves. Remote mounted radar detectors should always be installed by a professional as the unit will need to be placed inside the dash.; ,  These are the most common of all radar detectors and they can be easily removed from your car. They simply plug into the cigarette lighter of the car and the unit is affixed to the windshield with suction cups. These units are fairly inexpensive and don't require a professional installation.   Both the cordless and corded radar detector require batteries but the difference between them is that cordless models can be plugged directly into the car's fuse box and then any wiring can be hidden by simply tucking it under any molding in the car's interior.  

consider a remote mounted detector.  consider a corded detector.  consider a cordless detector. 

 This is so you won't have to take up as much space. Take out any other junk in your binder.  Separate subjects using tabs. Get the tabs with two sides- use one for your homework and one to put extras/notes in. Keep your planner and paper in it.  Add stickers, song lyrics, and anything else that makes you feel confident and cool!  

take all of your scrap paper out of the binder.  organize.  make it your own. 

; ,, Take the stick out before you intend to use it, to allow it to defrost (at least one hour in advance).  The freezing method will allow your glow-in-the-dark stick to last at least several more turns before it gives up. Instead of lasting for at least 12 -24 hours, it can last at least for a day or more.  

place your glow-in-the-dark stick in the freezer.  leave it there when not in use.  ,  defrost before you wish to use it.  repeat the freeze/thaw cycle until your glow-in-the-dark stick is no longer able to glow. 

 The majority of the fiber breakage will occur on the inside of the fabric, where no one will see., These closures can be extremely hard on soft and colored clothing, so eliminate abrasion and fiber breakage by taking a few extra minutes to fasten up before each load.  While you may already sort by the temperature (cold or hot), you can improve the brightness of your clothes by reducing the amount of off-color dyes the clothes come into contact with.  A bra strap wrapped around a delicate garment will break down fibers faster., Denim and other tough fabrics can cause more wear and tear on fibers. Just as you wouldn’t wash your athletic shoes with lingerie, you shouldn’t wash hard worn items with delicates.  Modern HE washers use a slow, longer tumbling action to wash clothes. Although any contact with the washbasin can be hard on fibers, it is gentler than the traditional agitator washbasin., Purchase a detergent that is intended for HE washers. Fill it to less than the maximum amount, unless there is very heavy soil. , Don’t let the temperature rise above 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 Celsius). Most modern detergent brands are just as effective in cold water., Again, unless there is heavy soil, it will be enough to wash the clothes and prevent fading.   If you have heavy soil in your socks, gym clothes or underwear, purchase an enzyme detergent. Wash these heavy soil items separately at 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 26 degrees Celsius).  If you live in a cold climate, your cold-water wash may run at 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) instead of 60 (16 degrees). Since this temperature is too low to wash your clothes with most detergents, you will need to use a warm setting while the water is colder., Vinegar is said to set colors.  Textile makers use salt to set dye in fabrics, so the clothes are less likely to bleed.Salt is a commonly used ingredient in color safe detergents.  Heat and tumbling in the dryer will contribute to fading. Buy a rack and hang your clothes to dry inside.   Lay wool items out flat on a towel to dry them.  Your clothes will usually smell fresh and retain more color than they would with constant drying cycles.  Overdrying will beat up the clothes and fade them prematurely.  Direct sunlight will start to bleach the fabric almost immediately. The closer you are to the equator, the stronger this effect will be.  

turn all dark and bright clothes inside out before you wash them.  clasp buttons, zip zippers and wash belts separately.  separate black clothing, pastel clothing, bright clothing and white clothing into different loads.  place delicates, belts and lingerie in a pillowcase or laundry sleeve.  place blue jeans in their own washer load.  purchase a high efficiency (he) washer.  use a mild detergent.  wash new bright or dark items separately on the first wash. you want to use a cold setting of approximately 60 degrees fahrenheit (16 degrees celsius) and the minimum level of mild detergent.  ,  choose a cold wash for all colored, bright and dark (separate) loads.  set your washer to the shortest cycle.  adjust your wash routine in cold winters.  pour one-half to one cup (118 to 237 ml) of white vinegar into your wash cycle with your bright loads.  add one-half cup (146 g) table salt to the wash cycle while washing bright colors that are likely to bleed.  hang dry all your colored garments, if you have the space to do so.  line dry in out of direct sunlight during the warmer months.  set the dryer to the lowest amount of time possible.  change into different clothing if you are in bright sunlight all day.

 After you shower, dry your hair with a diffusing hairdryer nozzle. Dry your hair upside down for added volume. Once dry, turn your head upside down. Scrunch and shake your hair up with your hands.   A diffuser attachment for a hair dryer (which looks like a bowl with little spikes pointing up inside) helps create a wavy/curly effect on hair without the frizz. You place your hair in the bowl, the spikes help guide the hair into ringlets, and the holes in the bottom of the "bowl" let the air from the hair dryer.  If you want to go for a messier look, try backcombing. Section your hair and, using a backcombing brush, gently tease the hair backward toward the scalp.  Also sold as beach spray, this gives a much more natural look than gel. Gently spray it onto all of your hair on both sides and on top, then mess up your hair. It will set and is easy to brush out, but will definitely stay put in the wind.  French braid your hair before going to bed or in the morning. Keep it in for as long as possible, then take it out before styling your scrunchy hair.   For even more scrunchy hair, make multiple French plaits in your hair (e.g. one on either side and one at the back). You can also use a pony-tail holder to make a bun on top of your head. Braided buns work even better. If a braid doesn't make your hair as scrunchy as you like, get lots of rubber bands and clip your hair in tiny buns in little sections. Twist your hair and clip until all off your hair is in buns. Leave it overnight and take out the bands.  Rub a small amount of the oil into your hair before scrunching as described in the first section above. Start with the ends, not the roots. Don't massage coconut oil into your scalp.  Some people find that these work better for scrunching than using your fingers alone. Using a cotton garment less 'fluffy' than a towel is thought to reduce frizz.  Use hot curlers or a curling iron to create curls. Once this is done, use a damp hair pick or brush to partially remove the curls. You can leave this as-is or scrunch as described above.   The hair pick is more effective than the brush.  

change your blow-drying techniques.  backcomb.  use a texturizing sea salt spray.  leave plaits in overnight.  substitute coconut oil for gel.  scrunch with a towel or t-shirt.  curl your hair, then brush the curls out partially. 

 It may be hard for you to tell people about how Asperger's Syndrome affects you. However, there are situations where it is necessary for you to tell people that you have Asperger's Syndrome and how it affects you.; , Some people with Asperger's may not be very social, but most are extremely intelligent.  Tell them that it is neither. If they still think of it as such, walk away from them.  After explaining to the person about Asperger's Syndrome ask them if you can hang out with them or just be around them more often.  Remember that you are here for a reason. The people who are insecure or feel uncomfortable about Asperger's are most likely like that about themselves.  

explain to the person what asperger's is and the different ways it can affect people.  explain to the person that asperger's, in some instances, is a part of your own personality and not simply just a behavior disability.  many people make the mistake of associating asperger's syndrome with a sickness or a disease.  most people with asperger's just want a friend.  always feel good about yourself!

 Deciding to do a digital detox can be a big decision. You may worry about what you’ll miss by logging out. You might even wonder what you’ll do with your time. You can do a digital detox if you remind yourself of all the good reasons why you should take this time to log off and unplug.Make a list of three to five things you want to try to get done during your detox time. For instance, you might write that you want to work in your garden, organize your closets, or catch up with old friends. Remind yourself of the benefits of the detox. For example, tell yourself, “I’ll feel more relaxed, in tune with myself, and in tune with my family and friends.” Tell yourself that the detox will give you a break from some of the information-overload you may be feeling.; , Although you may want to start your digital detox right now, you should think about the timing of your detox first. Deciding to log off during a peak work time or around exam time during school may not be best decision. Choose a time when you have fewer responsibilities and when there will be less consequences for missing a message or two.Think about having your detox over a weekend, school break, or holiday. You are less likely to receive important messages during those times. Look at your calendar and pick a time when you don’t have any upcoming deadlines or important events. This way you won’t miss updates about them.  You may not realize all the ways in which you depend on your smartphone and other devices in your day-to-day life. For instance, if you use your phone as an alarm, do you have an alarm clock you can use while you detox? If you want to listen to music during the detox, do you have a radio? If you use your phone or computer for driving directions, do you have maps so you won't get lost? Before your detox, try to note all the different ways in which you rely on your devices and think of other ways to meet your needs.  You may also need to think about how you will do this if your family is not participating in the detox. What will you do if everyone is watching TV? Do you have a digital-free area where you can retreat to read or work on a craft project? How will you fill your time and avoid the temptation when other people are using their devices?  , In general a digital detox will last for about one to two days.This gives you time to connect with your friends and family and do some of the things you’ve been meaning to do. But, if you have a lot of obligations, this might be too long for you. Deciding how long to detox will help you plan for it and anticipate any issues that may come up during your detox time.   Consider your responsibilities and obligations. How long can you digitally detox without getting behind in your work? Think about people that depend on you. Ask yourself if there is anything you would need to do online for them during this time.  If you are including work or school in your digital detox, you may need to let others know what you are doing.This way they can let you know what’s going on and you won’t miss messages about major deadlines or other important information.   Do you have a landline so that someone can call and reach you in case of an emergency? You might also want to let family members know that it's okay to show up unannounced if there is an emergency. Ask someone to contact you with important messages if your digital detox is going to last more than 12 hours. For instance, say something like, “Could you call me on my landline if we have a schedule update at work?” If you primarily communicate with people via text, email, or messaging, you may want to let them know what’s going on.  Nothing can ruin a digital detox or any peaceful time like an electronic device that’s beeping, binging, and chirping every two minutes. Staying logged in will make it easy for you to quickly turn on your device, especially if you have widgets, and check your social networking updates. Logging out and turning off all notifications for social media can help you stick with your detox.   You don’t need to disable your account, but you can log out of the app on your device. You can log back in once your digital detox is over. Make sure you know your login information before you log out of the app. Turn off your alerts and notifications if you can’t or don’t want to log out of your apps.  When your device is right by your side you may be tempted to check it to make sure you aren’t missing anything. Keeping your phone, tablet, or laptop at a distance will make it easier for you to do a digital detox.Remember the adage “out of sight, out of mind.” Put your device in a closet, drawer, or somewhere out of sight. If you need to, ask a family member or close friend to keep your device for you during your digital detox.  One great way to make the most of your digital detox is to spend some of your time doing something to help someone else. It doesn’t have to be a big thing like repainting their house, but you can take an hour or two to do something that benefits someone else.   Volunteer for a cause or organization that you support or attend a charitable event in your neighborhood. Offer to go grocery shopping for your dad, walk your neighbor’s dog, or help your friend wash her car.  During a digital detox is a great time to practice relaxation techniques and calming strategies.When your detox is over, these strategies will help you release stress and tension when you begin to feel digital overload or stress in general.   Try spending just five to 10 minutes meditating. Get comfortable and try to focus on your breathing. If you find your thoughts drifting, gently bring them back to your breathing. Practice deep breathing techniques. Slowly inhale into your belly, hold it, and then slowly exhale. Repeat these steps for a few breaths.  One of the challenges of doing a digital detox is boredom. You may be so used to being online that you don’t know what to do with your time. You can use your time during your digital detox to try a new activity or learn a new skill.Read a book or article about a topic that interests you. You can even go to the library to look at a hard copy instead of a digital one. Take a class or lesson to learn a new skill or talent. For instance, take a gymnastics class or sign up for foreign language lessons.  It can be easy to let social networking and messaging take the place of face-to-face or even phone interaction. You can make the most of your digital detox by spending at least some of your time with your family and friends.You can use this time to catch up, talk, or just hang out.   Give them your undivided attention when you’re together. You don’t have your electronic device distracting you, so look them in the eyes and show them you’re listening. Invite them somewhere or accept their invitations to go out. Catch a movie, grab some coffee, or play some basketball.  Ease yourself back into the digital world. This way you won’t become overwhelmed by the information and entertainment. It will also give you the opportunity to think about which social networks, apps, and games and actually want and need to use.Start by logging back into your primary email account. Prioritize your messages and respond to those you need to. Delete any messages that aren’t important and take a few minutes to unsubscribe to any newsletters or updates you don’t really need.  After your detox, try setting limits for your digital time. This way you can avoid getting caught up in the never-ending cycle of emails, alerts, updates, and posts.Try checking and responding to emails only in the morning (between the hours of 9 and 10am, for instance) and at the end of the day (from 4:30 to 5pm). Turn your notifications off on social media apps and sites. This way you won’t be tempted to check every time your electronic device beeps. Limit the time you spend on social networking sites. For example, you might set a limit of 15 minutes for being on Twitter or Snapchat.  You will get the most benefit out of your digital detox if you make it something that you do more than once.You don’t have to do a full detox for a day or more, though. Doing a mini detox, even for just an hour or two, might help you briefly recharge and relax.   Consider the hour before bed as a non-digital time. Put your electronic devices on vibrate and turn any non-essential alerts off. Have a regular weekend detox for a few hours. For example, you might want to spend every Sunday morning free of your electronics.  

motivate yourself.  choose when to detox.  think through the logistics.  decide how long to detox.  give advance notice.  log out of social networks.  put your electronic devices out of reach.  help someone.  meditate and relax.  learn something new.  socialize with loved ones.  log in one app at a time.  limit yourself.  do a mini detox. 

 Look for respiratory issues like wheezing, sneezing, and breathing through the mouth. Check for nasal discharge, plugged nostrils, swollen eyes, discharge from the eyes, bad breath, white patches in the mouth, or a slimy appearance to the mouth. Affected birds might also be depressed and/or lethargic and lose weight suddenly., Look for curvature in your bird's spine or legs. Check for limping or favoring of a wing, which could signal a broken bone. Watch for bending of your bird's beak as they eat. Other symptoms include seizures, tremors, depression, trouble swallowing, weakened vocalizations, lack of balance, and involuntary eye movements., African Greys aren't as prone to obesity as other parrot species, but that doesn't mean they're immune. Look for abnormal body girth and difficulty breathing. Check for evidence of dermatitis on their feet. Be alert to any evidence of joint pain, which could signal arthritis., Fortunately, this condition is rare in parrots, but it never hurts to know what to look for. Check for sudden weight loss, loss of appetite, vomiting, a bloated abdomen, and difficulty breathing. Look for yellow or green crystals in your bird's urine. These symptoms signal problems with the heart, liver, and/or spleen.

 Men and women tend to wear different types of shorts when playing volleyball. Women’s shorts are tighter and shorter while men’s shorts are longer and looser.   Women typically wear spandex shorts. These have a four-inch inseam and resemble biking shorts.Men wear baggy shorts that reach just above the knee. These resemble basketball shorts.  Jerseys are standard in competitive volleyball. Your team will likely provide you a jersey. Jerseys must be a solid color, and the libero must be wearing a contrasting color to the rest of the team.Women’s jerseys are tight-fitting with short sleeves. Make sure that your shirt is snug but that you can still move your arms. Try stretching and rotating your arms when you try yours on to see how well you can move. Men wear looser jerseys with no sleeves. Make sure yours is not so loose that it can get caught in the net.  Volleyball shoes have special rubber soles that give them extra traction on the court. Two popular brands of volleyball shoes are Asics and Mizuno.Prices for good shoes range from $70 to $150.  Pick knee pads that fit you well and that cover your entire knee. The sleeve of the kneepad should be between 5 and 10 inches.More advanced players may want a shorter sleeve for maximum flexibility while newer players will want longer sleeves to increase their protection.  

wear shorts.  put on a jersey.  invest in a pair of volleyball shoes.  put on knee pads. 

 Switching medications can cause even more anxiety, as well as side effects. Therefore, when switching medications, it is very important to have a person in your life that you can rely on in times of need. This person can be a friend, family member, or partner. By having someone there, your transition will be more tolerable.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is often combined with medication to treat anxiety. CBT has proven to be very effective in treating anxiety disorders, even more so than anxiety medications. This is because CBT attempts to address the root of your anxiety; therefore the benefits tend to last beyond the end of treatment. Consult your doctor about getting CBT when changing medications.You can also try using other complementary strategies to control anxiety, such as deep breathing, meditation, and yoga., Exercise is also considered to be a very effective treatment in treating anxiety. Therefore, when switching medications, try to add exercise to your routine to lessen any side effects or anxieties you have when switching medications.However, always consult your doctor to see if exercise and other therapies are a good idea.  

have someone you can rely on.  supplement your medication with other therapies.  exercise. 

 Get rid of useless clothes, old papers, and broken things that you're not planning to fix. Donate any items that might still be usable to someone else, and throw out or recycle the rest.   When you're going through your clothes, actually try them on. It'll take a while but it's the only way to remember whether older clothes are worth keeping. Yes, you might have loved that shirt from five years ago, but if it doesn't fit and doesn't have extreme sentimental value, there's no reason to keep it anymore. Even if it does fit you, consider whether you've worn it in the last year. If not and if you're not about to wear it tomorrow, find it a new home through donation, and let someone else love it from here on out.  In simpler terms: put everything away when you're not using it. If every bit of clothing or other personal item has a "home", staying organized is easy. It's a lot of work to set up, but once you know which drawer houses your socks, which part of the closet is for shirts, and where your trousers go, it's easy to stick to it.  Once of the biggest sources of mess in people's rooms is dirty clothes. Get a big hamper or basket for dirty clothes, and every time you take something off that you don't plan on wearing again before you wash it, throw it right in there, rather than on the floor. Once the hamper is full (or even before), do a load of laundry. When the laundry is done, put the clothes away right away. Skipping the steps where dirty clothes clutter up the floor or clean clothes are sitting around waiting to be put away will help everything feel much more organized.  Some people love having a lot of sentimental mementos in their rooms. It's not exactly minimalist, but it's okay, as long as you keep them somewhat tidy and clean. Clean them every now and then so that they don't accumulate a lot of fluff and dust, and they'll only enhance your room.  Ok, everyone accumulates a fair share of junk that doesn't "fit" with other supplies. Designate one drawer or box/shelf in your closet for these items that don't "go" with anything else. Every few months, look through it and throw out what you don't need. Junk has a way of accumulating!  

sort out your clutter.  use your drawers, wardrobes, and built-in closets religiously.  do laundry regularly.  organize your trinkets and ornaments.  consider having a "junk" drawer or box. 

 Do not try to force the other person to eat. Don’t bribe your loved one to eat more, or use threats to compel behavior. Sometimes, anorexia is a response to a lack of feeling control over one’s own life. Engaging in a power struggle or taking control away from your loved one may only make the problem worse.Don’t try to “fix” your loved one’s problem. Recovery is as complex as the eating disorder. Trying to “fix” your loved one on your own may do more harm than good. Encourage him/her to see a mental health professional, instead.  Anorexia often involves a great deal of shame and embarrassment for the person suffering from it. Even if well-meaning, commenting on your loved one’s appearance, eating habits, weight, etc., can trigger his/her feelings of shame and disgust.   Compliments are also unhelpful. Because the person is dealing with a distorted body image, s/he is unlikely to believe you. S/he may interpret even positive comments as judgment or manipulation., If your loved one comments that s/he feels “fat,” it’s important not to respond by saying things like, “You’re not fat.” This only reinforces the unhealthy idea that “fat” is something innately bad that should be feared and avoided.Similarly, do not point out thin people and comment on their appearance, such as “Nobody wants to hug a bony person.” You want your loved one to develop a healthy body image, not focus on fearing or diminishing one particular type of body. Instead, ask your loved one where those feelings are coming from. Ask what s/he thinks s/he would gain by being thin, or what s/he fears about feeling overweight.  Anorexia and other eating disorders are highly complex and often co-occur with other illnesses, such as anxiety and depression. Peer and media pressure may play a role, as may family and social situations. Saying things such as “If you would just eat more, things would be fine” ignore the complexity of the issue your loved one is struggling with.   Instead, offer your support with “I”-statements: “I realize this is a tough time for you” or “Eating differently can be hard, and I believe in you.”  , The struggle to be “perfect” is a common factor in triggering anorexia. However, perfectionism is an unhealthy way of thinking that hampers your ability to adapt and be flexible, a crucial part of success in life.It holds you and others to an impossible, unrealistic, and ever-shifting standard.Do not expect perfection from your loved one or yourself. Recovering from an eating disorder may take a long time, and both of you will have times when you act in a way that you regret.   Acknowledge when one of you slips up, but don’t focus on it or beat yourself up for it. Instead, focus on what you can do going forward to avoid similar mistakes.  However, you do not want to help promote your loved one’s behavior. Anorexia may cause early death in up to 20% of its sufferers.It’s important to encourage your loved one to get help.   Understand that your loved one may initially be angry with you or even reject you for suggesting s/he needs help. This is common. Just continue to be there for your loved one and let him/her know that you support and care for him/her.  

refrain from trying to control the other person’s behavior.  avoid commenting on the other person’s behavior and appearance.  avoid “fat-shaming” or “skinny-shaming.” the healthy body weight for each person may differ.  avoid simplifying the matter.  avoid perfectionistic tendencies.  do not promise to “keep it a secret.” it may be tempting to agree to keep your loved one’s disorder a secret in order to gain his/her trust. 

 Pick a time when your puppy is energetic and hasn't eaten recently. Wait at least an hour after your puppy eats if you're going to play gently, or 90 minutes if you're going to play rough. If you don't wait enough between eating and playing, your puppy may get a stomach ache or even develop a life-threatening condition (gastric torsion) where the stomach swings over and twists on itself.If you're going to let kids play along during playtime, always make sure you or an adult are supervising. Your puppy may not understand the fine distinction between playing and teasing. If your puppy becomes frustrated, he may nip out of confusion.; , Not all puppies like the same things. Some like to run and hunt things, others like to chew, while others are motivated by smell and love to follow scent trails. Watch your puppy to see what makes him happy, and what he tends to do naturally. It may take you time to find out what your puppy likes.   For example, if he's always got his nose to the ground sniffing, then he probably likes to follow scents. Or, if he simply sits and watches a ball fly off, then he's probably not fond of fetch.  Add simple commands to playtime. For example, if your dog adores chasing a ball, then he'll be motivated to learn the command "give" in order to release the ball so you can throw it again. Or, your dog may obey commands like "sit" and "stay" if he knows you'll reward him with a game of fetch. You can also use a clicker to train while playing. For instance, you could click right before throwing the ball, tell him to "sit" and click again when he sits on the ground. This way, your dog associates the action with a reward of fetch.Realize that you don't have to reward your dog only with food. The reward of more playtime and your attention can be powerful motivators.  Since puppies are usually energetic, it's hard to remember that they can become overtired. A puppy has growing bones and slack ligaments supporting those bones. If he becomes overtired, he might move awkwardly and damage those growing joints. Make sure not to overtire the puppy, so stop while he still has some energy.When you do stop, end on a good note that leaves your puppy wanting more, instead of playing him till he's completely exhausted. If he's worn out, he'll become grumpy from tiredness.  While play might seem like a fun afterthought, it's actually an important way to socialize your dog. Dogs that play well and respond to basic commands are more fun to have around and are also more sociable. You can learn about your dog and his personality by playing games. You'll also discover dislikes or fears that your dog may have.   Not only will playing help you bond with your puppy, but it will give both of you a great chance for exercise. Play will also provide valuable mental stimulation for your puppy., Use a tugger rope toy designed for play, not another household item like a shoe. If you use something that's not a toy, your puppy will be confused into thinking he's allowed to play with household things. Pull somewhat gently on the tugger rope toy, since it is possible to damage your puppy's teeth by pulling too hard. If your puppy is under one year old, use caution when playing. Puppies have soft spots at the top of their heads that can injure easily.   Some people believe that playing tug-of-war can make your dog possessive. For this reason, you may not want to play it with large dogs from guarding breeds. Their superior physical strength and protective instinct could cause them to dominate.Your puppy may benefit from playing tug-of-war if he's shy or anxious. Allowing him to win could boost his confidence., Tell your puppy to "sit" and "stay." Show him a treat and then hide yourself. Call your puppy's name when you're in your hiding place. He should search until he finds you. This game teaches your puppy to come when called and how to find you when you cannot be seen. It will also give your puppy practice at following scents.   If your puppy breaks from the "stay" command before you've reached your hiding place, try commanding your puppy to "wait.", Show your puppy a ball or toy and command him to "sit" or "wait". Throw the toy a short distance and encourage the puppy to both get the toy, but to come back to you. Coach him through the process by saying things like "get it" and "bring it" and make a big fuss for every successful stage of the game. End the game on a high note while it is still interesting to the puppy. This will also establish your authority.   Fetch can teach your puppy to give on command, a valuable skill that could keep him safe. Once your puppy is holding the toy he fetched, offer a high-value reward. Give the command "give" at the moment he drops the toy and reward him with the treat.Never throw sticks when playing fetch. Your puppy could accidentally run onto a stick, causing a painful injury., Once your puppy has mastered basic commands, teach a few tricks like rolling over or playing dead. Spend about 10 minutes each session and be sure to offer rewards for correct behavior before your name the trick.For example, show your puppy what you want him to do, like getting him to give you a paw, and reward him him when he does it correctly several times in a row. Then you can begin calling the command "shake."   Tricks exercise your puppy's mind, teach focus and enable you to bond. Do no overwork any given trick, just revisit it often and always end on a high note. You can also try mind games like teaching your puppy the location of his toys, family members, and where his bed is. Then, hide an item like car keys and tell your puppy to "go find" them.  

choose a good time to play.  learn what your puppy likes.  train during playing.  know when to end playing.  recognize the benefits of play.  play tug-of-war.  play hide and seek.  have a game of fetch.  teach your dog tricks. 

 Remove only enough as required by the connector, terminal, etc. for connection. A "strip gauge" is often provided near the terminal of devices (switches, outlets, etc.) and should be checked before striping insulation. Additionally, the packaging of wirenuts and other connectors usually indicate how much insulation should be removed from a wire or cable. It is very important not to nick the wire in the insulation striping process. The size of the wire is critical, and a nick can create a hot spot whenever the circuit is loaded. This resulting spot expands and contracts with each heating and cooling cycle, and over time, effectively loosens the connection. Removing too much insulation increases the likelihood of accidental contact with something other than intended. Accidental contact can result in arc flashes, shock, burns and even loss of life.  Connectors, terminals, lugs, etc. have a rating for the type of wire material i.e.: copper (CU) or aluminum (AL) and copper clad - aluminum. The connector will bear either the "CU" or "AL" mark. A third mark, "CU/AL" indicates the connector is suitable for either copper or aluminum. Never mix copper and aluminum conductors in a single terminal, unless it specifically designed for the mix.  These typically are a special design used to connect an aluminum and copper wire together so that a short copper jumper or pigtail may be connected to a CU rated terminal. These were common in the 70's when aluminum wiring was used to supply 15 & 20 amp circuits in residential and some commercial structures. It was learned that aluminum wire wasn't well suited for connection to the terminals on common outlets and switches. Use of a copper jumper connected between the screw terminal of the switch or outlet and the building's aluminum wire via special connector solved this problem. Manufacture of aluminum wire for these purposes has ceased and now aluminum wire and cable is manufactured in larger sizes for connection to an electric range, service equipment and other high current uses. Terminal ratings are for wires made of either CU (copper only) or CU/AL (copper OR aluminum but not both at the same time).  Once the correct CU or AL terminal has been chosen, make sure the required temperature rating of the wire is met by the terminal. A wire or cable with a 90 degree Centigrade (or C) rating may have been installed to take advantage of the higher current carrying capacity or "ampacity" rating provided over a similar cable with only a 75 or 60 degree rated cable insulation. All the terminals to which the wire will connect must meet the 90 degree C minimum rating as well, otherwise the ampacity of the wire will be reduced. This reduction may require a larger size wire or cable to replace the original. Cost of higher temperature terminals increase - while the availability goes down., Simply stated, unless indicated otherwise, only one wire is permitted to be terminated under a terminal (such as those on bus bars, switches, outlets, etc.), unless specifically designed to connect 2 or more (such as wirenuts, split bolts, etc.). Additionally, it is not permissible to split strands of wires or cable so that they may be terminated under more than one terminal or screw. The correct sized terminal for the wire or cable to be connected must be used., All of these prerequisites are for naught if insufficient pressure is applied. Use a torque wrench if need to obtain the proper pressure. Simple terminals on switches and outlets should be made tight - but if unsure, it is better that these be over tightened than under., Commercially available inhibitors are usually sold wherever aluminum wire is offered. The packaging explains how to prepare the wire and how to apply. Typically, a freshly stripped wire need not be "wire brushed" unless it is oxidizing already. Oxidation of aluminum metals appears as a white or gray flaky or dusty residue on the surface. Clean with a wire bristle brush to remove the residue completely. Apply a liberal coating of oxide inhibitor over the entire surface of the exposed aluminum. Try to force it between the strands and the end of the wire. Do not leave so much inhibitor on the wire so that it will drip off. Remove enough excess inhibitor to prevent this from happening before inserting into the terminal., There is no need for a great deal of the conductor to hang out of a terminal. Any part of the stripped wire that is not touching the surface of the terminal, connector, etc. is doing nothing to help maintain conductivity of the circuit or its mechanical strength, and should be removed. Leaving just enough of the wire to be visible (up to 1/4 inch) out of any lug, terminal or split-bolt so as to allow the wire to be determined that it is connected very quickly. No stripped portion of conductors should be visible outside of wirenut type connectors. The non-conductive skirt at the open end of the wirenut provides insulation to any part of the conductor that may have been stripped slightly too much., Some connectors such a "split bolts" and "burndys" are uninsulated, and must be insulated to protect them from accidentally contacting other conductors and people. The general rule of thumb is to place at least the same amount of tape on these connectors as is on the wires and cables that enter them. Vinyl electrical tape is not very thick, so a thick rubber filler tape designed expressly for this application can save a great deal of time spent wrapping tape. Use the filler tape to provide 75% to 95% of the thickness of the wire's insulation on the connector and use the vinyl electrical tape to finish to 100% thickness. Make sure the tapes evenly cover the entire surface of all exposed metal of the connector and wires or cables., Larger cables usually only come in black jacketed insulation. It is important to identify these conductors with colored tape or paint depending on location. Painting is often done when exposed outdoors such as at a weather head for an electrical service, but tape is still very popular here too. In the U.S. use black, red, blue, identify line voltage cables, white for grounded neutrals and green for equipment grounds and bonds in 120 / 240 volt systems only. Use brown, orange and yellow for line voltage cables, gray for grounded neutral and green for equipment grounds and bonds in 480 / 277 volt systems only. 

carefully remove insulation.  use only connectors rated for the type wire.  use correct terminal temperature ratings.  use terminals rated for the size of the wire(s).  torque all screws, terminals and lugs to specified rating.  use an oxide inhibitor on aluminum wires and cables.  trim any excess exposed wires as needed.  replace insulation as needed.  mark the conductors. 

 Consult with your primary care physician to see if he or she can recommend a dermatologist to help you with your dark spots. See which of the commercial OTC products they might recommend. There are a number of treatments that your doctor may recommend, which include:Azelaic acid- a natural acid found in grains and is used to lighten or fade dark spots. Vitamin C cream- promotes healing and collagen formation, which is a protein that strengthens and provides elasticity to the skin. Tretinoin cream + mequinol- retinoids, such as tretinoin, can make your skin very sensitive to the sun, so be sure to follow your dermatologists’ directions. Corticosteroid creams- reduce inflammation, which should fade the dark spots. Glycolic acid peels- these remove the top layers of skin to reduce dark spots. Others topical treatments can include: kojic acid (derived from fungi), arbutin (derived from the bearberry), licorice extracts (derived from the licorice plant), niacinamide (a form of niacin), and N-acetyl glucosamine (a supplement).  Decide whether you would like to move forward with more extreme treatment options. A dermatologist can also give you some insight about what type of dark spots you have.   There is a condition called “Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation.” After acne, your skin over-reacts and produces too much skin pigment and you get dark spots. This may describe your dark spots. Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation can occur in anyone, but tends to occur in darker skinned individuals.  Decide whether you want to move forward with the suggestions of the dermatologist. There are a variety of specialized treatments that dermatologists can provide. These include laser treatments, minor skin surgeries, chemical peels, and using fillers to tighten the skin. All of these procedures can usually be done in a medical office. 

talk to your physician.  consult with a dermatologist.  consider possible treatments that a dermatologist can provide. 

 Aspirin is known to increase the uric acid in the blood by slowing its excretion. This can worsen the symptoms of gout., This group of drugs are known to relieve pain and decrease inflammation – two of the most common symptoms of gout.   Ibuprofen should be taken by mouth in doses of 800 mg, every 3-4 hours. However, your doctor may adjust the dosage depending on the condition of your kidney.Indomethacin should be taken four times a day in doses of 25 to 50 mg dosage. Dosage adjustment may also be necessary depending on the patient's overall treatment plan for the kidney failure., This drug is effective in preventing gout flare ups. Though it is not completely known how colchicine works, it is believed that it suppresses the activity of neutrophil and leukocytes, leading to decreased inflammation.Take an initial dose of colchicine during a gout flare up. It should be 1.2 mg by mouth and 0.6 mg an hour later.The maximum dosage of colchicines that can be taken in an hour is 1.8 mg by mouth. A very high dose of colchicines may lead to gastrointestinal upset., If you have a known allergy to NSAIDs, corticosteroids may be a good alternative. Corticosteroids act by inhibiting and suppressing inflammation in the body.   Corticosteroids are also known as immunosuppressant drugs – meaning they suppress the body's immune system. Take 30-40 mg of oral corticosteroids once per day.., This drug is usually used for the long-term management of gout since it is more likely to be tolerated by the body and is relatively inexpensive. To produce uric acid from purine metabolism, xanthine oxidase is needed. With the help of allupurinol, the production of xanthine oxidase is inhibited.The initial dose of allupurinol is 100 mg per day. This dosage may be increased to 200 to 300 mg (for mild gout) or 400-600 mg (for moderate to severe gout) per day.Allupurinol is especially prescribed to people with kidney failure who suffering from gout as a result.  This drug is a uricosuric agent which works to lowering uric acid by promotion the elimination ability of the kidneys. It should be noted that probenecid should never be used as part of the initial treatment of gout flare-ups, but rather it should be used as a maintenance drug.The maintenance dosage is 500 mg by mouth, every 12 hours. Your doctor may decide to increase this dosage by 500 mg each month, until uric acid is decreased and controlled. 

never use aspirin to treat uric acid.  take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or nsaids.  take colchicine.  take corticosteroids.  take allupurinol.  take probenecid.

 Don’t bottle your feelings up. Anger and other negative emotions can trigger a relapse if you don’t address them. Go for a long walk, clean your house, or vent in a journal when you feel your emotions building up., Mindfulness can help you process the emotions of recovery without letting them control you. To become more mindful, focus on what’s happening right now, both inside and outside you. Observe your sensations, thoughts, and feelings without judging them.Meditation and yoga are two good ways to develop the habit of mindfulness.  For many people, loneliness is a big trigger for relapse, so don’t isolate yourself. Talk to your family members, friends, therapist, and other people in your support network frequently. If you aren’t already a member, consider joining a group like Alcoholics Anonymous for extra support.If you don’t feel like seeing other people, make yourself do it anyways. Start small. Pick up the phone to call a friend, or ask a family member to get coffee with you.  Think about what kind of new, sober life you want to build. Ask yourself what you need from other people and what kind of influences you don’t want to spend time around anymore. Let the people close to you know about your new boundaries, and decide what you will do if someone does not respect your boundaries.For example, you might set the boundary that you will not spend time with your old friends who are still addicted to drugs. Be polite but firm about your boundaries. Say something like, “No, I can’t hang out with you. I need to put my recovery first right now.”  , Make time to have fun on a regular basis. Rediscover the activities you liked to do before you became addicted, or pick up a completely new hobby that you’ve always wanted to try. Give yourself something to look forward to every day.For instance, you could express your emotions through painting, teach yourself a foreign language, or join an adult sports league to make new friends.  Therapy is an essential part of recovery. A therapist can help keep you accountable, and they can help you learn new ways to cope with your emotions without turning to alcohol or drugs. A therapist can also help you problem-solve difficulties in your life using the HALT concepts, such as identifying triggers and figuring out mood changes.Even if you have already completed a residential therapy program, your aftercare should include some kind of counseling.  

find healthy ways to express your emotions.  practice mindfulness.  stay connected to others.  set boundaries.  do things you enjoy.  see a therapist regularly.

 Keeping a food diary can give you a better understanding of the number of calories you're consuming each day. Estimate your portions so you can use nutritional information to determine how many calories are included in each of your meals.Keep your food diary for at least a week so you can get a daily average. Take note of days that seem out of the ordinary and try to figure out why you were consuming so much more (or so much less) on that day than on others. This can help you identify triggers that cause you to overeat.; , As with your food, it might also be helpful to keep a physical activity diary for a period of at least one week. This can help you determine your average level of physical activity during the day.Be sure to include daily activities as well as dedicated exercise times. For example, if you routinely walk up three flights of stairs to get to your office each morning, this should be included as physical activity. Cleaning the house or walking the dog also are daily physical activities. You also need to calculate the period of time when you are not active. For example, if you spend four hours a day sitting at your desk at work, this should be included in your physical activity diary.  Your daily calorie needs depend on your age, sex, and physical activity level. Use your physical activity diary to determine which general category you fall into: sedentary, moderately active, or active.Look for tables or calculators online that will enable you to estimate your daily calorie needs. For example, you can find a table in the dietary guidelines established by the U.S. government, available at https://health.gov/. Finding a general category will not give you an exact number of calories you must consume each day to maintain a healthy weight, but it will give you a good estimate. If you find that you are gaining weight despite using this estimate, you can adjust downward by 200 calories until you find the right balance.  While your goal may be to maintain a healthy weight, your weight may fluctuate between 5 and 10 pounds regularly for a number of different reasons that are unrelated to your eating or physical activity level, such as hormones or stress.The key to maintaining a healthy weight is finding the right balance between the calories you're consuming and the calories your body is burning for fuel. You may not be able to maintain your weight simply by consuming the same amount of calories all the time. Revisit your calorie calculations once a month or so and make adjustments as necessary. If you find you're gaining or losing weight, you may want to keep a food and physical activity diary for a week. Compare the week's entries to previous weeks you've done and see if you can identify the differences that are causing weight gain or loss.  Your BMI looks at your percentage of body fat rather than simply your weight, which makes it a better way to gauge whether your weight is in a healthy range for you. If your BMI is too high or too low, you should focus on eating and exercising to gain or lose weight, not to maintain your current weight.The easiest way to calculate your BMI is by using an online chart.Make sure you have accurate height and weight measurements before you begin.  Even if your BMI is in a relatively healthy range, your waist circumference may be too large. Carrying excess abdominal fat puts you at risk of developing obesity-related conditions such as Type 2 Diabetes and high blood pressure.If your waist circumference is too high, you should diet and exercise to lose more weight around your midsection.   Wrap a tape measure around your waist, just above your hips, while standing. The tape measure should be tight, but not squeezing or pressing into your skin. Make sure it's straight and horizontal around your waist. Take a deep breath in, then exhale and place your finger on the larger number where the end of the tape reaches. This is your waist circumference. You are at risk for developing obesity-related health conditions if you are a man and your waist circumference is larger than 40 inches (about 101 cm), or if you are a non-pregnant woman and your waist circumference is larger than 35 inches (about 89 cm).  

keep a food diary.  assess your level of physical activity.  determine your daily calorie needs.  adjust your caloric intake as needed.  calculate your body mass index (bmi).  measure your waist circumference.

 There are so many to choose from, so start thinking now. Themes that you might like to make use of include:   Haunted theme Ghostly theme Horror theme Fairytale theme Pumpkin theme (everything orange!) Graveyard theme Costume theme (anything goes); , Before you hit any store, create a list that sets out:   Decorations you'd like to have Types of food Music Prizes and games (optional) Movies (optional) Other ideas  , This will give you an idea of numbers and the space and food needed. If you have a specific theme (like movies), you may want to limit your number so you don't end up with 12 Freddie Kruegers.   If the party is in your house, limit it to a number you can handle. After all, you're the host -- the party blunders (and successes) lie on your shoulders.  Use your chosen theme to guide the invitation creation. Set the time, date, and give any details about what to wear, bring, etc. Send these out about two weeks prior to the party. For some invitation ideas:   Grab some black construction paper, a template off the internet, and design and cut out a witch's hat. To write in the necessary details, use a white or silver gel pen.  If a witch's hat isn't your cup o' tea, cut out pumpkins, ghosts, tombstones, or black cats out of construction paper instead. If you put it in an envelope, add in some Halloween-themed confetti for an extra touch.   Buy a bunch of small pumpkins or gourds from your local grocery store or farmer's market. In permanent marker, draw a funny face on the front and have the details on the back. Be sure to let it dry though! Otherwise you risk everything smearing.  

consider the style of halloween party that interests you.  write down your ideas.  consider the people you'd like to invite.  prepare invitations. 

 You may need to make the pieces shorter or longer depending on the size of your quilt, however.  Place the corner of the strip 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) down and 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) over.  Even though the self-adhesive Velcro should stay on the quilt by itself, a quick stitch will give it extra support.  The strips should be on the inside of the wallpaper frame, about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) in and 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) down to match the location of the strips on the quilt.  The Velcro pieces should be evenly aligned, and the quilt should fit perfectly inside the wallpaper border.  

cut four pieces of self-adhesive velcro.the width of the velcro should be pre-set at 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) and you should cut lengths of about 2 inches (5 cm) for a 36 by 36 inch (1 by 1 meter) quilt.  stick one side of each velcro strip in each corner of the quilt.  stitch the velcro in place.  stick the other side of each velcro strip on the wall.  align the velcro and stick together. 

 If he is dating another girl and she finds out you kissed him, that could get dramatic.; , Sometimes girls have trouble figuring out if they really do have a crush on "him". This is the time you have to do some investigating. Make a "check list" of 12 things you want most out of your typical dream guy. Sneak around and see what he does, but don't stalk him. He has to have the exact or related things to your quality on that list. He must get a result of 6/12 or above, otherwise he's not really for you. But, if he turns out to be your typical guy, talk to him once in a while to feel comfortable around him for later. Make sure he is into you even if you have to play hard to get.  Simple things like smiling at him are not so hard. If you're constantly doing that already, then you can go ahead and skip this step. Don't overdo it though. Technically, the trick here is to not flirt with him (yet). Give him hints for about a week or two and see what happens. Don't overdo this step.  By now, he should start to show some signs he has some interest towards you as well. Don't assume this is going to happen right away, it may take some time for him to express it. If nothing happens at all, repeat step 3 until he does. Signs he might show are:   constant staring touching you on the arm or shoulder (doesn't necessarily include tapping) smiling, etc.  Now that he's showing signs, you should become friends (unless your crush is already your friend, you can skip this step and move on). This should happen before he asks you out because, it might be so sudden, you might say "no" and he'll feel kind of upset and leave you alone for some time. So, to become friends with him, do the same as you did when you became friends with a guy you don't have a crush on. If your crush is showing signs, the best way to be friends with him is to start by sitting next to him at lunch and start a conversation and find things in common(ex: you're both sports fanatics). Hang out with him for about 2 weeks and eventually you're friends. What might happen is that he might lose interest in you. So to boost his interest up, it's time for you to move on to step 6.  It's like giving him hints, but a tad bit more advanced; your hand on his hand, your head on his shoulder (if he doesn't mind), still smiling constantly and turning away when he notices, kinda teasing him from time to time, hug him when he meets up with you to talk, giggling or making short laughs any time he tries to make you laugh. Do this for 10-13 days or until he starts to do the same back at you.   Don't overdo it - keep it light. Flirting with him too much could make him uncomfortable.  Mostly at this point, girls may get a little jumpy. Keep cool though. Don't make it seem like you're planning something. To make your "move", tell your crush to meet you somewhere you know personally that not a lot of people go (but not somewhere dangerous, like an alley). If you want to do this after school, you could invite him over to your house to do homework together, but you can also choose a place like the park or the beach; maybe even in the back of the school or in the school courtyard.   Meet him at a time when there aren't many people around, like 5 or 6 o'clock. This way there's not too many people around to see you and him, but make sure the place isn't completely empty, because you don't want to make him feel suspicious about what's going on.  When you meet him at the location, greet him by giving him a quick hug. Tell him to sit somewhere (grass, bench, etc.). After a short period of time being quiet, start a small conversation about something that happened a few days ago. If he gets more interested in the story, he might say something to make you smile at the end. Otherwise he'll probably start talking about whatever he likes to talk about. If you didn't like the story too much or it didn't catch your interest, tell another story and if he ends it with a really nice line, say something that might make him look at you and smile. If it does work, look at him and smile back. Try locking the gaze into a stare. Hold it long it enough to make him fade out his smile. Fade out your smile too to make it seem you lost control of yourself. Now he is under your spell. Move over a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) closer to him. If he moves forward too it means he's interested in what's happening. If he scoots backward and looks to his side, he's signaling that he's unsure on what's happening or he's shy. If he looks away or says something, it means he's not ready for what's about to happen.  Now that you've locked in the gaze, it's time. If his hand is within reach, put your hand on top gently. He might take your fingers and wrap them under his hand. Lean in a little; if he leans in too, he signals he's definitely ready. Get closer, inches from each other's face. If he sits still, he's unsure if he's ready. If he's not really sure, let him know it's okay by putting your cheek against his then lightly plant a kiss on his cheek. If he lightens up, plant a kiss on his lips. If he responds to it by shivering a little or making any small movements, move in a little more and gently tug on his arm to signal him to get closer. Win his attention again by staring into his eyes. If it works, make the big move. Tilt your head 9 degrees in which ever way you are leaning into him. Sometimes boys don't respond to the first lip-to-lip. Try it again and again until he responds. When he does, start the kiss soft and passionate. Tip: think about happy things. This will make things more intense.   Bring your arms up slowly and wrap them around his neck gently. He might respond to that by putting his hands on your waist. Eventually, he doesn't have to respond. If you both are still kissing, then he's still into you and the moment. If he backs away from you when you lean in, that's a no. Respect that; don't kiss him when he's not comfortable.  

make sure he is single.  see if he's the right boy.  give him hints to show you're interested in him.  look for signs that tell he is interested as well.  become friends.  flirt.  ask him to "hang out".  show more interest and intimacy.  kiss. 

 For most cacti of desert origin, a good general soil mixture consists of two parts garden soil, two parts coarse sand, and one part peat.This mixture is meant to drain well, and not harden when it is dry.Use a clay pot as well--their heaviness helps keep bulkier cacti from tipping over; they also allow the soil to breathe, preventing the roots from rotting., Test the moisture level by pressing your finger into the top inch of the soil. If it is completely dry, water the cactus fully, allowing excess water to drain out the hole in the bottom of the pot , Cacti need different amounts of water depending on whether they’re growing or dormant. During the growing season of March to September, water them, on average, once a month. During the dormant season of October to February, water only once per month at the most. Watering too much during the dormant season is the main cause of complications with cacti., Most cacti need lots of sun. In the summer, keep the cactus outdoors, being careful not to let it get too much rain. Start it in a shady area at first, gradually moving it into sunnier areas to avoid sunburn.In the winter, place the pot in a southern- or western- facing window, which have the best sun exposure.  Cacti like cooler temperatures during their dormant period in the winter. But be careful to keep them out of the way of drafts--away from leaky windows and off the floor near doors.A healthy temperature range at night in the winter is 45 - 60 degrees Fahrenheit (7 - 16 degrees Celsius),so a basement or a room that gets less heat would be suitable storage areas during this period.   Unless you have a cold-hardy cactus, be careful not to let the room temperature drop below freezing, since most cacti can’t tolerate frost., You’ll know it’s time to transplant your cactus to a larger pot when either it becomes too top-heavy for the pot to support it, or when it grows within one inch of the edge of the pot.Use a standard potting mixture consisting of two parts garden soil, two parts coarse sand, and one part peat.Replant the cactus at the same level in the soil as it was in the original pot.  A common result of over-watering is root rot, which happens when roots sit for too long in poorly-drained, moist soil. Before repotting, gently brush away the soil from the roots after removing the old soil ball from the original pot. Inspect the root system, and cut away any soft black roots, or any dried-up roots that appear dead. Cut just up to the part of the root that is still living.You can avoid root rot by making sure the your pot has a hole in the bottom for drainage, and that it never sits in excess water that collects in a saucer underneath the pot., If the roots are damaged when you remove the cactus from its original pot, or if you needed to cut away dead roots, let the cactus sit for about ten days out of its soil. This will allow it time to form calluses around the damaged or cut areas. Place it on a piece of paper, out of the sun but away from cool temperatures.Cacti do best after repotting if you transplant them during the growing season (March to September).Most cacti should generally be repotted every one-to-two years., Most fertilizers are given a number rating that indicates how much nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium they contain (in the form: N-Ph.-Po.) An example of a low-nitrogen fertilizer appropriate for cacti is 10-30-20, where the Nitrogen content is rated at 10.Too much nitrogen gives the cactus a flabby texture that impedes its growth.Never fertilize a cactus during the dormant season (October to February)., If the skin of your cactus is dusty or dirty, it may not be able to photosynthesize properly.Wash off this residue with a rag or sponge and a solution of with one drop of dish soap. Then rinse the plant under a faucet or with a soaked sponge.  

use an appropriate soil mixture.  water only when the soil is dry.  adjust watering according to the seasons.  provide enough sunlight.  monitor the room temperature.  repot your cactus according to its growth.  cut away dead roots.  don’t immediately repot damaged roots.  use a fertilizer low in nitrogen.  wash away dust and dirt. 

 To determine if you have high blood sugar, your doctor may order a fasting plasma glucose test, a test two hours after giving you 75 grams of oral glucose, or by checking your hemoglobin A1c. All of these tests can be performed in medical setting to establish if a person has diabetes. Hyperglycemia is generally defined as a blood sugar level that is greater than 180 mg/dL.You can purchase a digital one-touch tester at any major retailer or pharmacy for as little at $15. Make sure that you use sterile lancets (purchased in a pharmacy) for the device. You will also need single use alcohol pads to use prior to pricking yourself. Use a pad to wipe your fingertip and then let it dry before pricking yourself with the sterile lancet. You should also check your blood sugar in the morning before you eat. This will give you a sense of how your body is processing sugar.  A diet with at least 50 grams of fiber can help lower blood sugar levels. It will also boost your metabolism and cultivate probiotics in your stomach and intestines.You can get fiber from a wide variety of foods. Try whole-wheat pasta, bran, oats, citric fruits, berries, beans, nuts, or roughage vegetables like artichokes, spinach, or broccoli. If consistent blood sugar elevations are suspected, see a healthcare provider. Uncontrolled diabetes can cause long term damage to target organs including the eyes, heart, kidneys, and peripheral vascular system.  A reduction in dietary sugar has a direct effect on the blood sugar level. A physician may recommend that a severely hyperglycemic or diabetic patient eliminate sugar from his or her diet.Avoid candy, soda, baked treats, and added sugar. Avoid foods with white carbohydrates which turn into sugar after they’re metabolized. This includes white breads, pasta, potatoes, and cereal.  Most foods, especially processed foods, will have some amount of sugar in them. Unless you’re severely hyperglycemic, this should be fine in moderation but can be problematic if you take in a lot of sugar at once. Smaller meals can also help to keep the blood sugar in check.Always be sure to check the sugar content of any processed food you eat.  Prolonged activities, such as biking or running, can effectively lower the blood sugar level as the sugar is consumed for fuel. Cardio exercises and weight training are highly effective at burning sugar.If you don’t have time for a full exercise at the gym, try going for a walk or even just standing up when you would normally sit.  Refrain from aerobic exercise if your blood sugar level is above 240 mg/dl and your urine also contains ketones. This combination of conditions can cause the ketone levels in the blood to rise to dangerous levels during exercise.If your urine is excessively dark in color, this is potentially a sign of high ketone levels and you should go to see a doctor right away.  If you are diagnosed with diabetes, then your healthcare provider should create a plan to help you keep your diabetes under control. This plan may include regular blood sugar tests, insulin injections, and lifestyle changes like diet and exercise. Diabetics with severe hyperglycemia may need an injection of insulin to quickly lower the blood sugar level in an emergency. You will need a prescription from your doctor.Always swab the injection site with rubbing alcohol first. Be sure to ask your doctor about proper injection procedures if you don’t know where or how to inject.  

diagnose high blood sugar.  eat more fiber.  cut down your sugar intake.  reduce portion sizes.  exercise regularly.  don’t over extend yourself.  inject insulin. 

 Check your cat's splint or bandage at least twice daily to make sure that it is dry and secure. Time these observations with other normal activities, such as brushing or after-meal relaxation. If your cat demonstrates unease when you check the bandage, use treats or gentle petting to calm it down.If your cat resists contact with its bandaged area, simply observe it visually to assess its condition.; , To ensure that the wound under your cat's bandage or splint does not get infected, check for signs of infection around the edge of the wrapping. An infection may lead to more serious complications and should be treated immediately. Bring your cat to the vet as soon as possible if you see:Swollen or red skin Foul odor Discharge Sores  , Observe your cat's bandage or splint at least twice a day to make sure it doesn't get loose or tighten around your cat's limb. The latter may be evident if your cat's toes begin to swell, indicating that circulation is being cut off.

 Add 40 grams of semolina… 2 teaspoons of caster sugar… 1 and a half teaspoons of salt… and 2 and a half tablespoons of olive oil. Then add 10 grams of dried yeast. This is the ingredient which will make the dough rise. Mix well.; , Mix with a wooden spoon until it forms a soft dough. It shouldn't be too sticky, so stop adding the water when it is firm.  Use your hands to knead it by pushing away with the palms of your hands, and pulling it back with your fingers, turning it frequently. Keep kneading for about 10 minutes. The dough will become soft and silky to touch. Form a compact ball.  Put the dough in and cover either with cling film or a clean cloth. Put the bowl in a warm place and leave it to rise for about 45 minutes, or until it has puffed up and feels soft and springy to touch.  Put 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1 400g tin of tomatoes, 1 teaspoon of herbs, a good twist of black pepper, and 2 pinches of salt into a saucepan. Place on the hob, and turn on to a medium to low heat. Give it a quick stir. Leave it to thicken for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure it doesn't burn. Then take it off the heat, and leave to cool until it's needed.  Lightly flour a surface and roll the dough into a long sausage shape. Then slice off small fist sized pieces. Shape each piece into a disc, then roll out into a small circle.  Lightly flour a baking tray and place the pizzas on. Move the bases to a warm place. Leave them to rise for again, this time for about 15 to 20 minutes  ,, Spoon a little of sauce onto each pizza base, and spread it out. Now it's time to get creative with your toppings, try the following; Slice the mozzarella and arrange on the pizzas. Split the anchovies in 2 and lay in a cross. If your olives have stones, remove them, cut in two and place them on the pizza. Sprinkle over a few pinches of herbs. Arrange a few caper berries or capers. Whatever you like!  ,,, Of course, this always the best and most important step of them all. Enjoy!!!  

place 500 grams of strong white bread flour into a large bowl.  gradually stir in 300 millimeters of water.  knead the dough .sprinkle a little flour onto a work surface and turn the dough out.  let the dough rise.lightly oil a large bowl- this will prevent the dough from sticking to the sides.  prepare the tomato sauce.while the dough is rising you can prepare the sauce.  roll out the base.  rise again .  preheat the oven.turn the oven to 230 °c (446 °f), leaving it to preheat while the dough rises.  ,  topping.when risen, bring the pizza bases back to the work surface.  rise again.put the pizzas in a warm dry place and leave to prove again for about 10 minutes.  ,  bake.then, transfer to the oven to bake for 20 minutes, or until the bases are evenly cooked and golden, and the cheese has melted.  ,  enjoy.

 This paper will become your tracing paper, so you’ll want to start with a sheet that’s already fairly thin. Regular printer paper works well for this process., You’ll need a few more items before you begin making your tracing paper. Fortunately, most of these materials should be available around your house. You’ll need:   One tablespoon of oil in a cup. You’ll be applying this oil to your paper and may need more than a tablespoon depending on the size of the paper. Ideally, use vegetable, coconut or baby oil. Olive oil is thicker and may oversaturate the paper.A large, thick-bristled paintbrush to apply the oil. Newspaper, cardboard or a plastic container. Paper towels or a washcloth. A hair dryer (optional).  Find a flat surface such as a table or desk to work on. You’ll want to make sure it’s protected since you’ll be working with oil. Before you start, place some newspaper on your workspace.   The oil may drip or accidently spill, so it’s a good idea to cover the entire surface with newspaper. Alternatively, place your paper on a piece of cardboard or inside a large plastic container.  Gently paint the entire surface area on one side of the paper. The oil will soak in as you work and you should notice the paper becoming thin and transparent.Paint past the edges of the paper to ensure you’ve applied oil to the entire sheet. You won’t have to worry about making a mess as long as your workspace is protected. You only need to apply one thin coat of oil to the paper. Dab your paintbrush on the side of the cup before application so the oil doesn’t pool up. The paper will become more transparent as it starts to dry.  You might find it hard to gauge how much oil you’re applying to the paper. Pat both sides of the paper with a cloth or paper towel if the paper seems too wet when you’re finished.  The oil needs to dry completely before you can use your tracing paper. This may take up to 24 hours, but if you don’t want to wait as long you can use a hair dryer to speed up the drying process. Once the paper dries completely, your tracing paper will be ready to use!   Sunlight will help the paper dry more quickly, so put your tracing paper by a window., A soft, finely pointed pencil works well on tracing paper.Tape your tracing paper to the original print or drawing. When you’ve finished tracing, leave one side taped to the print and examine the original image. This method makes it easier to realign your tracing paper if you need to make changes.  Depending on your project, you may want to transfer your finished tracing to drawing paper. To accomplish this, use a pencil to darken the back of the tracing paper after you’ve finished your tracing. Place your tracing paper over the drawing paper and retrace your lines using a sharp pencil. The graphite on the back of the tracing paper will create the final image on your drawing paper.   Mechanical pencils retain a hard point and will work best for transferring your tracing. You may need to touch up your final image after you transfer your tracing onto drawing paper. Be sure to hold onto your tracing in case you need to use it again.  Tracing paper can smudge and rip easily, so you’ll want to make sure you store it properly. When you’ve finished using your tracing paper, wash your hands to prevent smudging. Keep your tracing paper separated from other projects in a dry location.   For extra protection, wrap your tracing paper in glassine, a transparent, glossy paper used to preserve prints and drawings.  

start with a piece of regular paper.  gather additional materials.  prepare your workspace.  apply oil to the paper with your paintbrush.  use a paper towel to absorb excess oil.  allow your paper to dry overnight.  use a pencil to create your tracing.  transfer your tracing to drawing paper.  preserve your tracing paper. 

 How much PVC pipe you'll need depends on how big you want your ladder to be - see the sample measurements below. You can find 1-inch PVC pipe at a hardware store, as well as nylon rope. Buy 2 elbow fittings, 6 T fittings, and 4 stoppers. Make sure the golf balls you choose are solid all the way through, and buy them at a sporting goods store or big-box store.   Buy PVC cement (optional). You can fit your PVC pipe together without glue, but your ladder will be a lot less stable.; , Use a hacksaw, a miter saw or a plastic pipe cutter. You can size your ladder however you want, but here's a sample to work from. For this ladder, you'll need 19 feet (5.8 m) of 1-inch PVC pipe.   Cut 6 18-inch (0.45 m) pieces. Cut 4 12-inch (30.5 cm) pieces. Cut 3 24-inch (0.61 m) pieces.  Build the ladder from the base upward. You can use PVC cement as you do this, or you can just rely on the fittings.   Put 3 18-inch (.045 m) pipes into each opening of a T fitting. Repeat with another T fitting and 3 more 18-inch pipes. Hold them so that the "bottom" leg of the T is pointing straight up, and put the stoppers on the ends of the pipe parallel to the ground. These will make up your base. Put T fittings on top of each 18-inch (0.45 m) pipe that's pointing up. Do it such that the "leg" of each T is horizontal and pointing toward the other T fitting. Add a rung. Put one of the 24-inch (0.61 m) pipes between the T fittings you just added. Put a 12-inch (30.5 cm) pipe into each of the remaining T openings. These should be vertical. Add another rung. Put another T fitting on top of the 12-inch (30.5 cm) pipes, again so that the legs are vertical and pointing inward. Place another 24-inch (0.61 m) pipe into the T fittings for your second rung. Put another 12-inch (30.5 cm) pipe into each of the remaining T openings. Top the 12-inch (30.5 cm) pipes with the elbow fittings. Add your last rung. In the remaining spots in the elbow fittings, add your last 24-inch (0.61 m) pipe. If you used PVC cement, make the ladder first and allow the glue to dry while you make the bolos.  

purchase 1-inch (2.5 cm) pvc pipe, fittings, golf balls and nylon rope.  cut all of your pvc pieces to size.  fit the pipes together.

 This type of living isn't for everyone, and you'll need to rely on survival instincts to make it each day.; , Since you simply cannot run to a shower house, flip on ESPN or hit the gym, you must mentally prepare yourself for life away from civilization. This means you'll need to learn food growing, basic survivalist skills and mentally training yourself to live with literally nothing more than what you choose to bring.  The new paradigm in primitive living is to plan ahead, unlike the days when you had a Swiss Army knife and some clothes. Several items would come in handy should you wish to remain technologically engaged with society: a small or medium solar panel charger, small rainwater collection kit (water stowage), a tent large enough to stand and not feel cramped up in, a means to cook food, at least two weeks worth of easy-to-carry rations and either a consistent financial source, or the skills to barter. Remember––you'll be living outside of a city that is relatively small and without much work.  Niland sits on California Highway 111, which runs near Interstate 10. You can also take the Route 86 South exit off I-10 as 86 joins 111 near Mecca, CA. From Niland, take Main Street until it joins Beal Road; once you pass Salvation Mountain, you're just around the corner from The Slabs.  The area is considered 'deserted territory' by the United States government;however, those living there have set up their own camps, so find space that is a comfortable distance from your nearby neighbor. Many 'courtesy' rules exist at The Slabs, such as allowing perennial RVers the courtesy to have the same spot, although these rules are not enforced since they, essentially, cannot be enforced because nobody owns the land.  If driving, you'll probably want to set up camp near your vehicle to allow others the opportunity to have space; if walking, perhaps 'mark' your territory with a flag, stick sign or something similar. Set up your tent, prepare your bedding, then start mingling with the locals, in order to learn more about The Slabs and their 'community courtesy rules'.  Many kind folks may have rations to give or loan from time to time, yet it's ultimately your responsibility to feed, water and bathe yourself. Ask if different outposts have been created to help people learn about survival. Again, The Slabs are not governed by any specific body, and nobody can do more than to ask you to leave their particular campsite.  If you can hitch a ride with someone to town every couple of weeks to gather rations or water, take the opportunity to do so. If hitchhiking back and forth, you should only carry what you can, and maybe make several trips each week.  Although most individuals are down to earth, rude and disruptive individuals are dealt with, most of the time not very kindly.  

gauge your personal comfort level before heading to slab city.  prepare for a primitive lifestyle.  plan ahead.  find your way there.  once you arrive, find space.  get situated.  learn about surviving.  plan trips to niland sparingly.  keep a level head and kind demeanor while living at the slabs. 

 Setting the movie aside for the moment, think of the riddle in its most basic terms. What do you know, what's your goal, and what are your options? A simpler way to look at the riddle might be: You have two empty water jugs in your hands. One holds 3 gallons of water, the other holds 5 gallons of water. You need to use these two jugs to measure exactly 4 gallons of water. You have an unlimited amount of water to do so.    ; , In order to measure out your 4 gallons, you need to put it somewhere. As John McClane rightly deduces, you couldn't possibly fit it in the 3-gallon jug, which means the right answer must involve getting the right amount of water in the 5-gallon jug.  The solution does not involve bringing in another jug, or eyeballing the water levels perfectly, or finding fractions of jugs. You have two jugs and an unlimited supply of water. How can you use just those things to get to 4 gallons? More specifically, how can you use 3 and 5 to get to 4?   Unlimited water means you can use or pour out as much as you want. You are not able to guess exactly how much water is in the jug unless you fill it all the way up.  Ignore the water and the jugs for a moment if you are still stuck. How can you add or subtract 3's and 5's to get to 4? This is really all you are doing; the numbers just happen to represent gallons. Adding water or dumping it out is really just addition and subtraction.  

simplify the question and your options.  determine where you will keep the 4 gallons of water.  know that, like all good riddles, you have everything you need for a solution.  realize that this is, at heart, a simple math problem.

This is a great option if you have already run away or need to get out of your home immediately.  

report any abuse that you are receiving.  call the national runaway safeline.  find a safe place. 

 The better the guitar, the better the sound. And that means it will be easier and more fun to learn on. That said, it isn't at all necessary to go out and spend tons of money on a nice axe. Don't spend less than $200. There are a lot of poorly made beginner models out there that could just end up leaving you frustrated.   For Rock, an entry level Epiphone (by Gibson) or Squier (by Fender) model guitar is a good idea to start with. If your budget can handle it, Fender and Gibson have famous names on the headstock. They make instruments the way they made them in the 50s, 60s and 70s. For metal, some good brands are B.C. Rich, DBZ, Dean, ESP, Jackson, and Ibanez. If you're old school, Gibson and Fender clones can also be used for metal. Now, you may be asking: what's the difference between a rock guitar and a metal guitar? The most important difference is in the pickups. Heavy metal guitars tend to have "active pickups", while rock guitars usually have "passive pickups". Go ahead and look up the difference. Remember, just because a guitar has passive pickups doesn't mean you cannot play metal with it. Vice versa, just because a guitar has active pickups doesn't mean you can't play rock with it.; , Get something small (no more than about 30 watts, no less than 10) to practice with, and spend no more than 100 dollars on it. It should be a "combo amp". You don't need to pay much heed to this term, but if you're curious, look it up elsewhere. Anyway, you can move to higher-end models later once you are more experienced. Line 6, Crate, Epiphone, Fender, all make decent entry level amps. Fender, Vox, and Marshall make higher-end tube amps, among other companies as well. Read on to find out what the difference between tube and solid-state amps is.   There are two types of amps: Solid-state and Tube. Solid-state amplifiers are much, MUCH cheaper, and are recommended for a beginner. However, some metalcore and metalcore guitarists prefer solid-state amps because they can sound very harsh (doesn't always apply to cheap entry-level amps). Tube amps (also known as "valve" amps, especially in the UK) are frequently used by professional rock musicians, and a large percentage of heavy metal players use tube as well. Unfortunately for the beginner, they much more expensive than solid-state amps. Tube-driven amps are widely considered to sound highly superior to solid-state amps. They are definitely not recommended for a beginner, as they do require maintenance and care must be taken when using them; they are quite fragile and can be costly to repair.  Special note: Some amps use a combination of Tube and Solid-State technology. They are often a good choice for the amateur guitarist who has moved beyond the beginner level. They sound far superior to entry-level Solid-State amps and are a lot cheaper than fully Tube amplifiers. Another special note: "tube" does NOT refer to the shape of the amp.  Get lots and lots of these. You're going to be losing them, I promise. No guitarist can avoid that, so have backups. Get some with a thin to medium thickness and some that are heavier. You will probably find you like one more than the other. Once you have found a preference, buy primarily that type of picks. Jim Dunlop makes great picks of all thickness.  Guitars are nothing without good strings. Investing in these will produce awe-inspiring sound.   D'Addario and Ernie Ball strings are the most commonly used strings for both rock AND heavy metal. It's mostly a matter of personal preference. Keep in mind the string gauge when buying strings. String gauge refers to how thick the strings are. When people refer to string gauges, they usually use the gauge of the high E string (the 1st string). For example, if you buy strings that are .009 gauge, that means that the 1st string gauge is .009 inches (0.0 cm) thick. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Strings#Electric_Guitar for an accurate list of string gauges. The thicker the string gauge, the more bass you can hear and powerful-sounding the strings will be, but it will be more difficult to do string bends. A string bend is when you bend the string so you can change the pitch of the note. The thinner the string gauge, the easier it will be to do string bends, but the strings will sound more like treble. Make sure you try many different kinds so you can figure out what suits you best.  Tablature is a system that uses numbers to represent positions on the fretboard. Remember, the 1st string is the one closest to your feet when you play, and the 6th string is closest to your head.   The long lines represent the strings:  E (1st)--------------------------------------------- B (2nd)--------------------------------------------- G (3rd)--------------------------------------------- D (4th)--------------------------------------------- A (5th)--------------------------------------------- E (6th)---------------------------------------------    , Here is a tablature staff telling you to play a note at the 3rd fret on the 6th string, then a note at the 6th fret on the same string, then a note on the 3rd fret of the 5th string, and finally two notes together - 2nd fret 4th string and the fifth string open (not fretting any note). Whenever notes are shown directly over or under other notes, all of them are played together as a chord.   E (1st)--------------------------------------------- B (2nd)--------------------------------------------- G (3rd)--------------------------------------------- D (4th)-------2------------------------------------- A (5th)-----3-0------------------------------------- E (6th)-3-6-----------------------------------------  , If you don't know how to tune the guitar, buy a tuner. Everybody uses them anyway, because tuning by ear is impossible for a beginner. If you cannot get a tuner, use a pitch pipe or some point of reference to:   Tune the fifth string to A. Then match the sound of the 5th fret on the 6th string to the open A. Match the D string to the 5th fret of the 5th string. Match the G string to the 5th fret of the 4th string. Match the B string to the 4th fret of the 3rd string. Match the high E string to the 5th fret of the 2nd string.  Key, is a big mystery to a lot of beginners. It's going to remain one too - because we aren't going into the swamp of music theory here. Next is this nifty chart which will tell you what fret (position) you can play your pentatonic scale at over any chord and stay in key. If this confuses you, remember that the scale starts on the 6th string, and the first note in the pattern is the root. Even if you skip the 6th string and start playing on the 4th, whatever fret you started on is your position. If you started anywhere on the 5th fret, you're playing in the key of A, etc. Still confused? Have a look at this:  

choose a guitar.  buy an amp.  buy some picks.  buy strings.  learn to understand tablature, often shortened to "tab" or "tabs".  learn from examples.  tune your ax.  learn about key. 

 You may ask your vet, “What type of supplement is best for my older dog?” and “Do you recommend a certain brand?” Your vet should know about your dog’s medical history and be able to help you determine the best supplement for their needs.You should also tell your vet if you are feeding your dog specially formulated dog food, as some dog foods already contain supplements for their health. Your vet may recommend certain supplements based on your dog’s diet as well as their medical history.; , Giving your dog too much of a supplement at a time can lead to health issues. Speak to your vet about the proper dosage for your dog based on their medical history and their medical needs. Always follow the recommended dosage so your dog is not at risk of health issues., Keep an eye on your older dog’s health by scheduling three or six monthly check ups with your vet where you discuss the use of the supplements on your pet. Notice any adverse effects on your dog due to the supplements and let your vet know right away so the type or dosage of the supplement can be adjusted.If you notice your dog is lethargic, has no appetite, or is acting differently than they did before you gave them the supplement, they may be having an adverse reaction to the supplement. Discontinue the use of the supplement and talk to your vet.  Many older dogs suffer from joint issues like arthritis, back issues, and problems with their knees, elbows, and hips. Your dog may start to show signs of joint problems, such as difficulty walking, a limp, or a leaning to one side when they walk. They may also not be as active as they once were and be less inclined to go on long walks or to play for long periods of time.There are certain health supplements that can help to treat joint issues in older dogs. These supplements will contain glucosamine and chondroitin, which have been found to be useful in treating arthritis in humans and animals., If you notice your dog has issues like irritable bowel syndrome, acid reflux, allergies to certain foods, or gas and belly rumbling, they may have poor digestive health. You can address these issues by giving your dog prebiotic and probiotic supplements to make sure their intestines are healthy. These types of supplements can also help your dog’s immune system stay strong and reduce their allergies to certain foods.Many prebiotic and probiotic supplements for dogs have been designed that contain the right type of bacteria normally present in the dog's gut, since this is different than the bugs in a human's gut. These supplements use live cultures to help maintain a microbacterial balance in your dog’s intestines.  Older dogs can have issues like hair loss and dry skin due to old age. You can address these issues in your senior pup by giving them supplements that contain ingredients to increase the amount of moisture in their skin and hair.To address hair loss and dry skin, look for supplements that contain fish oil and fatty acids. These ingredients can help to improve your dog’s coat.  If you notice your older dog is struggling with memory loss, you may try giving them a supplement to address this. Supplements that contain vitamins C and E can help to improve cognitive function in your older dog., Start by reading the label of the supplement. Look for a lot number on the label, as this is an indication the manufacturer has done quality control checks. It will appear on the label as "Lot #:". You should also check for the brand name and a contact number for the manufacturer on the label. You may try calling the contact number to confirm the manufacturer is legitimate.Be wary of claims on the label that sound too good to be true. Labels that advertise the cure for cancer, hip dysplasia and parvovirus are likely not high quality. Avoid products that are labeled as specifically designed to meet the health needs of older dogs, as these types of promises are often marketing ploys.  Check the ingredients list on the label to ensure the ingredients you need for your dog are clearly listed. For example, if you are looking for a supplement to address joint issues, you may look for glucosamine and chondroitin on the list of ingredients.You should also make sure the supplement does not contain ingredients that will be harmful to your dog, such as natural ingredients like garlic as well as certain roots and herbs such as tea tree, wormwood, comfrey, and yucca., The Federal Drug Administration oversees the regulation of animal supplements and reputable pet supplements will often be confirmed tested by the FDA. Keep in mind the FDA does not do constant monitoring of animal supplements and many supplements on the market are not confirmed safe by the FDA.You should also check that the supplement has been independently verified by a third party organization and certified as safe to use. There should be a certification listed on the label of the supplement to confirm this testing.  Get to know the seller of the supplement to confirm it is safe to give to your dog. If you buy the supplement online, do research on the seller to confirm they are legitimate and do not have any negative consumer reports or complaints. You should also discuss your pet’s medical history and their health needs with a seller in store before you buy any supplements.Often, supplements purchased through a vet are less likely to cause issues for your pet. But you should still research the supplement on your own before giving it to your older dog, even if it comes recommended through your vet.  

ask your vet for health supplement recommendations.  get dosage instructions from your vet.  schedule three or six monthly check ups with the vet.  look for a supplement that addresses joint problems in older dogs.  use a supplement to treat your dog’s digestive health.  go for a supplement to prevent hair loss.  use a supplement to address memory issues.  check the label of the supplement.  read the ingredients list.  note if the supplement has been tested by the fda.  research the seller of the supplement.

 Another way you can clip your cat’s nails is to use a regular pair of human nail clippers. These work almost just as well as guillotine clippers. Just make sure that the clippers are sharp enough to cut the nails.You should not use the nail clippers on yourself after using them on your cat. Instead, buy a different pair to use just for your cat.  To clip the claw with human nail clippers, place the clippers perpendicular to the claw. Don’t cut the nail sideways because it will not cut as easily and may end up jagged and splintered. Slide the nail between the two blades and squeeze the clippers., Scissor clippers look like scissors, except they have a curved edge on the blades. Many vets use scissor trimmers.Scissor clippers are generally smaller than guillotine trimmers. This means they may be difficult to use and hold if you have larger hands. Scissor clippers may be better for smaller hands.Because of the way the trimmers are shaped, scissor trimmers are helpful to clip nails that have grown so long they are curling and growing into the toe pad., When using scissor clippers, make sure you place the nail into the blade the correct way. The scissors have a sharp curved edge. Place the bottom of the nail against the blade so you will cut the top and bottom.This prevents splintering and fraying. If you cut the nail side to side with the scissor blades, the nail will split.  Make sure to keep the nail clippers or scissor clippers sharp. Dull clippers can leave a rough, jagged edge. If the clippers leave a jagged edge, use a nail file to smooth out the rough edges. 

use a human nail clipper.  slide the nail between the blades.  try scissor clippers.  place the bottom of the nail against the blade.  use a nail file to smooth rough edges. 

 Begin setting up the event two hours before it starts. This way you won’t be waiting until the last minute, and if you realize you are missing something you can find a solution before the cook off starts.  Once people start arriving at the cook out, you will want to talk with the chefs. Round up everyone who will be cooking and tell them everything they need to know. This could include things like where they should be stationed as well as the start and finish times of the cooking.  You don’t want the guests or the judges to see which chef is making which dish. Have your guests step away from the cooking by having the drinks and snacks in a separate area, where guests can mingle and talk as the chefs are cooking. This way the entries will be anonymous., Signal the start of the cooking by making an announcement or blowing a whistle. Make sure that the chefs have an appropriate amount of time to either cook or warm up their dish. Blow a whistle when the cooking period is over.Walk around during the cooking and check in with chefs to see if they have any questions or if they need more supplies.  If your chefs are all cooking their dishes entirely on site, make sure to give them enough time. How much time it takes may vary depending on the dish they are cooking. Having access to a kitchen is often a good idea if the cooking is happening on site.  

start at least two hours early.  meet with the cooks and run over the plan.  divide the chefs and the rest of the guests.  signal the beginning and the end of the cooking.  give additional time for cooking on site. 

 All land and semi-aquatic turtles need a supply of clean, fresh water in their habitat. By creating a small pond, you provide your turtles with the water they need to swim, bathe, and drink. The size of your pond will depend on the number of turtles you want to have in the enclosure, and the space available. Pools should be large enough for turtles to exercise and move about freely. Take their adult length and multiple that number by 2.5; this is the minimum depth you’ll want the water to be. The length of the pool should be at least five times as large as their adult length. This gives them room to swim around and bask.For ponds with multiple turtles, you need a larger pond. Smaller ponds accumulate waste and cannot be properly cleaned.For land turtles, you want to create a shallow pond that is no deeper than a foot in the middle. The pond should have gently sloping sides so turtles can enter and exit the water easily.  Direct sunlight can cause a small pond to heat to an unsafe temperature, and causes unwanted algae growth.Ideally, you want an area that is has both shade and sun coverage during all times of day. Putting the pond alongside your house or a shed will provide sun coverage for several hours a day as well.  When you’ve decided where you’d like the water feature to go, you can start to dig. It can be whatever shape you’d like, and the depth will depend on the sort of turtle you have. Red-eared sliders do better in deeper ponds, while others prefer shallower water. Research the type of water your turtle species inhabits in the wild to get a good idea of how deep your pond should be.If you intend to have your aquatic turtles hibernate outdoors during the winter, the pool will need at least a foot of water below the ice to hibernate. Check your local area’s weather to see how thick the ice is in local ponds.  You can purchase a pool liner online, from a large retailer, or from an outdoor good store. The liner will keep the water from seeping into the ground, which would become a big muddy mess. You will need to follow the manufacturer’s directions for the pool liner.   A concrete pool will last longer, but is a more complicated process to undergo. If you prefer to use a waterproof tarp, choose tan or canvas colored tarps instead of black. Black tarps absorb the sunlight and can overheat small pools., Using a hose, you can now fill the pond with water.  Logs should be placed around the pond so that some can extend into the water. These help the turtles get in and out of the water, and it also provides them with a place to bask. Logs help to mimic the turtle’s natural habitats, and it also serves a decorative function. 

determine the size of your water feature.  choose a semi-shaded area.  dig a shallow pool.  lay down a pool liner.  fill the pond with water.  place logs around the pond. 

 Contest judges are chosen based on their areas of expertise, but if you have not focused your recent efforts on the genre you've been asked to judge for, refresh your memory before you embark on the task. For instance, if you are an acclaimed romance writer but have spent the last year and a half working on a romance-free crime thriller, spend a few weeks immersing yourself back into the realm of romance before you even start looking over the contest entries.; , Reading too many entries at once will cause you to get tired. As you tire, your ability to judge and perceive things accurately decreases. Once your eyes blur or your mind feels fuzzy, take a break.  Like any judge, you are only human. As a result, you are prone to having fits of good and bad moods. People tend to be a little harsher with others during a bad mood. If possible, review contest entries when you feel your best—or, at the very least, at any time other than when you feel your worst.  Many writing contests have themes, word counts, and other conditions that must be met. Entries that do not fit the theme well or otherwise ignore the contest guidelines must be rejected, no matter how good the story itself might be.   Ask the person putting the contest on for a checklist or set of judging criteria. Smaller contests may leave the decision up to the judges, relying on them to interpret the contest's rules, but many larger contests will have set criteria they want their judges to abide by.  This alone should not be grounds for passing or rejecting someone's entry, but it is a valid place to start. Pieces that you like are probably strong and grammatically sound. Pieces that you do not like may not be, but you should give them a second look before assuming so. Some pieces may not appeal to you on a personal level even though they are strong and fulfill the contest rules.  Oftentimes, it is easier to determine why you dislike something than why you like it. Be objective. If you dislike an entry simply because it is not your "style" or does not appeal to your own sense of taste, do not reject it. If, however, you dislike an entry because it contains numerous grammatically goofs or otherwise exhibits weak writing, turn it down.  Each writer and reader has his or her own rules governing "strength," but there are some standard questions you should ask yourself when reading a contest entry.   Does the entry contain numerous spelling and grammar errors? Does the entry maintain a consistent point of view, or does it jump around without warning? Does the entry rely too heavily on passive tense? Does the entry abuse exclamation points? Is the content unique, or is it filled with one cliché after the next? Does the writer use strong verbs, or are the verbs all accompanied by adverbs?  , Many writing contests require judges to provide critiques for each entry. By starting with praise, you make the recipient of your critique feel more at ease and more likely to take what you say seriously. Even if you struggle to find anything positive about the entry, keep struggling until you find something worth praising. There are plenty of mediocre pieces, but very few that contain nothing worthwhile.  This should go without saying, but the criticism you offer entrants should be for their sake and should not be used as an opportunity to vent your own frustrations. Instead of merely stating that you do not like an entry, explain why the entry seems weak. Provide examples and temper your language. For instance, instead of saying, "This section of the story doesn't work," say, "This section of the story could be stronger if..."  , Being helpful is great, but it has its limits. If you politely suggest two or three changes that you feel very strongly about, the writer may believe your critique and follow through on your suggestions. If you overwhelm the writer with several dozen suggestions, however, he or she may feel too discouraged to benefit from your suggestions or the even bother reading them.  

refresh yourself on the genre.  read entries in small batches.  read entries when you are in a fairly good mood.  review the contest rules.  ask yourself if you like the entry.  sort through the entries you dislike before going through the ones you like.  look at how strong an entry actually is.  start critiques by presenting the entry's strong points.  only offer constructive criticism.  resist the urge to tell the entrant everything you know. 

 Some herbs will stay in sprigs, such as rosemary, parsley or thyme.Bay leaves can be frozen this way.; ,, Place in the freezer and allow to freeze.  Place into bags or suitable freezer containers. Note the date and contents before returning to the freezer. Use within two months.  

select herbs that can be turned into sprigs.  line a baking sheet or tray with parchment paper or kitchen foil.  ,  lay the sprigs across the baking sheet or tray.  remove from the freezer. 

 Keep a sort of diary, or a log, for just a day or two, record the times of day and catch the fluid, measure and record the amount that you urinate, and record each time you have an accidental "leak" of urine each day. Record your fluid intake, also. Your doctor may suggest taking a medication and limiting fluids to no more than 6–8 cups per day from all sources while you’re learning to control your bladder better.; , Average the number of hours that you go between trips to the bathroom during your day?  , Using your average interval of time between needing to urinate, set your interval for beginning your training with one that is 15 minutes longer than the average. So, if you usually had made it for one hour before you need to use the bathroom, now add 15 minutes to make your training interval one hour and 15 minutes.  Each day during you training, empty your bladder first thing in the morning, and then don’t go again until you reach your desired time interval. If the targeted time comes before you feel the need to go, still go anyway to empty your bladder. This includes learning to urinate on a schedule.   If the urge hits too early, remind yourself that your bladder really is not full, and use whatever techniques you can such as to sit or lie down to delay going. The mistaken urge to urinate should taper off after about a minute. Try to wait five minutes or longer before slowly walking to the bathroom.  Try doing pelvic-floor (muscles) exercises (also called Kegels). This by clinching/contracting the muscle that hold back urine flow, muscles which you can find by trying to stop or by stopping flow of urine or passage of gas. Do 6 to 10 contractions in a session, by holding each exercise -- tensing and clinching for about 3 seconds each time and relaxing for about 3 seconds between (holding the Kegels tight feels odd, but do it to get results). Do this once or twice per day. It takes weeks to build some muscle and months to get much stronger.  Once you are successful with your initial interval between going to urinate, try to increase it by 15 minutes. Over several weeks or months, you may find you are able to wait much longer and feel the urge less often.  Do this record after four to eight weeks (1 to 2 months), to see how much you have improved. Compare your initial list/diary to your second diary to note the improvements in urinating (voiding) intervals and voided volumes (amounts)—this process reinforces the bladder training process.  

keep track.  calculate the pattern.  choose a set length of time (interval).  hold back.  strengthen muscles.  increase your time.  do another diary for a couple days.

 The seeds should be in a flat, single layer so that the moisture is evenly distributed.  A plastic container with a tight lid or a large sealable plastic bag works best.  Both warmth and moisture are necessary for germination.  If they have swelled up, they are ready to plant. Some seeds may even have tiny sprouts shooting through.  

place a handful of chili pepper seeds in between sheets of damp paper towels.  seal the seeds and paper towels in a container.  keep the seeds in a warm airing cupboard.  check the seeds after two to five days. 

 Like a loan, a grant is typically a one-time infusion of cash. Unlike a loan, however, you do not have to pay back the money. You can think of a grant as free money. But it can be trickier to qualify for a grant than for a loan. Typically, grants are awarded to businesses that meet special criteria. For example, non-profits, minority- or women-owned businesses and those that perform highly-technical research and development activities often qualify for grant money.  The federal government does not give grants for starting or growing a small business. Some businesses do receive federal grant money if they are involved in something related to a policy initiative. For example, the Small Business Administration (SBA) can sometimes make grants to non-profits for education and training. Also, federal grants sometimes fund medical research, science, education and highly-technical research and development activities.SBA grants for non-profits are announced on grants.gov. Businesses qualifying for specific initiative grants authorized by Congress will be notified. U.S. government’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program and its Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs offer grants for high-tech research and development. You can find out about these grants at SBIR.gov.  State and local governments sometimes offer grants to specific kinds of businesses. For example, some states offer grants for expanding child care facilities. Other initiatives for which you may find state grants include developing energy-efficient technology and creating marketing for tourism. You usually are required to match funds if you receive one of these grants. Also, the grants are typically small, so you may have to seek other forms of financing, such as a loan., Most states offer grants for women- or minority-owned businesses. Also, federal agencies assist women and minorities to find funding to start or expand their businesses. Finally, private funding sources are available for women- and minority-owned businesses.Go to the business section of your state’s website to find available grants. Here you will also find information about any incentives or programs your state has available for your business. Visit the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) at mbda.gov. This agency is run by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and it helps minorities and women to establish and expand their businesses. Here you can research grants and find links to state funding for your business. Private companies that fund grants for women-owned businesses include Huggies, Chase Google, InnovateHER, Fedex, Idea Cafe, the Woman Veteran Entrepreneur Corp (WVEC), Walmart and Zion’s Bank. Private companies that offer grants for minority-owned businesses include Fedex, the National Association for the Self Employed (NASE), Miller Lite and Huggies.

 You will have to bring out a very small version of your cheat sheet for this to work. Type up a cheat sheet on a computer, using the smallest font possible. Most people can't read smaller than an 8 point font. Then, print out the paper and cut out the section that contains the text.Roll the cheat sheet tightly enough that you can slip inside your mechanical pencil. When you're struggling during the exam, pretend that you need to reload your pencil with lead. Slip out your cheat sheet and quickly take a look. Be careful. You will have to glance at the sheet quickly. You should also hold your pencil slightly below your desk as you pretend to reload the lead. You do not want your teacher, or anyone else, to see you are using a cheat sheet.; , You can purchase invisible ink at many department stores, and you can also buy it online. Buy the type of invisible ink that shows up in UV light. You should also buy a keychain flashlight that gives off UV light.Write your cheat sheet down in invisible ink. Bring it to class the day of the exam. Your teacher will probably not worry about a seemingly blank piece of paper out on your desk. Keep your keychain in your hand during the exam, or set it out on your desk. You can pretend you're fiddling with it out of nerves. When the exam begins, subtly shine your flashlight on the piece of paper when you're stumped. It's a good idea to sit in back, to minimize the risk of getting caught.  When you write your cheat sheet, set another piece of paper down below it. Press very hard when you write. The words should be lightly imprinted on the blank sheet of paper. Take it to class on the day of your exam and keep it out on your desk. If your teachers asks, tell her it's scrap paper you intend to use for brainstorming.If you're having trouble reading the words, use your pencil to lightly shade the paper. This should make the words more legible.  Type up your cheat sheet using very small font. Usually, size 8 is the smallest font people can read. Print out the cheat sheet, and cut the section containing text out.Buy a pack of gum. Make sure the kind you purchase contains individually wrapped portions of gum. Remove the foil from one stick of gum. Take your cheat sheet and wrap it round the stick of gum. Re-wrap the gum in foil. During the exam, pretend you're getting a stick of gum. Glance at the cheat sheet as you rewrap the gum and find the answer you need. If you're not allowed to chew gum in class, this method will not work. Check your school's policy before attempting this method.  For a math class, especially an advanced math course, you're usually allowed a calculator. If you have a graphing calculator, there is usually a function you can use to save notes, graphs, and equations. This can work great on a math exam, as a teacher is unlikely to get suspicious of you using a calculator. He or she will assume you're simply typing in calculations.On a graphing calculator, you can usually press a button that says "program" and then press "new." You will then be taken to a screen where you type in formulas. To access this information, press "Edit." Scroll down and find the note that you made with the equations and select it. Every graphing calculator is different. The process on yours may vary. Refer to the instruction's manual for precise directions on adding notes to your calculator.  An audio cheat sheet can work as well as a pen and paper one. You can make a recording of yourself listing basic information. Then, upload that recording to a portable electronic device, like an iPhone or iPod.If you do not already have one, stop by an electronics store and purchase small wireless headphones. You can synch these with your device and place the headphones in prior to your exam. Your teacher is unlikely to see them. You can play your recording on a loop. However, some devices come with a small microphone that takes commands. You may be able to make a noise, like a small cough, to signal your recording to play when you get confused.  This is a simple method, but can be effective. As long as you hold the phone still, and focus, a cheat sheet should be legible on a phone camera. You will probably have to zoom in to read some of the information, but this can be a simple way to sneak your cheat sheet into your exam.Keep in mind, teachers usually do not allow phones out during an exam. A teacher will likely get very suspicious if he or she sees you using your phone. Therefore, sit in the back of class. Be very careful when checking your phone. You can pretend you're getting something from a purse or backpack and glance at your phone. You can also keep your phone under your desk, and subtly glance at it when necessary.  Some iPods allow you to upload notes. You can type your cheat sheet into your iPod and look at the notes when necessary during the exam. A teacher may be less suspicious of an iPod than a smart phone, as a teacher may not think an iPod does anything other than play music.You may be able to keep your iPod on your desk during the exam. You can walk into the exam listening to headphones and then casually set your iPod down on your desk. In the event your teacher asks you to move your iPod, keep it under your desk or balance it on your knee. Quickly glance down at your iPod when necessary during the exam. Sit in the back of the room to avoid being caught checking your iPod.  Every school has a different policy regarding cheating. You want to make sure cheating is worth the risk for you before attempting to do so. Read up on the penalties for cheating in your school's handbook.Some schools may give you a failing grade if you get caught cheating. This can affect your report card grade at the end of the term. You may also be sent to the principal's office. Your parents may be called, leading to trouble at home. If you're in college, you may receive a failing grade for the semester in the event you cheat.  Everyone slips up once in awhile, but cheating can be a real problem if it's habitual. The more often you cheat, the more likely you are to get caught. Cheating can also prevent you from learning valuable information.It's a bad idea to cheat at all. However, if you feel the need to do so, try not to cheat on every test or exam. Avoid cheating unless there were specific, extenuating circumstances that prevented you from studying.  There is no shame in asking for help. If you're cheating because you don't understand a subject, reach out to someone for guidance.You can start seeing a tutor. If your school offers free tutoring programs, make use of those. You can also ask your teacher for help. Most teachers do not want to see their students struggle. Tell your parents and friends if you're struggling with a class. They can help support you as you try to improve your performance.  

place a tiny cheat sheet inside a mechanical pencil.  use invisible ink.  imprint your cheat sheet onto blank paper.  wrap a tiny cheat sheet into a gum wrapper.  upload notes to your calculator.  listen to an audio cheat sheet on wireless headphones.  photograph your cheat sheet with your smart phone.  add notes to an ipod.  learn the consequences of cheating.  do not let cheating become a habit.  ask for help if you're struggling. 

 You should have three tablespoons of fat. Place the pan with the fat back on the stove. Add three tablespoons of flour to the fat and stir.  You should cook the mixture for one to two minutes, stirring constantly. Make sure to scrape any browned bits free from the bottom and sides of the pan.  You will want to have 2 cups of dripping mixture. Measure how much drippings you have and then pour the drippings into a mixing bowl. Add the liquids of your choice so that you have two cups of drippings.   Add pork broth or stock to your drippings for a truly salty, pork flavor. Add sherry or red for a more gourmet gravy. Gravies benefit from a bit of acidity. Wines or sherries add a depth of flavor to the gravy that comes from the addition of the acidity. Some people enjoy making gravy by mixing the drippings with a can of cream of mushroom soup., Stir both mixtures in the pan over medium heat. The gravy should become smooth and thick. Add salt and pepper to taste.   If it is not thick enough for your taste, add another tablespoon of flour.  Enjoy!  ,

 If you expect to breed your dog, take her to the vet beforehand.If your dog becomes pregnant unexpectedly, take her as soon as you become aware of it.   If you plan to breed your dog, it’s recommended that you wait until she’s at least 24 months old, which will allow the dog to fully mature so any medical problems that may affect a pregnancy will become apparent. Small dog breeds may have genetic conditions that are important to be aware of before breeding, including dental problems, dislocating patellas, hip dysplasia, spine problems, allergies, heart conditions, and/or behavioral problems. If your dog has these problems, do not breed her. Make sure that your dog is up to date on vaccines. Her antibodies will be passed on to the puppies through her milk and will help protect the puppies from getting sick. Make sure that your dog is on a deworming program. Roundworms, hookworms, heartworms and others can be passed from a mother to her puppies.; , Your vet can offer recommendations as to the best food for her during her pregnancy. If your pregnant dog is not obese, your vet may recommend feeding her puppy food in the latter weeks of her pregnancy.   The higher calories in puppy food will help the mother pass on additional nutrition to her growing puppies. Avoid supplements such as calcium unless your veterinarian prescribes them. Milk fever, or eclampsia, is common for small breed dogs a few weeks after giving birth, and it’s more likely to occur with over supplementation of calcium during pregnancy.  The average gestation period for a dog is between 58 and 68 days. Calculate the dog's expected due date based on the date of conception, so that you'll be prepared when the time for labor comes.   Your pregnant chihuahua is likely to display nesting behaviors and may withdraw from people in the final weeks of her pregnancy. This is normal.  At 45 days of pregnancy, the vet will be able to count the number of puppies in the litter using x-rays.   Since a Chihuahua is a small breed dog, 3 or 4 puppies in a litter is plenty. However, if only one or two are seen, that may pose problems at the time of birth. Fewer puppies mean the puppies will be larger and may be too big to pass through the birth canal naturally, so a planned C-section would be best. Though a planned C-section will be more costly, it will still be cheaper than an emergency C-section, so plan ahead.  About a week before your dog is due to begin labor, find a quiet area where your chihuahua will be able to give birth in peace. A cozy box or dry paddling pool in a calm and quiet area should do the trick; add old towels or blankets for comfort, and make sure they're clean.  As soon as you know your dog’s pregnant, whether it was planned or not, begin arranging for homes for the puppies.   If you aren’t able to find homes for all of the puppies, be prepared to keep them yourself until you can find them a home. Thousands of dogs end up in over-crowded shelters because irresponsible owners breed their dogs without providing homes for the puppies. Don’t be part of the problem. Prepare to live with puppies for a minimum of 8 weeks before they leave your house for new homes. In certain states like California, it’s illegal to adopt out a puppy younger than 8 weeks of age. To ensure the puppies go to good homes, have an application process and ask questions of the interested parties. It’s also recommended that you charge a modest amount for each puppy to ensure the interested parties are serious about and committed to adopting the puppy.  Newborn puppies will need to be fed every 2-4 hours around the clock, and if a puppy has trouble nursing, you want to have formula on hand to feed it.   You can buy puppy formula at most pet supply stores.  To protect the mother and her puppies from contracting illness or disease like canine herpes, confine her away from all other dogs in the three weeks leading up to her expected delivery date.It’s also highly advisable to keep the mother away from other dogs for three weeks following the delivery.  When the time comes, help your chihuahua through their labor. You can find a detailed guide specifically on labour at How to Help Your Chihuahua During Labor.  Your dog is able to conceive as soon as she enters her first heat cycle, which can be as young as 4 to 7 months old.When your dog is in heat, she will attract male dogs and may even actively seek them out. Other dogs can detect the scent of a female dog in heat from miles away; thus it’s extremely important that you keep very close watch on a dog in heat and confine her indoors at all times to avoid unwanted pregnancy. A Chihuahua may conceive even if you think you intervened before copulation was completed. A Chihuahua can be impregnated by a much larger dog (or dogs), in which case pregnancy and labor can become increasingly risky. Avoid this situation as far as possible. Ideally, the female should be larger than the impregnating male. If your dog is impregnated by a larger dog, seek your veterinarian’s advice.  A dog will begin to show key symptoms that can help you determine if she’s likely pregnant, including:Lethargy Reduced appetite or vomiting Rapidly enlarging stomach that feels firm (the stomach will be visibly swollen by 15-30 days into the pregnancy) Nipples will enlarge and protrude Note that while some reduced appetite and/or nausea is normal, it should resolve itself within about a week. If it lasts longer than that or occurs along with listlessness, it could be a sign of something more serious and you should bring your dog to the vet., Unless directly instructed by your vet, you should not give your dog medications unsafe for pregnancy, and you shouldn’t have her vaccinated.Ideally, your dog should have been vaccinated before she became pregnant. But if not, don’t vaccinate her while pregnant, as some vaccines can be harmful to developing fetuses. If using flea control, be sure to use a product that’s safe for use on pregnant dogs.  

take your dog to the veterinarian before she becomes pregnant.  make sure your dog is getting the right kind of nutrition.  prepare for the due date.  have your veterinarian take x-rays of the puppies.  set up a nesting area.  arrange for homes for the puppies.  buy puppy formula ahead of time.  isolate the mother three weeks before expected delivery.  prepare for the actual delivery.  know when your dog is able to conceive.  know the signs of pregnancy.  be careful of giving your pregnant dog medication or vaccines. 

 Don't go into school one day with Doc-Martens and think you're cool. You really should invest in this kind of thing. It is recommended that you stock up on skinny jeans. You should also make sure to own a number of graphic tees that says stupid stuff. You can also make your own t-shirts, it's easy. Doc-Martens are good with certain outfits but you should own some Vans and Converse, too! Avoid bright colored jeans, that's Scence, not punk princess. Be creative. Own a few band tees as well. You don't have to wear black, but the traditional punk princess is always spotted dressed in black.  To be a punk princess, you need to go way back. The bands that you listen to shouldn't be just new or popular ones. Listen to Joan Jett and the Blackhearts. Write Bad Reputation Nation on your notebook. A few bands you should know are: The Rolling Stones, who are rock and very popular, The Beatles, who are pop and arguably the most popular pop group ever, Kiss, The Ramones, The Sex Pistols, The Clash, and of course the rock band Aerosmith. You should know these bands as well as the new ones that are popular today., If you don't think something is right, don't stick with it. Don't yell at your teacher and slap her, then walk out the classroom. You should stand up for your rights, that's all., There are a wide range of hairstyles you should get. Mohawks are good for anyone. You can get layers and just poof your hair. However, it shouldn't be too poofy, because then you'll look like a Scene kid. Check out the mullet hairstyle for girls. Kirsten Stewart's or any of Toyah Willcox's styles from the 80s are perfect examples.  It is recommended that if you're pale, just stick with black eyeliner and black eyeshadow. Go bolder and maybe try some orange or something on your eye lids if you wish., You may be a punk princess in training, but you may not perfect your punk princess rebel attitude for a few years. The rebel attitude takes time. Still be nice, but sort of rebellious at the same time., Your grades shouldn't change. Don't start letting your grades slip because that's what you think "punks do". Punks are smart, but again, they are rebellious. They never give in too easily, but they are also less stubborn., Take regular baths, keep your face clean, and of course, wear deodorant., For the modern punk princess look, these are important., Don't care what anyone thinks. It's all about you.

 Realize that casino poker can be "no limit" (NL) and have extreme risks. Also, you have to chip-in/pay to play, and the price goes up as the number of players dwindle in the tournament. But "friendly" poker can have the expected outcome go wrong and cause you to lose your stack, (to say nothing of ruining your credit, when borrowing to pay gambling debts) and possibly lose face/your-reputation! By betting money into a pot that you know you're not likely to win, you're taking big risks (and, if you fold your bet/wagered money stays in the pot). On the other hand, sometimes opportunity strikes and looks so winnable, and the other players so "bluffable", that it seems worth such risk. Have your limits, strategy and backdoor. It is worth understanding from the outset that bluffing is a lot less common than shown in movies; in most cases especially with a large table of players, you do need to have good cards because someone at the table will often want to play to a final showdown since someone will have good cards in that large pool of players.   In tournaments avoid bluffing someone with a shorter stack who will be looking to get more money by betting strongly/and even going all in -- and, also, you avoid deeper stacks that can afford to "look you up" (call your bet/bluff). Medium stacks are the ideal target because they are less desperate, and more likely to play conservatively and fold when you bluff strongly; so, you win more often there.  Bluff not only when it's worth doing so, but also when the stakes are high; bluffing works well in high stakes when you have a middle or better stack, and the pressure's on all the shorter stacks to catch up to the leaders or fizzle, and they may go for bust with a weak hand, hoping to bluff-out anyone with a medium or bigger stack! Talented poker players acquire their skill from thousands upon thousands of hands of experience; such as playing for practice online. If you continue to play poker with discipline and an open mind, your chances of bluffing successfully should increase consistently. A good bluffer has a constant attitude, either a fun personality or a never changing poker-face, and "makes the attitude seem real". The successful bluff is one where nobody knows you bluff, because all the opponents fold/give-up before the last chance to bet, and you win the pot by default. If there is a showdown (where you must show your cards), you will be shown-up as a bluffer, if you are seen betting big with a weak or trash hand. You normally only want to get into a showdown when you have pretty good cards, except getting caught once may be okay; so, be ready to use your backdoor (so fold), before the showdown when you have a weak/or trash hand!; , "Tells" are important - they're the analyzing side of playing poker. Not only does a good knowledge of tells tell when someone else is bluffing, but knowing common signs of bluffing will help you to try to avoid your own unconscious giveaway signs. And listen to other's advice about when they say that they think you're bluffing; being consciously aware of your subconscious tells can be used to your advantage by acting "bluff" tells when you want someone to think you're bluffing, but you actually have a great hand!   Watch how chips are put down. They can be placed down gently, counted down, banged down, slid forward, etc. If a player bets his chips very strong and far away from himself, it can mean that subconsciously their chips are going away from them, like they might be bluffing. On the other hand, a person betting closer to themselves can subconsciously mean that the money is expected to be coming back to them. Watch the body language. Look for eye twitches, lip movements, scratching, flaring nostrils, holding of breath, and hand movements (such as covering parts of the face, differently than usual). All of these things can indicate bluffing. Shaking is considered to be a sign of strength, expecting to win a pot. When your opponent acts really strong they are likely weak/and bluffing. Staring you down whilst you act, splashing the pot, or faking a big smile when a certain card hits are all common signs of bluffing. Watch other players to learn the tells when they're bluffing. Learn good tricks from those who bluff well.  Keen instincts and sharp intellect must be combined with the ability to show no inconsistent emotion, or reveal nothing other than casual, fun involvement in the game. Look carefully at the corner of your two hold cards slowly/casually, keeping them face down, where only you can possibly see. Don't spill any information; so, keep your face "deadpan," and wear shades to have the eyes as expressionless as stone and restrain blinking and shifting nervously when you see your cards -- and when the community cards are dealt each time. Avoid expressing approval or disapproval as if seeing good/bad cards (act the same way all the time as part of your poker face) - this is crucial if you're playing face to face.   Consider using props/concealment. Cowboys in the Wild West used to use their hats to cover their faces. In the age of televised poker, novelty props such as crazy hats, spooky glasses, and fancy wear can turn a player's chosen image into a big business affiliated product. A beard, neck scarf, hoodie and sunglasses can work to cover your face, and neck. Not only the face but the neck can show tension or relaxing, a change in the pattern of your breathing or blushing/flushing.  If you bet pre-flop, you may seem to represent a pair or other good cards in your hold, and get players to commit or fold their hold cards. Then you can raise on the flop to press those who are still left to bet/commit or fold. If you are playing too loosely, trying to look strong, you can seem false/like you are bluffing. So, don't bet pre-flop very often or you won't look real.  Your chances of successfully bluffing are greater with fewer opponents because you have fewer people to drive out of the pot. Bluffing one or two players is more profitable/workable than bluffing-out three or more players.  Do not bet too much, and don't raise an already large bet. If you think someone else probably has a great hand, fold, and play another hand later, as a path of escape/concealment.  Making a reasonable bet, as it goes around the table for everyone to either bet or fold, makes you seem real. Be seen holding good cards at showdown, win or lose, or occasionally turnover your good cards when people suggest they think that you win by bluffing. So, build a reputation of consistently betting good hands to make your opponents believe that you probably have another pretty good hand when you are betting moderately. So, they think that you are logically trying to get as many chips into the pot, out of their stacks as you can. It takes guts to carry out the consistent pattern to set up a few good bluffs, because you could be up against a better hand, but if it's done right it can work pretty often, with luck, and if you stay alert enough to know when to fold to save your stack.  This one must be powerful and intimidating. When the opponent checks, and then it comes to you, you can place a large bet to get the opponent to call or fold. If a player bets in front of you, there are two things you can do. If s/he bets small, your making a significantly larger bet might push him/her to fold. However, if the opponent makes a large, bluff-like bet, your best chance to bluff would be to call (less risk) -- or go all in, especially if you have a lot more chips than the other player. Consider, it is better to push all-in by betting than by calling, since you want to look strong to have more impact. The best feeling in poker is deciding someone is bluffing and taking down a large pot with a bluff of your own, causing the first bluffer to fold, and no one ever knows whether either or both of you were bluffing.   The turn card is also very important. If you bet big on the turn when you've been betting moderately earlier, players can be more intimidated. If you think you've actually won the hand on the turn card, you may even want to just check, and then bet like crazy on the river. People are more likely to make/call a big bet, if you checked before, thinking you might be weak/bluffing. This works even better, if you've been (accidentally?) caught bluffing earlier.  Though, doing nothing special is likely to win a hand when everything is going right. Still, experienced players, can win pretty often when nothing is going right by representing (as if) having the goods, by playing, but not by lying. If you are seen as being a consistent liar, people will ignore your bluff, and few (or no one) will be scared by your bluff. Play "tight"/seeming real, conservative (not loose) most often, then go strong, convincingly at the opportune moment; so your opponent gets "that sick, losing feeling" -- believing you have another good hand, fearing and avoiding a big risk, and so they fold (that's how a bluff can work). No matter how much advice you've followed from this article, a sudden river (5th Street) bet will not tell a cohesive story on its own, to lead people to believe the suggestion you make.   For example: Let's say you raise pre-flop, and then bet hard again on a flop of 9-3-J. Your opponent might have thought you were representing a pocket pair (a pair in your hold) by the pre-flop bet -- and now think you probably have a pair of 9s or Jacks on the flop because you bet. But if instead, the turn brings a 3 and you bet again, your opponent could be scared that you are on trip 3s, if you hadn't raised pre-flop, only to turn around and bet hard on 3s, a "bottom pair," on the flop. A savvy opponent, with a made hand, could simply call your bets/bluff and rake in the pot. Pay attention to the sequence of cards (to represent a possible straight), suite/color (a possible flush) on the flop and watch how the betting unfolds. Try to represent having a certain/specific hand by having an attitude, good reputation, and being consistent with your betting pattern. Make a bluff when cards are dealt that will possibly have weakened your opponents hand. If your opponent has called on a J-7-2 flop and the turn brings a 7, then this is not a good time to bluff as any pair your opponent may hold will still be as strong as before but he probably doesn't have trip 7s. If instead of 7 the turn comes down a K, then it is not looking so good now because some one (maybe you) may have paired Ks on the flop; so they are more likely to fold Js or 7s, if you betted/bluffed as if you may now have a pair of Kings. Then if they fold, you take the pot without a showdown. But, if instead of K the turn were any lower number card, then their possible pair of J or 7 would still be looking pretty good to your opponent. And, if you bet after seeing a weak turn card, they won't likely fold, because of your playing on the weak turn card is not scary to anyone. You need to decide to fold, if your opponent raised here or for sure on the River, if you're cards are a weak or trash hand, to avoid being caught.  After the river bets (and, oops!, opponentdidn't fold), don't show your "iffy" cards. Say, "Let's see your winning cards," and when the winner turns over his cards, just chirp, "You win!" If he insists to see your hand, "No, let's see you hand; I think you got it."; you won't need to prove anything about your story.  You insist, "You got it. You win" They win by default, anyway, if you "discard the cards face-down" without showing how relatively weak or strong you were. Just, chuckle, and leave them guessing, trying to never show a shaky hand... But, if you had a nice hand/not good enough. You could after moderate resistance, finally, show them, "See, it was good, okay?" That's fun and proves you are betting strong, maybe.  

understand the stakes.  understand how to read the tells.  develop the proverbial poker face.  begin bluffing.  count how many players are betting in the hand.  bet, or raise someone else's bet, in the first round of betting, before the flop (the first 3 community cards).  consider checking when good cards hit you, if checking is available, either on the flop or on the turn to act casually (checking is not available when someone has a bet that you must call/raise or fold/abandon the pot).  remember that the bet following/on the river (the 5th community card) is the most important.  suggest a pattern, playing a clean mind game/like a story with your bets, calls/raises.  keep bluffing under your hat: maintain/conceal the bluff on a weak hand. 

 Cymrics are playful cats that love engaging toys. Therefore, entertain your cat with ping-pong balls, food puzzles, and cardboard boxes to jump in. Food puzzles are a great choice because they provide the mental stimulation that a Cymric cat needs.Make sure the toys you purchase are safe and cat-friendly.  Cymrics love to play fetch; this is a personality trait that they are known for. You can also teach it other tricks like sit, come, shake and spin. However, only teach your cat one trick at a time in 10 to 15 minute sessions.When teaching your Cymric tricks, make sure to use reward-based techniques like treats and praise. Never use negative punishment to train your cat.  The Cymric’s well-developed hindquarters make jumping one of its favorite things to do. Therefore, purchase cat trees and posts for your Cymric cat to jump and perch on.Cat trees and posts will also deter your Cymric cat from jumping on higher, more dangerous pieces of furniture in and around your house.  By character, Cymrics are children-friendly and animal-friendly (including dogs) cats. Therefore, starting at a young age, expose your Cymric cat to other adults, cats, children, and puppies.If you do not have children, a puppy, or another cat, then invite friends who do over to play with your cat.  Cymrics are very loyal, people-oriented cats that love to spend quality time with their owners. Therefore, make sure to provide your cat with attention and affection daily. Do this by playing with it, teaching it tricks, or brushing and petting it for 30 minutes at least once or twice a day. 

supply it with a variety of toys.  teach it tricks.  provide it with high places to perch on.  expose it to a variety of situations.  provide attention and affection. 

 This is the very first step. At this early stage, don't be too concerned about the story. Your goal here is to generate as many fresh ideas as you can. Don't worry too much about the quality of the ideas. An idea that appears good now may turn out to be a really bad idea later on. Write your ideas down so that you can go back and pick one to write on later.; , For content to be interesting, you need to pick a topic that is fresh. Everyone likes novelty. It's easier to create interesting content when you are writing about a cool mobile gadget that is about to be launched in the near future. You can, of course, with good writing skills, turn a mundane topic into something interesting. But that requires more effort and skill. Imagine having to write about doing the dishes. How interesting do you think your article will be?  , Too many writers try to impress their readers. As a result, they use flowery words or jargon that very few people can understand. Having a wide vocabulary is great. But misusing that range is never a good idea. Always strive to communicate your ideas clearly. This applies to all forms of writing - press releases, blogs, and even novels.  If you want your writing to come to life, be as descriptive as you can. Being descriptive is especially useful for fiction writers. Having all those little details simply allow the reader to paint a more vivid image in his or her mind.  Be clear about your target audience. Who are you writing for? If your writing is meant for the general public, then make it easy for everyone to understand. Use short sentences and simple words. If you are promoting your corporate website using a press release, write in a formal style.  Nobody likes to read stale content. If you are having difficulty having original ideas, start by stating your own opinions.  There are often opportunities for a writer to let the reader get a sense of who you are. Let your writing reflect your personality.  If you are making an argument in your article, try to back up your argument with facts and figures. Concrete statistics can help bring credibility to your writing.  If you are borrowing content or ideas from an external source, be sure to cite all sources at the end of the article. It's about respecting the rights of other writers. Being respectful makes the Internet a much nicer space for everyone.  

generate fresh ideas.  pick a fresh idea to write about.  write to communicate, not to impress.  be descriptive.  pick the right tone and writing style.  be creative and original.  let your personality shine.  don't forget the facts and figures.  quote and cite reference sources. 

 This is the most common type of tank for bearded dragons. Glass aquariums are inexpensive and easy to find at local pet stores or on local market sites like Craigslist. The only downsides are that they are heavy and not well insulated. A heavy tank can be difficult to move and once it’s set up with the dragon inside, you’ll not be inclined to move it. And while bearded dragons might not mind the lack of insulation, some owners complain that a lower temperature dulls the reptile’s color., Melamine cages are made of melamine board, a kind of wood coated with a laminate finish. You can build a melamine cage yourself or buy one at your local pet store.These types of cages replicate the zoo-going experience. Unfortunately, this means the lizard can only be seen from one side of the enclosure.   You can leave the boards within the cage plain white to reflect light, or choose to affix an artificial rock surface to the back and side of the cage to replicate a more natural environment.  A PVC cage is made of a kind of plastic and therefore much easier to move than a melamine cage. They are, unfortunately, more expensive than melamine, but many people find that the PVC plastic looks better than the melamine board cage., There are several high-end companies that make quality cages for reptiles. These cages are professional-grade and made of one molded piece of plastic. They are quite expensive but many breeders favor them because they are conveniently stackable.Chemically resistant, easy to clean, and shipped with a built-in heat lamp, professional cages are the best cages available.  Do not use solid lids of plastic or glass. These can limit airflow in your dragon’s tank.Bearded dragons come from very dry, arid regions in Australia where there is little humidity. A firmly closed lid will lead to an unhealthy increase in humidity.  Baby dragons, for instance, need a 20 gallon tank. Larger (10-16 inch) dragons will need a tank of at least 40 gallons.   It doesn’t hurt to get a tank larger than the minimums listed above. Doing so will make your dragon happy. It’s a good idea to get the largest tank you expect you’ll need, rather than working up through progressively larger tanks. For instance, instead of starting with a small 20 gallon tank and then buying larger 40, 50, or 75 gallon tanks as your dragon grows, just spring for the 75 or 120 gallon tank and let your dragon grow into it.  Your light needs to be in a location where the lizard can come within six to eight inches of it. If your light is located in an overhead position more than six to eight inches from the floor of the tank, provide a rock or branch which your lizard can climb to move closer to the light.  Over time, UVA/UVB lights become less effective. Even if your bulbs seem to be operating in good condition, change them every six months in order to keep your lizard healthy., This basking light should be a bright white and can be bought either at local hardware stores or from a pet store. Be sure you provide room for this light in addition to the full-spectrum light (which usually runs the whole length of the cage) when setting up your bearded dragon’s tank.   Install the basking light at one end of the tank. This way, the dragon will have a warm side and a cool side of the tank. Alternatives to the basking bulb include a ceramic heater or a household bulb that puts out a lot of heat (any old-style rounded bulb will do).  Install the other at the opposite end where the temperature should be cooler. This way you can ensure that the basking lamp is doing its job. If you see that the temperature is uniform throughout the tank, replace your basking bulb.   You could also install a humidity gauge to ensure that humid air is not accumulating in the tank. If your cage is small, you might be okay to install just one thermometer gauge.Use small, round thermometer gauges available at your local pet store. They attach easily to the inside of the tank and are specially designed for reptile habitats. Additionally, invest in an infrared temperature gun or a digital thermometer with a probe end. Use it to monitor the temperature in your tank. Do not use traditional “stick” style thermometers; they are notoriously inaccurate., The warm side of the tank should be at about 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The cooler side should be at about 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Be careful at night. The tank should never be below 70-75 degrees Fahrenheit. Check your tank at night; it can be hard to keep nighttime temperatures in the acceptable range.If you’re having trouble keeping the tank warm at night, invest in an under tank heater (UTH). You can also adjust the tank temperature by moving the basking light closer to or further from the tank.  Reptile carpet is good for dragons of any age, but is the best choice for juveniles (dragons less than six inches long).Small bearded dragons might accidentally ingest more sand than their tiny lungs and stomachs can handle.   For close substitutes, you could also use AstroTurf or indoor/outdoor carpet., Tile is easy to clean up and will easily outlast your bearded dragon. Regular slate or ceramic tile makes a good substrate for your dragon. It is nontoxic, inedible, and sturdy. You can get tiles at your local hardware store., These materials are cheap and easy to replace. However, they do have to be replaced daily when they get wet or yucky. If you do not, your dragon might get sick and the tank will become uncomfortably humid.If your dragon gets ill, you can lay newspaper and/or paper towel down until they are better. Doing so makes cleanup easy and is an important step in preventing infected fecal matter or vomit from re-infecting your sick dragon. Newspaper and/or paper towel are also useful when treating a dragon with parasites., However, sand is messy and gets everywhere, including in the lizard’s food and water. Because sand is so easily ingested by lizards, it is a leading cause of impaction, eye abscesses, and other ailments. Avoid substrates like sand, gravel, wood shavings, walnut shells, and other particulate substrate.Besides the health risks sand poses for your bearded dragon, it is impractical in that it is difficult to clean.  A basking platform allows your dragon to get closer to the basking light in his or her cage. While you can buy a sturdy (if artificial-looking) structure, you might prefer to introduce a long branch or a rock over which your dragon can climb., Your dragon will also use the hide for brumation, the reptile equivalent of hibernation. And, like humans, sometimes bearded dragons just get shy and want some privacy away from prying eyes.   Place the hide beneath the basking lamp to keep it warm inside. If your dragon isn’t using its hide, try to move the location, or try a different type of hide., Give your tank a natural look by adding things like plastic cacti or flowers.You could also use real plants like Dracaena, Ficus benjamina, and hibiscus. If you do choose to use live plants, ensure they are nontoxic and have not been treated with biocides. Wash them thoroughly with a water spray and water them for a few weeks before introducing them into the tank with your bearded dragon.   Artificial plants are the best choice since you’ll never have to worry about them having any pesticides or bugs on them. Plus, you won’t have to water them. 

choose a glass aquarium.  choose a melamine cage.  choose a pvc cage.  choose a professional cage.  ensure your tank has an appropriate lid.  ensure your dragon has enough room.the size of your tank depends on how large your dragon is.the larger your dragon, the bigger the cage it will need.  install a full-spectrum light in your dragon’s tank.a full-spectrum light emits regular visible light that helps us see, plus other ranges in the ultraviolet spectrum (uva and uvb) which dragons need to stay healthy.  change your uva/uvb bulbs frequently.  include a basking light in your dragon’s cage.in addition to the full-spectrum light, you will need to provide a source of hot light.  install two temperature gauges in the tank.install one temperature gauge at the hot end near the basking bulb.  identify and maintain your target temperatures.  install reptile carpet.  install tile.  drop some paper towel or newspaper in the tank.  avoid loose or particulate substrate.sand is often recommended as the ideal substrate.  add a basking platform.  add a hide.a hide (or hide box) is a little hut or house into which your bearded dragon can crawl for extra warmth.  add some naturalistic elements. 

 Alleviating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms is one of the primary reasons people take acacia fiber. Take the suggested amount of fiber before meals to alleviate IBS symptoms, especially if you are about to eat a meal high in insoluble fiber or fat.If you suffer from IBS, make sure to talk with your doctor about the ways acacia fiber can alleviate your symptoms.  If you suffer from bloating, gas and/or cramps, then taking acacia fiber daily may alleviate these symptoms. Before a meal, drink a solution of acacia fiber and water. Or, add it to your meal by mixing it in with your food., Because it is a fiber, consuming acacia fiber with your meal can help you feel full for a longer amount of time. To curb your cravings for unhealthy snacks in between meals, supplement your meals with the suggested amount of acacia fiber.Once acacia fiber is in your stomach, it absorbs water and turns into a gel-like substance. This gel-like substance slows digestion, helping you feel fuller for a longer period.  

alleviate ibs symptoms.  soothe your sensitive stomach.  curb your cravings.

 If you live in one of these areas, you will inherently be at higher risk; however, if you live elsewhere and can avoid traveling to these places, you will diminish your risk and hopefully avoid contracting MERS.   Cases have also been reported in the following countries (in people who traveled to high risk areas in the Middle East): Algeria, Austria, Thailand, South Korea, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Turkey, Hong Kong, Italy, Malaysia, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Tunisia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. If you are in a high-risk area in the Middle East, avoid contact with camels as they may also transmit the disease (transmission from camels to humans is possible).This includes avoiding eating camel meat, or consuming camel urine (which is considered a medicinal practice in certain areas of the world). There are currently no travel restrictions to Middle Eastern countries where MERS is more prevalent; however, if you do travel there, practicing good hygiene and reporting any possible symptoms of MERS to a physician is important.; , This is a general, hygienic precaution that should especially be followed by anyone visiting farms, markets, barns, or places where animals are present. Wash your hands before and after touching animals and do not touch any sick animals.Wash your hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 – 30 seconds. Be sure to scrub the full surface area of your hand, including between your fingers. If warm water and soap are not readily available for you during the day, another option is to carry an alcohol-based sanitizer in your pocket or in your purse. While hand washing should always be practiced, it is important to note that MERS is spread by a respiratory droplet, as from someone coughing. It is highly unlikely you would catch MERS from touching a contaminated object, but rather from being in direct contact with fluids from an infected person., If you have been in contact with a sick person who coughed or sneezed on you and got a droplet on your hand, then putting your hands to your face can transfers the germs and increases your chances of catching the infection.  

be careful traveling to areas where mers is prevalent.countries that have had higher rates of mers include jordan, oman, saudi arabia, kuwait, yemen, lebanon, qatar, the united arab emirates, and iran.  wash your hands regularly.  refrain from touching your face.one of the fastest way to pick up a bug and catch a virus (such as mers) is to touch your hands to your face — including your eyes, your nose, and/or your mouth — after it has been in contact with the bodily fluids of a sick person.

 You should only use food grade plastic buckets or glass carboys as your fermentation vessel. Make sure that the lid is food grade as well. A 7.5 gallon (28 L) vessel will allow for 5.5 to 6 gallon (21 to 23 L) batches. Keep in mind that you may occasionally need to stir the batch, so containers such as buckets are often ideal., You need about 1.5 to 2 gallons (5.7 to 7.6 L) worth of space in a 7.5 gallon (28 L) vessel. This allows room for the foam and gases that form during fermentation. If you don’t leave enough room, the pressure can build and pop the lid on the vessel, leading to contamination., You need to make a hole in the lid that is the right size for a rubber grommet and airlock. Push the grommet into the hole. Then fit the airlock into the top of the grommet. Install a rubber gasket around the lip of the lid to form an airtight seal between the lid and the container., The fermentation vessel (and rubber stopper for glass vessels or lid for a plastic bucket), airlock, and a large spoon should be cleaned and sanitized. Fill the fermentation vessel to the brim with a sanitizer, such as iodophor, that is made for brewing and winemaking. All these items are available at homebrewing and wine-making shops. 

use materials safe for consumption.  leave extra room.  prepare the lid.  clean and/or sanitize the equipment. 

   A crown roast can be made from pork, lamb or veal. Beef loin is too large to properly form into a crown roast. You need to purchase the loin with the ribs still intact. In order to properly tie the crown you'll need to purchase 2 strips of the bone-in loin. Each strip should have at least 4 bones for it to form the crown properly.; ,   Lay the strip of loin horizontally on a cutting board in front of you. With a sharp knife, carefully make a cut from one end of the loin to the other, perpendicular to the bones, about 1 1/2 inches (3.5 cm) from the top of the bone. Lay the second strip of loin on the cutting board and make a similar cut. Remove the meat from between the cut you just made and the top of the bone. Use a small knife to carefully cut away this meat; you can save it for another use. Cut away enough meat to expose the bones. Do this for both strips of loin.    Frenching is the process of removing the meat from between each bone. Using a thin bladed knife or boning knife cut away the meat from between each bone. Cut away enough meat so that 1 1/2 inches (3.5 cm) of bone is exposed. Clean away any fat and meat from each bone until they're as close to bare bone as you can manage.    Lay the strips of loin on the cutting board horizontally in front of you, bone side up and with the bones facing away from you. With a small knife, make a shallow incision through the meat halfway between each bone. Your cuts should extend from the bottom of the meat up between each bone to the top of the meat.    Stand the strips up with the bones facing upward and the meatiest portion of the meat facing inward. Shape the 2 strips into a circle. With a long length of string, tie the meat together in a circle. One string should tie the roast across midway up the outward facing bones, and another string should tie below the bones in the meaty portion of the strips. ,   Roast the crown roast in a 350 degree F (180 degree C) oven for 20 to 25 minutes per lb. or until the meat has reached an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) in the meatiest portion.    Crown roasts have traditionally been stuffed prior to roasting. It is, however, easier to make the stuffing and bake it separately then spoon the stuffing into the center of the cooked crown. If the roast were stuffed and then roasted, you would have to cook the roast to a much higher internal temperature to ensure that the stuffing is cooked. This would result in overcooked meat.    Remove the string from the roast and place the cooked roast on a serving platter. Spoon the cooked stuffing into the center of the roast and serve.  

purchase the meat.  trim the meat.  french the bones.  cut the meat.  tie the roast.  liberally season the roast with salt and pepper.  ,  roast the meat.  make the stuffing.  serve the roast. 

 Choose a primary weapon that fits your playing style. If you like having mobility go for an SMG (Sub Machine Gun); if you like camping try a Sniper Rifle; if you're looking to overpower your opponent pick an LMG (Light Machine Gun) or a Shotgun; if you want a balanced weapon equip an Assault Rifle.; , Pick an attachment that will benefit you in combat. The Grenade Launcher, as well as Masterkey, is like having an extra weapon. Scopes are great for getting long range target and overall increase your accuracy. There are plenty of scopes to choose from, so pick the one that you like best.  It's a good idea to pick a secondary weapon that will compliment your primary weapon. For example if you are using a long range sniper rifle you might want to choose a short range pistol or the Ballistic Knife. Launchers are helpful in taking out those pesky spy planes and attack helicopters as well as blowing the opposing team to bits.  All three of the lethal grenades have their pros and cons. Frag grenades can be bounced off of walls; Semtex grenades will stick to enemies and walls; the Tomahawk is an instant kill and can be picked up and thrown again after you use it.  Depending on your preference you can equip a number of different tactical grenades. Willy Pete grenades will deal a small amount of damage to enemies and create a cloud of smoke; Nova Gas will create a small cloud of gas dealing damage to players in the cloud as well as hampering their vision and movement; Flash Bangs will create a bright flash of light blinding players within range; Concussion grenades will hamper the movement and blur the vision of players in range; Decoy grenades will stay on the field for a while and simulate gun fire and make it appear to enemies that there is a player on their mini-map.  Camera Spikes and Motion Sensors both reveal the location of near-by enemies making them ideal for snipers. C4 can be detonated whenever you like. The claymore is also a good choice, it detonates when an opponent gets near it. The Tactical Insertion lets you choose where you spawn getting you back in the game quicker. The Jammer will disable enemy radar and equipment in its radius. All of these make welcome additions to any class.  Finding a perk that fits your playing style is important. The Ghost perk is great for snipers as it allows them to remain hidden from enemy radar. Lightweight will increase your movement speed which is helpful to those who like to stay mobile. Scavenger will allow you to replenish ammo and grenades from fallen soldiers and is good if you find yourself running low on ammunition frequently. Flak Jacket will reduce the damage taken by grenades and other explosives. Hardline is a fantastic addition to any class; it reduces the number of kills required for your killstreaks by 1.  The Scout perk is a must-have for snipers, it allows you to steady your aim for longer periods of time. Steady Aim is perfect for any dual-wield weapon and shotguns. Hardened allows you to shoot through walls. Warlord allows your primary weapon to hold two attachments(excluding Masterkey, Grenade Launcher, and Flamethrower). Sleight of Hand greatly reduces your reload speed and is another perk that goes well with any class.  Tactical Mask makes you immune to Nova Gas. Ninja makes you move silently (good for snipers). Marathon allows you to sprint longer (good to pair with Lightweight). Second Chance gives you the ability to pull out a pistol before you die and maybe even get revived by a teammate. Hacker makes it easy to see enemy equipment, keeping you safe from claymores and other explosives.  

choose your primary weapon.  pick your attachment(s).  pick your secondary weapon.  pick your lethal grenade.  pick your tactical grenade.  choose your equipment.  choose your tier 1 perk.  choose your tier 2 perk.  choose your tier 3 perk. 

 Start wiping down your furniture to remove any dirt and debris. Try wiping down the piece with a clean, slightly damp rag first. Then take a cleaning wipe like Lysol or Clorox and go back over it. You don’t want any dust or grit to get stuck under your coats of paint., Before you start painting, be sure to remove any handles, buttons, or decorative items that you don’t want to paint over. As you remove them, pay attention to where they went and how they were installed. This will make it easier when you have to put everything back on. Place each piece into a ziploc bag so they don’t get lost after you start painting.  If you are painting an older piece or one you purchased from a thrift store, be sure to check it for any marks. Look over the piece first for large discolorations, indents, or scratches. Then run your hands over the item just to be sure. If you find any, use a filler like Elmer’s Wood Filler and a putty knife to close up the gouges.You can also leave these marks if you would prefer a more dated and worn look.  Take a fine grit sandpaper like Pro Grade Precision 220 and use a sponge or sanding block for consistent pressure. This will keep your sanding even. Work from the top downward. Make sure to sand with the grain as sanding against it can deeply damage the wood.Vacuum off and wipe down the furniture again once you’ve finished.  Chalk paint comes in a variety of colors from white and black to baby blue and light green. You can choose any color you’d like, however, keep in mind that depending on the color of the item you’re painting, you may have to put on additional coats. For example, if you are working with darker colored furniture like a deep mahogany or black metal, you may need to apply three to four coats of a lighter paint.However, chalk paint goes on thick and dries quickly, so even multiple coats won’t take long. A four ounce container should also be more than enough. The most popular chalk paint comes from Annie Sloan, but you can also make your own with just latex paint, water, and baking powder., If there are any areas on your furniture that you’d prefer to leave unpainted, make sure to mark them with painter’s tape. For example, if you are working with a dresser or items with drawers, you can add painter’s tape to the side of each to keep them clear. Of course, if you want to paint the entire piece, then painter’s tape is unnecessary.  Pick a small out of the way area on your furniture. This can be on the back of the piece, inside a drawer, or an inconspicuous corner. Apply one coat of paint and let it dry. Then add another layer and allow that to dry as well. Check for any bleed through of the color beneath the paint. If you don’t see any, feel free to continue.   Woods like cherry and mahogany are prone to bleeding through paint and may need to be coated in shellac first. Try a spray shellac like Bull’s Eye and apply two to three coats before painting. The shellac should only take an hour to dry., The top of the piece usually requires the most attention and coats. So it’s best to start from the bottom of the piece and work upwards. Just as you did with sanding, make sure to paint with the grain. This will make applying the paint easier. It should also makes your strokes smoother.   Once you get to the top of the piece, make sure to paint side to side without stopping.  After you apply the first coat of paint the piece will look rough and unfinished. Don't worry! It is normal for the first coat to look a bit unappealing. Wait for this coat to dry and then apply another immediately after. Each coat should take a half hour to an hour to dry., After your paint has dried, begin applying your wax. You can use a product like Annie Sloan’s Clear Soft Wax or Minwax Paste Finishing Wax, which will bond to the paint to create a lasting and durable finish. Use a wax brush or soft cloth to apply the wax. Work in small sections and rub the wax into the surface in circular motions.  Once you’ve covered the entire piece, wait 10-15 minutes and apply another, final coat. Use a brand new cloth and work in the same manner as before, rubbing the wax into the piece in small sections. Use a separate rag to remove any excess wax as you go along. When you are finished, swipe a finger across the surface to make sure there are no streaks. If you see one, simply run a clean cloth over the area to remove the extra wax.It takes wax 21 days to cure completely, so be careful with your furniture until then.  Once the wax dries, reinstall any hardware you removed before you painted. Be careful of the wax that is still curing when you put each item back on. This is also a good time to clean older hardware or to replace the previous pieces with brand new handles, knobs, or decorative items.  

clean off your furniture.  remove any hardware.  fill in gouges and deep scratches when needed.  sand down wood furniture.  choose a chalk paint color.  mark off areas with painter’s tape.  test a small patch.  start painting from the bottom to the top.  apply two to three additional coats.  add a coat of wax.  apply a final coat of wax.  reinstall your hardware. 

 Purchase a day planner that allows you to write down your assignments. Write down assignments as soon as they are mentioned in class. Write down all details, including the due date, page numbers, and requirements for the assignment. Review your planner every day before you sit down for your daily homework time., Don’t wait until the last second to finish big assignments. Set goals in your planner, like when you want to complete research, an outline, and a draft of your paper. Try to arrange your schedule so that you complete drafts for papers several days before they are due. That way, you can go back and edit them with fresh eyes. The stress of completing a paper at the last second can also be debilitating.   Sometimes we procrastinate because we are afraid of failure. You need to conquer these fears. Even great writers have terrible first drafts. The process of editing is how bad writing becomes good. If you are too afraid of failure to start early, failure is precisely what you will get. If procrastination is a problem, consider creating a designated work space, free of distractions. Leave your books and other work material around. If your environment is telling you to work, your brain might just get the message., So that you don’t lose your assignments, keep a separate homework binder for all of your completed assignments. Keep notes and other course materials in their own binders for their respective subjects. 

create a planner.  break up large assignments.  create a homework folder. 

 When a person is on the verge of a mental breakdown the number of cells in the region of the brain called hippocampus get fewer and fewer. But, when a body is exposed to physical exercise the number of cells in the hippocampus goes up. What’s more, the levels of endorphins (feel good hormones) increases, too.Exercise produces endorphins and restricts the release of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline which are often responsible for a mental breakdown. When you are involved in physical activity your focus tends to shift away from tasks, events and situations that are creating stress in you, which provides time for your mind to recover from stress.  When you are in a high state of stress, you may experience sleep-related problems, including insomnia. A lack of sleep will make stress even worse and could lead to a mental breakdown.Try to get at least 7 hours of quality sleep every night. Sleep needs vary from person to person, so you may need more or less sleep depending on your activity level, age, and other factors.  Sometimes stress may be aggravated by medical conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies. Common vitamin deficiencies include vitamin D, B6, and B12. Being deficient in these nutrients could add to your stress and lead to a mental breakdown.If you have not had an appointment with your doctor in a while, schedule a routine check-up to make sure that you are healthy and that you are getting all of the nutrients you need to stay healthy.  Amino acids play a crucial role in controlling the symptoms caused by stress and depression thus preventing the progress towards mental breakdown Amino acids make up most of the neurotransmitters in the brain, so they are essential for mental health. The basic structure of proteins is composed of amino acids.To enjoy the benefits of amino acids, follow a diet rich in proteins such as milk, dairy products, eggs, poultry, meat, peas, beans, legumes and grains. Dopamine is a product of an amino acid called tyrosine while serotonin a product of tryptophan. Insufficient synthesis of neurotransmitters in the brain is associated with bad mood and mood swings. This holds greater significance if the transmitters are dopamine and serotonin.  A high intake of sugar can promote inflammation in the body that in turn disturbs the normal functioning of the brain. Processed foods like candy, cookies, sodas, and others tend to have the most sugar. Steer clear of these types of foods as much as you can to reduce inflammation.High intake of sugar and carbohydrates leads to excessive release of insulin that can also trigger hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia in turn causes the brain to release glutamate in the brain in levels that are both alarming and that can cause symptoms that are indicative of mental breakdown such as anxiety, depression, panic attacks  , Both forms of carbohydrates boost the levels of serotonin (a brain calming and mood enhancing hormone) but with complex carbs (whole grain bread, cereals) the process is gradual and consistent because they are digested slowly. Simple carbs (sweets, candy, soda) which are rich in sugars are digested easily, which results in a spike followed by a crash in serotonin.Avoid or limit foods such as processed foods and foods rich in sugars and gluten. They can be dangerous to an already stressed body and may speed up the process of mental breakdown  , A deficiency in folic acid may also contribute to a stress response. Please be aware that a folic acid deficiency can only be diagnosed by a physician, and any supplements taken should be under a physician’s direction and supervision. A folic acid deficiency may lead to neurological problems such as depression. Having an adequate amount of folic acid in the body also improves the effectiveness of antidepressants.To get more folic acid from food, include spinach and citrus fruits, like oranges, in your diet.  Foods with B-vitamins help to shield you against depression and mental breakdowns. B complex vitamins and especially B1, B2 and B6 vitamins show promising results when it comes to improving mood. Foods rich in B-vitamins include:Dark leafy green vegetables Red meat whole grains, wheat germ, Green peas Lentils, nuts such as pecans and almonds, milk, yogurt, cheese, poultry, fish, eggs, legumes, peanuts, seafood, bananas, potatoes  , There is ample research to show that zinc levels are often quite low in people who show symptoms of stress, depression, or who are on the verge of a mental breakdown. Also having an adequate amount of zinc in your body either through diet or oral supplements can improve the effectiveness of any medications that you take for depression and other mental related problems. Foods rich in zinc include:seafood nuts wheat germ pumpkin seeds spinach mushrooms beans meat  , Iodine, Iron and chromium play a very important role in preventing mental breakdown. Deficiency in these vital minerals may lead to fatigue, depression, and mood swings.Foods rich in Iron: red meat, dark leafy green vegetables, egg yolks, dried fruits (raisins, prunes), poultry, beans, lentils, artichokes Foods rich in iodine: cow’s milk, yogurt, strawberry, sea vegetables, eggs, soy milk, saltwater fish and cheese Foods rich in chromium: whole grains, meat, brown rice, seafood, broccoli, mushrooms, beans, dairy products, eggs, cheese, milk, poultry, corn, potatoes, fish, tomatoes, barley, oats, herbs  

exercise to help your body create stress-reducing endorphins.  get plenty of sleep each night.  schedule regular check-ups to make sure that you are not deficient in any nutrients.  eat amino acids to keep your mental health strong.  keep tabs on your sugar and processed food intake.  choose complex carbs over simple carbs.  up your intake of folic acid.  try eating more b-vitamin foods.  get more zinc to stay stress-free.  eat foods rich in iron, iodine, and chromium. 

; , You should see several things going on. It'll open to a page where you'll be able to scan all of the QR codes and barcodes that exist on most products and all store shelves.  Make sure the scanner has sufficient light and all of the barcode is in sight of the lens. The app will readjust the light to focus in on the code, if it recognizes the overall design as being that of an accepted code.   Realize that while a Microsoft Tag code looks similar to a QR code in style, ScanLife can't read it. Microsoft Tags can only be read on the Microsoft Tag app.  If you scan a QR code, you'll be asked whether or not you'd like to visit the webpage the code is asking the user to view. If it's a barcode, you'll be taken directly to the NexTag site for the product with the barcode you've scanned.  This is where you'll see all of your other recent code-scans.  Although this will rarely change when viewed minute-by-minute, it will change in a day-by-day form (unless you've got very active friends who use ScanLife a lot).

 If your child has a favorite stuffed animal that they like to cozy up with each night, bring that along on your travels. Your child may feel comfortable having their favorite bunny or teddy bear nearby, or it may help them feel like they have a friend to bring along.   Be sure that the stuffed animal is small enough to easily pack in a suitcase or backpack. If your child’s favorite plush toy is an over-sized bear, you may wish to consider packing a smaller stuffed animal that your child likes. Consider packing a small doll or action figure as well.; , Select two or three of your toddler’s books to take with you. Choose a book that you know your toddler loves and another new, colorful book that will capture their attention. Reading to your toddler is important for establishing the foundations of basic literacy skills.If you are on a train or a plane, read the books to your toddler and let them look through the pages on their own afterward.  Stacking cups are simple, colorful, and versatile toys that your toddler can take along. Your toddler can use their imagination and find endless games to play. They can sort them by color, use them to hold snacks, or build towers in the safety of their car seat.Nest them neatly so that they don’t take up too much space in your tot’s travel bag.  Your toddler may have endless fun traveling with their very own transportation toys. Check to see if your toy store or department store carries age-appropriate toys shaped like airplanes, trains, cars, or trucks. If you are flying to visit a family member, you can show your little one how they are flying through the air with their very own toy airplane. If you are taking a train to visit a new city, show your toddler how the trains zoom quickly between towns.  

take along your toddler’s favorite stuffed animal.  plan to take a few books.  toss some stacking cups in the travel bag.  use toy trains, planes, and automobiles. 

 Use an MP3 player, radio, whatever you've got that plays music. Make sure the music isn't too relaxing that you start to become lazy. Also check that you keep it at a decent level making sure not to bother others in the house.; , It will waste some electricity, but as long as you don't take forever and you try your best to save electric, it should be okay. Turning on the lights will help you see different areas of the room so you don't miss any spots when cleaning.  This may help cool you down if you're starting to become exhausted from all the cleaning. Also, it will cool down your room and keep it fresher smelling while you're going through all the areas.  Start with your bed. Take a broom or something long and sweep everything out, no matter how much there is, and put it in a pile. Don't organize the pile yet. Then go to your dresser. Then all of the other furniture, putting everything into the same pile.  It may seem ridiculous but now you can dust easier. Put all of this in the same pile as the stuff from under the bed and other furniture. If you would like, you can even take out the stuff from in your drawers. This will totally clear your room.  Go through the pile and gather everything that's trash. Make a trash pile, clothes pile, other room pile, stay-in-here pile, give away pile, and/or any other pile you need to make.  It may be more convenient if you keep a trash bag in your room but it's up to you. You're just throwing stuff out, not organizing yet.  This way you will have less stuff on your floor and it will be easier for you to maneuver your way around.  Sort the clothes from what is dirty and what is clean. Then put your clothes in front of the dresser so you don't start organizing them yet.  For example, if you have books put them in front of your bookshelf. Do not start putting it away yet. If you have stuff that doesn't belong anywhere, keep that in the middle of your room.  Grab something to dust with, whether it be a rag or feather duster, it doesn't matter, just something to get the job done.  Go to the biggest pile and start putting it away. You want to dust it before you put it back in the place where it belongs. Now is the time to organize. After you are done with the biggest pile, move to the next biggest pile, and so on.  Now is the time to fix your bed. Take off the sheets, wash the sheets, flip the mattress, do anything else pertaining to your bed.  Wipe off the walls with a wet rag. , You've been working hard so give yourself a break. It should be about 10-20 minutes long. Don't forget to turn all electronics such as lights and music off.  Look around the room. Check your closet. Clean out your closet if it needs it. Then check your bathroom if you have one. Focus on the finishing touches.  What type of floor you have will change what type of tool you will use to clean it. If you have carpet, vacuum then use carpet cleaner. This can make a room look a lot different. If you have hard wood flooring, mop it.  Now that your walls are clean hang up posters or pictures of things that you love. For example, a picture of your favorite band or a picture of your family.  You don't want to miss any spots so go over some of the steps above and have a good check of your room.  Don't use to much, but a little spritz here and there will definitely make your room smell inviting to those who come. You can use all sorts of brands, but don't combine. That gives a weird odor to your room. Make sure to spray where your shoes are because it can become very smelly over there.  Now that your room is clean, take a second and sit down. Enjoy the looks of your room and try your best to keep it that way for as long as possible. Every week try to go through this list and make sure your room is thoroughly clean.  

put on music.  turn on a lot of lights.  if necessary, put on a fan or open the windows.  take everything out from under all your furniture.  clear off the top of all your furniture.  now's the time to sort the pile.  take the trash and throw it away.  grab the 'give-away' stuff and put it in another room.  gather all the clothes.  put everything else in piles in front of where they belong.  dust.  start with the biggest pile.  take off your bed sheets.  wipe down the walls.  wipe off all furniture or doors—this can really make a room look a lot nicer.  ,  take a break.  straighten up anything else that needs attention.  vacuum or sweep.  hang up some different things on the walls.  double-check everything.  spray an air freshener.  sit down and enjoy your clean room. 

 If you have chronic acid reflux, you may need to adjust your diet so you are not having any foods or beverages that could trigger acid reflux. Start a food diary (either on paper or on your smartphone), recording foods that you ate within one to two hours that then lead to symptoms of acid reflux. You can then remove those foods from your diet so your body is not triggered by them.   For example, maybe you eat breaded chicken, broccoli, and pasta in tomato sauce for dinner. Within an hour, you develop acid reflux. The trigger could be the chicken, the breading on the chicken, the broccoli, the pasta, or the tomato sauce. Start by eliminating tomato sauce from you next meal. If you do not develop acid reflux after eating the tomato sauce, the tomato sauce is likely the trigger. But if you still have acid reflux, the issue may be the other foods you ate. Eliminate each food until you no longer have acid reflux.  Eating smaller meals puts less stress pressure on your stomach, allowing your digestive system to function properly and reducing the amount of stomach acid disruption in your stomach.   You should also eat slowly by chewing your food several times before swallowing. This will help you digest more easily and quickly, leaving less food in your stomach and putting less pressure on your digestive system. Try to have your meals two to three hours before bedtime. Eating earlier in the night will allow your stomach to digest the food properly before you lie down in bed.  Smoking can increase the acid in your stomach and increase your risk of acid reflux. If you are not able to quit smoking, try not to smoke at least two hours before your bedtime.  Chewing sugar-free gum after meals can help to stimulate your salivary glands. This can then release bicarbonate into your saliva and help to neutralize the acid in your esophagus., This will allow gravity to help keep the acid in your stomach and prevent it from rising into your esophagus. You will need to actually raise your bed frame or the top section of your bed. Piling pillows on your bed and laying on them will not help as much as this will cause you to bend your neck and body in a way that will increase the pressure. This can then make the acid reflux worse., The “heel drop” is used to treat a hiatal hernia but it can also be used to relieve acid reflux. This method can help to realign your stomach and your diaphragm.Start by drinking 6 to 8 ounces of slightly warm water. Then, stand up and bring your arms straight out to your sides. Bend your arms at the elbows and bring both hands to meet your chest. Stand on your toes so your heels are lifted. Then, drop your heels down to the ground. Repeat this 10 times. After the 10th drop, keep your arms up and pant in short, quick breaths for 15 seconds.  

identify any food triggers and avoid them.  eat smaller meals and chew your food slowly.  do not smoke two hours before bedtime or quit smoking.  chew gum after a heavy meal, especially at night.  raise the entire head of your bed.  do the “heel drop” 15–30 minutes before bed. 

 Acrylic is a soft, malleable finish, which means it can easily be scratched or marked up if you’re not careful. To prevent doing lasting damage to your shower, pick out a product that doesn’t contain any harsh chemicals or astringents. Your best bet is to use a mild acid-based solution like Lysol Power Bathroom Cleaner, Formula 409 All-Purpose cleaner or Bar Keeper’s Friend.Stay away from any type of astringent cleanser, including Comet, Ajax and Scrubbing Bubbles, as well as solvents like acetone. Whenever possible, using natural derivatives to clean your bathroom will be your safest choice.; , Apply the cleaner liberally to areas where grime, soap scum and hard water stains have accumulated. Focus on spots that suffer from visible dirt or discoloration. You may need to use quite a bit of cleaner in order to penetrate multiple layers of dried-on residue.   Be sure to remove all soaps, shampoos and other hygiene products from the shower before you get started so that you can clean underneath them. Pull back the shower curtain all the way and turn on the overhead fan to keep the bathroom properly ventilated while you clean.  After a few minutes, the dingy messes that have built up on the surface of your acrylic shower will begin to dissolve. This will allow you to wipe them away with ease.If you’re dealing with particularly heavy soap scum or stains, it may help to reapply the cleaner once or twice. Use this time to take care of any other cleaning tasks you need to complete, like detailing the faucet or shower head.  Turn on the shower head and direct the flow of water over the areas of the acrylic you just sprayed. Wash away as much liquefied grime and cleaning solution as you can. Once you’ve given the shower a preliminary rinse, go over the acrylic with using a soft microfiber towel or sponge to remove any remaining residue.Never use abrasive scrubbers, such as wire brushes or rough kitchen sponges, to clean an acrylic surface. These will leave behind tiny scratches in the finish that will then trap dirt in the future, making it much harder to remove. 

choose a non-abrasive cleaning solution.  spray the product onto shower stains.  let the cleaner sit for 5-10 minutes.  rinse and wipe out the shower. 

 The best time of the year to remove poison sumac is between May and July, or when the plant is flowering.Wait until then to begin the process of removing the poison sumac., Before you get started, make sure to cover all of your skin. Wear a long sleeve shirt, pants that cover your legs completely, socks and shoes that cover your feet, and gloves. This will help to reduce your chances of exposure.  Do not wear rubber or latex gloves because they will not protect you from the urushiol in the poison sumac., An herbicide like Roundup is a good choice. Cut the tree or bush down to about one foot above ground level, then apply the plant spray immediately. Make sure to spray all areas of the plant including the roots, vines, and leaves. You may have to do several treatments. Continue to spray the plants until no new growth appears.  Keep in mind that spraying the plants with herbicides may kill other plants in the area., Once the sumac tree or bush is dead, collect all of the plant remains including any leaves that have fallen off the plant. Place the dead plant materials in trash bags and put the bags out with the trash.  Do not burn any of the plant materials because the smoke can irritate your lungs and cause a rash if it comes into contact with your skin. 

wait until the plant is flowering.  put on protective clothing.  use an herbicide that is absorbed through the leaves.  throw away all of the dead plant materials. 

 If you've already washed it recently, you can simply get it wet. Blot it dry with a towel and let it air dry the rest of the way. Make sure that your hair is completely dry before you begin.  Brush or comb through your hair well. Make sure that there are no tangles in your hair at all., Choose a soft elastic headband, the type that wraps all the way around your head to keep your hair out of your face. Working in sections, wrap your hair around the headband and use hairpins to pin the ends in place as you go. Continue until all of your hair has been wrapped around the headband.         You can also wrap you hair around the bottom part of the headband only.  Unpin each section of your hair and let the curls down. Continue until your hair is completely loose.Keep your sweet, vintage curls in place by scrunching them with a dollop of mousse and spraying your hair lightly with hairspray.         

wash and condition your hair as usual.  brush out your hair.  wrap your hair around a headband.  remove the headband and shake out your curls. 

 Find your lease agreement and review it for an opt-out clause that specifies your rights and responsibilities in the event that you decide to break the lease. This agreement may specify a timeline for giving notice of your intent to leave the lease early and may also specify penalties in the form of fines and lost security deposits.Look for the words "early release," "sub-let," or "re-let" when examining your lease. The exact language may vary between lease agreements.; , Some rental agreements require that you find a replacement renter if you break your lease.Others require that your landlord find a replacement renter after you give them notice of leaving the lease. In this case, you would have to pay for the intermediate months before they find a replacement for you, so plan ahead financially if this is the case. This information can be found in your lease agreement., In most cases, your lease will also specify the required duties of the landlord, including things like responding to complaints and repair requests. If your landlord is not fulfilling their end of the bargain, you may have grounds to break your lease and move out. However, this generally requires taking your landlord to court, which may be more trouble than it's worth.  There may be additional landlord obligations not listed in your lease that can be found in your municipal regulations and state laws. Check these sources for more information.  Because many lease agreements require advance notice when you leave your lease, it's best to communicate your intentions to your landlord as early as possible. In other words, let your landlord know as soon as you decide to go through with breaking your lease. This can give the landlord more time to prepare for your departure and may make them more likely to work with you towards an amenable resolution., Before you do anything else, simply try to explain to your landlord what your situation is. It's likely that they've had other tenants get out of leases before and are likely able to offer a few possible solutions. Hopefully, your landlord will be understanding, although there is no guarantee that they will be. This conversation is always easier if you've been a good tenant, doing things like paying your rent on time and not causing disturbances in the building.Be as open as possible. The more your landlord knows, the more they will be able to help you. For example, be sure to tell them if you are unable to give the required amount of notice., In many states, both you and your landlord are required to work towards finding a replacement renter in the event that you leave your lease early. This replacement can be either a new renter or a sub-letter on your lease. In either case, be prepared to pay your rent for the months until you can find a replacement renter.Finding a sub-letter means finding someone willing to take over payments on your current lease and live in your apartment. The lease, however, will still be in your name, so you are liable for payments being made and any damage done to the apartment by the sub-letter. Check with your Facebook friends to see if they know anyone looking for an apartment. This is the easiest way to get a sub-letter that you trust., If you are unable or unwilling to find a replacement renter, your lease or landlord may offer you the chance to simply pay your way out of the lease with a termination agreement. In many cases, this will involve paying several months rent after you move out and giving up your security deposit. However, you benefit from being immediately and completely out of your lease obligations., Every city, state, or region has its own laws. In order to know how you can legally break your lease, take a look at yours. Once you're familiar with the laws, you can then read deeper into your lease and possibly find a legal reason in your living situation to vacate.#*The remainder of these steps will only work under laws which vary from place to place, and you may end up needing to hire a lawyer. Even then, sometimes the law will not be on your side. Always proceed with caution., Many landlords use standard-form lease agreements. This can potentially lead to errors that will make the lease agreement legally invalid in your city or state. While this will require hiring a lawyer, the overall costs will likely be cheaper than paying the remainder of your rent., Your landlord is required to repair conditions that materially affect the physical health and safety of an ordinary tenant. You have to specify this condition in a notice certified return receipt to the place of which rent is normally paid, and you can’t owe any rent at the time. In most cases, you must give the landlord time to make the repair, and send another written notice before you can take legal action.Examples of these conditions might be:   Mold Termites or other bug infestations Broken smoke detectors Severely loose railing on your balcony Holes in carpeting that could trip someone Security issues (e.g. broken lock, doorknob, or gate) You as the tenant (or any of your friends) can’t cause this condition – so don’t take a sledgehammer to your smoke detector.  If your landlord is violating your privacy rights, that is also grounds for legally breaking a lease. He or she is only allowed on the premises with your knowledge., If your lease doesn't already have a lease-break clause which specifies what you must do in order to break the lease, then you'll have to work this out with the landlord. This is the best way to get out of a lease because you won't burn bridges and taint your rental history. Consider some negotiation points:   Offer up part or all of your security deposit. Offer to continue paying rent for 1-2 months after you vacate. Volunteer to find the next tenant to sign a new lease (you shoulder the costs of placing ads, costs of any screening, and showing the unit to prospective tenants). Finding a replacement renter can also help you avoid paying extra costs or settlement fees., This may be found in your lease as “the landlord’s duty to mitigate damages.” That means that in the situation where you don't pay your rent, your landlord can't just sit back and wait to sue you. They have to make strides to filling your space – and then that money gets taken off your debt. If this is applicable in your area, it may mean you're only required to pay a month or so's rent., If you don't have a legal reason for leaving (and even if you do), give notice that you will be vacating the premises. And be polite about it – the more mature and respectful you are, the less likely your landlord will decide to be a pain in your side. Written notice 30 days prior to leaving is best.Even if your landlord is being difficult, always stay polite. Make sure to communicate via email or in print and keep copies should you need them later. Be honest and thorough, doing everything you can. Threats of a lawsuit can constitute retaliation and bad faith in some jurisdictions. If your landlord does this, get it in writing. It's another point in your favor., Unless you have adequate reason to leave, the law will likely not be on your side. Don't think you can take this to court – it'll likely just add to your debt. After all, you signed a contract. Even if you're not there, you made the promise that you would pay that money.   If you've tried to be nice about it and negotiate, consider contacting a mediator. Often these are publicly-funded. 

look for an opt-out clause.  find a replacement renter, if necessary.  check to see that your landlord is meeting his or her obligations.  talk to your landlord as soon as possible.  explain your situation.  work with your landlord to find a replacement renter.  consider a termination agreement.  check your area's laws.  check to see if your lease agreement is legally valid.  find something in your apartment that is dangerous.  take action if the landlord has violated your right to privacy .  negotiate a lease-break agreement.  check your landlord's "duty to rent.",  give adequate and polite notice.  know that when you break a lease, the law is generally on the landlord's side. 

 The majority of Pokémon evolve when they reach a certain level. A Pokémon "levels up" (gains a level) by gaining experience points from fights. The level that triggers an evolution varies from Pokémon to Pokémon.   If you're unsure when or how a Pokémon will evolve, this information is easy to find online. You can check the Pokémon's page on a Pokémon resource site like Bulbapedia, for instance.Note that select Pokémon will only evolve by using special items or by meeting special conditions. For example, Eevee requires an evolutionary stone to evolve no matter how many levels it gains.; , When you get your Pokémon to a high enough level (or use an evolution stone, etc.), you will see an evolution dialogue screen with "What? (name of Pokémon) is evolving!" or a similar message. Wait for the evolution "animation" to appear. The screen may flash and the Pokémon may "blink" between its current form and its next evolution.   More modern Pokémon games generally have fancier evolution screens than older games, but the general idea is the same for all games in the series.  As soon as you see the animation begin, press the B button rapidly. Don't wait too long or the evolution will finish.   Eventually, you will see "Huh? (name of Pokémon) stopped evolving!" or a similar message. At this point, the evolution is canceled. If your Pokémon gained a level, it will keep its level but will stay in the same form.  Cancelling an evolution once will not cancel it in the future. If your Pokémon starts to evolve again, you will need to repeat the process above to cancel it. If you don't, it will evolve.   For Pokémon that evolve normally from leveling up, you'll need to cancel every time the Pokémon gains a level.  

wait until your pokémon starts to evolve.  watch for the evolution animation.  press b repeatedly.  repeat as needed. 

 Once the mixture has melted cool for about five minutes and place on the mixer stand. Add a little Crisco to the paddle attachments.  Take them out and very carefully stir with a wooden spoon, they are very hot and thin and accidents happen easily at this point. Add a little Crisco. If using corn syrup add now and stir with the wooden spoon or the mixer.  When half the sugar has been incorporated knead by hand for about seven minutes, or use a bread hook on the mixer. Whilst you are kneading dip your hands in a light coating of Crisco and knead it in. Use sparingly to start with, as the finished product will be sticky if you have added too much. Add a little more sugar once the last cup has been incorporated. If it is too hot to do by hand then use a wooden spoon. This mixture will become very stiff and resistant to handling as you add more sugar. Re-grease your hands and rework the MMF until it is smooth and elastic and pliable.  If you are doing it with the dough hook then keep it on low and knead for about four minutes.  

if you are using a mixer to knead the mmf, put the marshmallows, and water in the mixer bowl and place over a pan of hot water, make sure that the bowl is not touching the water.  if you intend to knead the mmf by hand then place the marshmallows and water in the microwave for a half a minute, just long enough to melt them, if they are still not melted pub back in for five seconds and repeat this until they are melted.  add the confectioners’ sugar one cup at a time, and fold in until the mixture is not sticky before adding the next cup.  the whole process of kneading working the dough and adding the sugar should take about seven or eight minutes by hand. 

 Free patterns for Minecraft character heads are available online, or you can choose to make your own on your computer. Once you have the right pattern, save the pattern files to a thumb drive.   To search for a pattern, go to your favorite search engine and type in adequate search terms like "Minecraft Steve head pattern" or "Creeper head PDF." A few popular—and free—patterns can be found here:  Steve head: http://www.stevelange.net/2011/10/24/making-your-own-minecraft-steve-head-from-pdfs/  Creeper head: http://stlmotherhood.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/CREEPER-Mask-and-sides.pdf  Enderman head: http://pixelpapercraft.com/papercraft/50904699f7e521e71f00003c/life-size-enderman-head    Alternatively, you can use any high-resolution image of the desired character's head and enlarge all five sides to a size of 11-inches by 11-inches (28-cm by 28-cm).; , Take the saved pattern to copy shop and print off all five sides of the head.   If you have a large printer with plenty of ink at home, you might be able print the pattern yourself. For most people, however, your local copy shop is a better option. Print the patterns in poster setting with a tile scale of 100% and an overlap of 0.005 inches (0.0127 mm). The pattern will need to be printed on 11-inch by 17-inch (28-cm by 43-cm) paper., You'll need a cardboard box shaped as an 11-inch (28-cm) cube.   You can either buy an 11-inch (28-cm) cubical box or trim down a larger box so until all three dimensions (length, width, height) are 11 inches (28 cm) long. Tape the bottom of the box closed, if necessary. Fold the flaps on the top side into the box to create an opening. If the flaps threaten to fall back down when the box is inverted, tape them to the inside of the box.  Turn the box upside-down so that the closed bottom is now the top. Coat the new top with spray adhesive or glue from a standard glue stick, then carefully press the hair portion of the pattern onto the box.   Note that you will need to trim off any excess white paper from the pattern image before adhering the image to the box. There will probably be some overlap onto the sides of the box. You can hold this overlap down with additional glue or clear tape.  Work around all four sides of the box, gluing the rest of the head portion on one side at a time.   As with the hair, you will need to trim away any excess white paper before gluing the pattern images to the side of the box. Use spray adhesive or a standard glue stick to adhere the pattern pieces to the box. Make sure that the pattern pieces match up appropriately. In other words, the back image of the head should lie on the opposite side of the box as the face image, the left side image should be to the left of the face, and the right side image should be to the right of the face.  Use a box cutter or utility knife to cut out the two square eyes at the front of the face image. This will create eye holes for the wearer to see through.   At this point, the head portion of the costume should be finished and read to wear.  Minecraft Steve wears an aqua t-shirt and standard blue jeans.A light blue t-shirt could also work if you are unable to find an aqua shirt. Tuck the shirt into the jeans around the right front side. Leave it un-tucked on the left side and in the back.  The game character wears dark gray shoes, so if you have gray or black sneakers, those would be your best choice for this costume.  Use scissors to cut out enough squares to cover the arms, legs, and torso of the costume wearer's body.s   You'll need to use four to five different shades of green. The exact number of felt squares you'll need will vary depending on the size of the wearer. For a small boy's costume, you will need approximately 30 sheets of 8-inch by 11-inch (20-cm by 28-cm) felt. Try to keep the consistently sized. Cut them out so that they are approximately 3 inches (7.6 cm) to 4 inches (10 cm) in length/width.  Glue the squares of green felt onto a green sweatshirt and green sweatpants. Use a hot glue gun for best results.   If you are unable to find a green sweat suit, opt for a gray or black one. Arrange the squares side by side and randomize the pattern as well as possible. Only apply a small dab of glue to all four corners of each square before sticking it to the material.  Green sneakers are hard to come by, but gray or black shoes will work adequately well for this costume.  Endermen are entirely black, so the body of the costume should consist of a long-sleeve black t-shirt, black pants, and black shoes.   Endermen also have notable long arms, so you could mimic this effect by wearing an oversized long-sleeve shirt with arms that extend well below your waist.  Endermen are often seen carrying blocks in the game, so you can enhance the costume by carrying around a small cubical box or block.   Consider painting the block to look like dirt, grass, gravel, sand, or TNT. Alternatively, you can carry around a fake flower. Endermen can carry tulips, orchids, dandelions, poppies, and other flowers in the game, making this another worthwhile accessory for your costume.  You should be able to find free patterns for the player's diamond sword and diamond pickaxe online, but you may also be able to create them on your computer. Save the pattern to a thumb drive once you find the right one.   Go to your favorite search engine and try searching along the lines of "free Minecraft pickaxe pattern" or "diamond sword costume printable." You can find free printable patterns here:  Diamond Pickaxe: http://kerryannmorgan.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Minecraft-pickaxe-template-pdf.pdf  Diamond sword blade: http://kerryannmorgan.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/diamond-sword-template-1-pdf.pdf  Diamond sword handle: http://kerryannmorgan.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/minecraft-diamond-sword-2-pdf.pdf    Another option is to find high-resolution images of the diamond pickaxe and/or diamond sword and enlarge them on your computer until they are roughly 11 inches (28 cm) wide by 17 inches (43 cm) long.  Print the patterns onto 11-inch by 17-inch (28-cm by 43-cm) paper.If your home printer is capable of printing onto paper that large, you can print the patterns out at home. Consider using heavy cardstock or photograph paper to maximize the image quality. Another option would be to take the files to your local copy shop and print them out there. The image quality will be better, and if you're already going there to print out the patterns for the costume head, you can get these patterns printed out during the same trip.  Use scissors to cut around the images in the pattern.   Trim off as much excess blank space as possible. You should cut around the images, but you do not need to worry about cutting around every block during this step. The only place you need to be precise at are the edges where separate pieces (the blade image and the handle image) will join together. Open edges can be roughly cut.  Lightly coat the back of each pattern image with spray adhesive, then firmly press the image onto foam core board. Allow the glue to dry.   A standard glue stick can be used instead of spray adhesive if desired. Use foam core board instead of using craft foam board. Foam core board is stiffer and more durable, making it ideal for use with costume accessories. Arrange the separate pieces of each tool onto the foam board in the proper order. In other words, the handle of each tool must be centered and connected to the blade of the corresponding tool. If necessary, use a metal L-ruler to match the angle of the handle to the angle of the blade.  Use a utility knife to cut round the entire perimeter of each tool. Once the tool is cut, it should be ready to use for your costume.   During this step, you will need to make precise cuts around each block of the perimeter. Place the foam onto a hard garage floor or cutting board before cutting out the pieces. You will need to apply enough pressure for the knife to cut cleanly through both the paper and foam.  

find the right pattern.  print the pattern onto poster paper.  prepare the box.  glue the hair to the top of the box.  adhere the remaining pieces to the sides of the box.  cut eye holes.  wear an aqua t-shirt and jeans.  opt for gray shoes, if possible.  cut squares from green felt.  adhere the felt squares to a green sweat suit.  wear dark shoes.  dress in all black clothing.  consider carrying a box.  find the right patterns.  print the patterns.  cut around the shapes.  adhere the pieces onto foam board.  cut the board. 

 Overcoming problems in your career can be tricky. You peers can be friends, advisors, and adversaries all at the same time. When you have problems in your career, you are likely to be told to suck it up and fall in line. Many peers may not be receptive to you “solving” your problems if it does not directly benefit them. You risk causing new problems, including being fired, if you rock the boat too much., Innovative solutions to your problems at work can send you to the forefront of your field. It is likely that if you are having a problem in your career, others in the same career are having the same problem. Innovation does not happen by “falling in line,” but do not expect support from most peers. Some like things the way they are, others will be envious of your innovation., Do not let a solution to one problem inflate your ego too much. Alienating those who did not support an idea may prove to cripple your career later. Take the criticism as constructive and leave doors open with peers that you may have to work with ― or for ― in the future.  

evaluate the risk of damaging your career or reputation.  challenge the status quo in your company or field.  leave doors open to colleges who question your approach. 

; , Open it up to a completely random page.  Count each word until you find the word that is the number that you picked in the last step. For example, let's say you pick 18. You would count each word until you find the 18th word. If you run out of words to count to the number you chose, start again at the top. Don't go to the next page.  If it is an adjective, you may want to put it in front of your name. If it is a verb, you could put it in front of your name in the present form (e.g.: Living Stephanie). If it is a noun, you could say something like, '*insert name here* loves *insert noun here* (e.g: Melissa loves Bananas). 

write your first name down on a piece of paper.  grab a dictionary or thesaurus.  pick a number from 1-25.  put the word in your name according to what type of word it is (adjective, noun, verb, or adverb).  if you don't like the name you chose, repeat the process.  

 Train your cat immediately, whether you've brought home a new cat or just noticed your cat jumping on the furniture. Don't assume that the cat will simply stop jumping or will grow bored with it. Instead, show your displeasure and let your cat know that she's not allowed to jump on the furniture.   Avoid punishing your cat since she will not understand why you're yelling, hitting, or spraying with water.; , When you see your cat jump on the furniture, look at her and say "no" in a firm voice. Do not yell at her, but let her know you're unhappy. Pick her up and remove her from the furniture while saying "no." Set her down in a spot she's allowed to be (like her cat bed, a cat tower, or some other comfy place that she enjoys).   Don't punish your cat once you've removed her from the furniture. Let her go find somewhere else to explore.  If your cat returns to the furniture and jumps on it, say "no" again and remove her. You need to do this every time you see your cat jump up on the furniture. Over time, she'll associate jumping on the furniture with being removed from it.   Your cat will be confused if you only remove her some of the times she jumps on the furniture. Send a consistent message that jumping on the furniture is not allowed.  Startle your cat by placing something like aluminum foil on the furniture. Your cat will be surprised by the noise when she jumps up on the furniture. You can also fill a can with rocks and shake it when you notice her jumping, although she shouldn't see you shaking it. Instead, she should associate jumping on the furniture with a surprising noise.   Consider using something that will make noise when you're not home (like the aluminum foil).  Cats don't like the feeling of being stuck, so place double-sided tape along all parts of the furniture. Your cat will probably jump up, feel uncomfortable, and then jump off. You may want to leave the adhesive on for a day or two, so that she understands not to jump on the furniture.   Some pet stores carry a double-sided adhesive that doesn't leave a residue when it's removed., Surprise your cat by spraying her with water or an unpleasant-tasting spray. You can buy bitter apple spray from pet stores. When you see your cat jump on the furniture, immediately spray her. This will startle her and she should begin to associate the furniture with an unpleasant surprise.   Spraying your cat with water might prevent her from jumping on the furniture, but some argue that it destroys your bond with your cat and can increase her stress level., This may be a hassle for you, but you may want to fill the furniture so that you cat can no longer jump on the furniture and rest comfortably. You might place books, large boxes, or just make it difficult for the cat to even get close to the furniture.   It may take a few days for your cat to move on. Be aware that very determined cats might keep trying to jump on the furniture, regardless of the obstacles you throw in her way.  Know that your cat wants on the furniture for a reason. There may be a good view from the couch. Or, she may like cuddling on a big armchair. Your cat may be determined to keep jumping on the furniture and she might be doing it out of boredom.Remember that your cat isn't jumping on the furniture to bother you. Don't take the behavior personally, just work to prevent it.  Your cat might be jumping on the furniture to get a good view. Help her look outside by hanging a cat shelf. This shelf can be hung low enough for your cat to jump up on and get to a window. Or, place several cat shelves so she can jump around.You can also place a cat tower near a window. This way, she can climb up and still get a good view.  Teach your cat to respond to commands by using a clicking device. Make your cat associate the clicking sound of the device with reward. For example, click the device and give your cat a cuddle or treat. Do this a few times until she understands that she gets a reward after the click.Once your cat understands the clicker, use it to encourage her when she jumps onto places she's allowed, like her bed, cat tower, or designated space., Your cat may be jumping up on the furniture because she's bored. Offer her new toys to help her use up energy. Get several toys that you can scatter along the floor. This might also redirect her interest back to the floor and away from the furniture. Some good toys might be:Corks Ping-pong balls Plastic balls with bells inside Sisal-wrapped tubes  

start training early.  say "no".  be consistent.  set a noise trap.  place double-sided tape on the furniture.  spray your cat.  block the furniture.  figure out why your cat is jumping.  provide other things to jump on.  clicker train your cat to jump on other things.  give your cat new toys. 

 This includes a transducer, computer, ultrasound gel and the object to image.   Gather all of your items at first so that you will not have to run around trying to find things. Wash your hands if they are dirty.; , This might be on a PC, laptop or a medical imaging computer. The software is where you will see the image.   Different machines have different techniques. Get to know your machine and where things are placed. There are many different softwares to run an ultrasound. For research purposes, MATLAB is very common.  Insert the transducer into the transducer port and lock it by turning the knob vertically. This locks the transducer into place. In order to remove the transducer, simply turn the knob horizontally and remove.   Freeze the screen on your program before you do this. Push a little harder or wiggle it around if the transducer does not go into the port perfectly.  Ultrasound gel is always used between the head of the probe and the object being imaged. The gel makes it easier to see the image.   Apply a gracious, half a centimeter thick layer over the top surface. There is never too much gel, only too little.  The gel might feel cold to the patient but does not do any harm. Unfreeze the frame on the computer once the transducer is touching the object.   Move the transducer around while looking at the image on the computer. Locate the place you want to take the image. Zeroing in on your focal point might take some time. Be sure to practice so that you can find what you are looking for faster.  Increase or decrease the brightness or contrast in order to obtain a clearer picture. Play around with the settings on your device. Some settings might be better to use than others; it really depends on what you are imaging.   You know that it is a good image if the focal point is in the middle of the frame and there is a good contrast between light and dark areas.  This is the same button you used to freeze the image before firing the transducer. Congrats! You created an ultrasound image!  , In order to save the image you took, find the save button and save the image onto a certain place on your computer for easy access later.   Patients might want a copy of their ultrasound. To to this, find the print button and send the image to a printer.  Look at the color differences.   Ultrasound is usually black and white. The white is solid tissues like bones because they reflect more light. The blacker area is less dense and can be liquids or lumen like a uterus.  Use a delicate wipe such as a tissue.   There are ultrasound tissues that you may buy which will provide minimal scratching on the head of the transducer. Wipe softly but firmly. Make sure all the gel is off before getting ready to store it.  This will help to protect anything that may accidentally fall on the head.   The top surface of the transducer is very soft and any scratch or spill might damage the quality of the image.  This includes a place that is safe from knocking the probe down.   The probe should always be cool and dry. If other people are sharing the probe, make sure they also know safe storage protocols.  

collect all the components to aquire an ultrasound image.  turn the machine on and load the software.  connect the transducer to the machine.  prepare the probe.  lightly press the transducer onto the surface of the tissue.  adjust the image.  freeze the image.  save the image.  interpret the image.  wipe the gel off of the transducer.  put the plastic cover back onto the transducer.  store in a safe place. 

 The chemotherapy is the initial part of this treatment, and it must be followed up by a stem cell transplant, which is what these cells that are frozen will be used for down the road.   You will likely receive a medication such as G-CSF (Granulating Colony Stimulating Factor) which will promote the growth of white blood cells, that can subsequently be removed and frozen. After this preparation stage is complete, you will be ready to move forward with chemotherapy.; , Therefore, using chemotherapy to target and "kill off" your white blood cells, including your T cells, can be used as a method to get rid of the cells that are at the root of the problem in MS. It is this concept that has made the idea of chemotherapy for MS potentially so promising (although it is still in the early stages so doctors have yet to see ongoing proof of its effectiveness).   Chemotherapy agents that are typically used include a combination of Etoposide, Cytarabine, Carmustine, and Melphalan, as well as an immunosuppressive agent called Thymoglobulin. The chemotherapy regimen is called "BEAM." Although chemotherapy does not technically cure MS, 18 out of 19 patients in the initial study showed either a stabilization or an improvement of their disease following treatment - so it is certainly a promising option for those who meet the eligibility requirements., However, you will be required to continue with ongoing monitoring for approximately 2 months following chemotherapy treatment for MS.   In the initial 2-month period following chemotherapy, doctors will check your cell counts and overall response to treatment to ensure that there are no complications. You will also be asked to follow up with 8 study visits over the course of the following 5 years. At these visits, doctors will examine your blood and your urine, they may do an MRI, and they will perform a neurological exam to assess your MS symptoms (and to note the hopeful improvement of your symptoms since receiving treatment). These follow up visits serve to inform you about your progress, as well as to provide the data needed for the study to determine the long-term efficacy of MS chemotherapy treatment.  This is the final stage of treatment. The hope is that the chemotherapy will have eliminated all of the damaging T cells from your white blood cell line that were responsible for the autoimmune damage of multiple sclerosis. The goal now is to replace the cells that were destroyed with healthy new cells (the ones that were frozen and will now be transplanted).   When the cells were frozen, the doctors will have removed the T cells, and frozen only healthy cells to be transplanted back into you following chemotherapy. This is what makes the treatment so effective and so promising. You will remain in hospital following the stem cell transplant until your "peripheral cell counts" (your white blood cell counts) have returned to the normal range., It is generally not used to treat mild cases of MS, due to the lack of evidence and the potential risks. If you have a severe progressive form of MS, or one with multiple relapses, this treatment may be for you.   If your form of MS qualifies for potential chemotherapy treatment, your doctor will also need to evaluate your overall health and fitness to receive the treatment. If you have a number of other medical illnesses, you may not be eligible. However, if your body is strong and healthy, you may be eligible to participate in the clinical trial and to receive chemotherapy as a treatment for your MS.  It is important to understand that chemotherapy as a treatment for MS is still in the clinical trial phase.What this means is that it is a new treatment that has only recently been tried by the medical community, and it lacks substantial long-term evidence of its effectiveness.   Normally, you would speak to your doctor to determine your eligibility to enter the clinical trial and, if you qualified, he or she would put you in contact with the physicians administering the trial. Unfortunately, the clinical trial for MS chemotherapy is not currently accepting new patients.It may or may not open again down the road for new patients. If chemotherapy treatment remains of interest to you, continue to follow up with your doctor about the status of the clinical trial to see if any new spots open down the road.  However, there have been a few case reports of people who have died from the treatment. Also, there is no long-term evidence yet as to potential implications of the treatment on your health and wellbeing down the road. It is important to be aware of the risks prior to signing up for this novel treatment.   If your condition is severe enough (i.e. if you are suffering a lot from your symptoms of MS), the benefits of trying the treatment will likely outweigh the cons. However, it is up to you to weigh the pros and cons and to determine which choice is right with you. Your doctor can provide guidance and assistance with this decision.  Whether or not the progression is able to be slowed depends on two factors:   The stage at which "disease-modifying treatment" is initiated (the earlier, the better), and The specific type of MS you have. The "relapsing-remitting" type tends to be the one which responds best to disease-modifying treatment, which in turn can slow the rate at which it progresses.  Examples of steroid medications include Prednisone and IV (intravenous) Methylprednisolone. The purpose of steroid therapy is to reduce the inflammation around the nerves, as it is an autoimmune attack of the nerves that leads to the symptoms of MS to begin with. "Another option, if steroid therapy does not help you, is plasma exchange (called "plasmapheresis"). This is when a portion of your blood (the plasma) is removed and exchanged with new plasma. The goal is that, in the exchange, the autoimmune antibodies (leading to the symptoms of MS) can be temporarily cleared from your body.  Many of these symptoms can be improved with specific medical treatment.  slow) the progression of the disease itself is to opt for disease-modifying therapies. These are most successful for the relapsing-remitting form of MS. They have unfortunately shown little utility in the other forms of MS.   Treatment options include Beta interferons, Dimethyl fumarate, Teriflunomide, Natalizumab, Glatiramer acetate, Fingolimod, Mitoxantrone, and Alemtuzumab. These treatments may have significant side effects, so it is important to discuss the pros and cons with your physician prior to initiating treatment.  

stimulate the growth of white blood cells in your bone marrow.the first thing you will need to do in order to treat ms via chemotherapy is to stimulate the growth of white blood cells so that a large enough sample can be removed from your body and stored (frozen) for use later on.  receive chemotherapy for your ms.chemotherapy is traditionally thought of as a treatment for cancer only; however, it is also effective in destroying white blood cells, and it is a certain lineage of white blood cells (called your t cells) that are responsible for the autoimmune damage in multiple sclerosis.  continue with regular monitoring following the chemotherapy.your cell counts will typically return to normal 9-14 days following the treatment.  have the stem cell transplant.once your white blood cells have been wiped out with chemotherapy, you are now ready to receive the autologous (meaning using your own cells) stem cell transplant.  determine whether you are a candidate for chemotherapy.in order to be a candidate to receive chemotherapy treatment for your ms, you need to have a form of ms with a poor prognosis (meaning a poor outlook moving forwards).  talk to your doctor about how to sign up for an ms clinical trial.  factor in the risks of ms chemotherapy treatment.over 90% of people who have received this treatment to date have suffered no serious complications from it.  learn about the various ms treatment options that are available, apart from chemotherapy.while ms cannot be cured (and medical researchers are still actively looking into the question of how best to treat it), there are several options available to treat and improve symptoms and, in some cases, to actually slow the progression of ms as well.  consider steroid treatment.regardless of which type of ms you have, and how early or late it is in the course of your disease, virtually all ms patients are offered steroids as a form of treatment.  opt for "plasma exchange.  ask your doctor about treatments for symptom management.common symptoms of ms include fatigue, trouble with bladder control, muscle stiffness and/or spasms, sensations of numbness and/or tingling, vision problems, trouble walking, problems with balance and/or coordination, and decreased cognitive function (problems with thinking, learning, and planning).  try specific "disease-modifying" therapies.as previously mentioned, the only way to actually alter (i.e. 

 A URI affects your kitten’s nose, throat, and sinuses,and pneumonia affects her lungs and airways.For both URI and pneumonia, you will probably hear your kitten coughing.The cough with pneumonia is typically deep.Kittens with pneumonia can have difficulty breathing. You may hear your kitten struggling to breathe if she has pneumonia.Sneezing and gagging are associated with URIs.; , Nasal discharge is seen with both URIs and pneumonia. The discharge is typically green or yellow with pneumonia,indicating some type of infection. With a URI, the discharge may be colored or clear.Check for nasal ulcers as well. Nasal ulcers and oral ulcers are sometimes seen with URIs., With a URI caused by a bacteria (Chlamydia),the membrane that lines your kitten’s eyelids—the conjunctiva—becomes inflamed. This is called conjunctivitis, and would cause your kitten’s eyes to look a little red. Your kitten will likely squint or rub her eyes to try to relieve the discomfort around her eyes.Discharge from the eyes can be seen with URIs.Changes to the eyes are not seen with pneumonia.  Not surprisingly, your kitten’s behavior will change when she becomes sick. For both URI and pneumonia, your kitten will probably start to become lethargic.In addition, she will eat less because the illness is dampening her appetite.She may also become depressed.These changes in behavior are not specific to either URIs or pneumonia, but generally occur during the course of an illness.  Since URIs and pneumonia are most commonly caused by some type of infectious agent (e.g., virus, bacteria), either illness will cause your kitten to develop a fever. Take her temperature by inserting a thermometer (preferably digital) into her ear or rectum.   Ear thermometers specifically made for cats and dogs are available at your local pet store, but are generally not as effective as rectal thermometers.To take her temperature rectally, first apply a lubricant (such as KY jelly) to the thermometer’s tip. Then, stick the thermometer into her rectum and wait for about two minutes, or until it beeps.Remember that your kitten is small—you will not need to insert the thermometer in very far to get a reading. A fever is a temperature over 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39.4 degrees Celsius).Your kitten may not stay still long enough for you to take her temperature. In that case, you can rely on her clinical signs to detect when she is sick and needs treatment.  When you start coughing or developing a case of the sniffles, you can go to your local pharmacy and pick up an over-the-counter medicine that will help you feel better. However, if your kitten is showing signs of a respiratory illness, take her to your veterinarian—do not try to self-diagnose her.The infectious agents that can use URIs can be quite contagious, which is a problem if you have other cats. Self-diagnosing and treating her at home could end up making your other cats sick. Depending on the severity of your kitten’s illness, she may require intensive treatment by your veterinarian to get better.Diagnosis of a URI is usually based only on clinical signs.If the URI or pneumonia is chronic, or if the initial treatment does not work well, your veterinarian may also perform other diagnostic tests (e.g., chest x-rays, blood tests, analysis of discharge)., After your veterinarian has diagnosed your kitten with a URI or pneumonia, you will need to follow the treatment recommendations to get your kitten back to good health. URIs are usually treated according to the symptoms.Your veterinarian will prescribe an antibiotic, such as tetracycline or doxycycline, if the URI has caused a secondary bacterial infection.Although pneumonia is most frequently caused by a virus,it is treated with antibiotics to treat the secondary bacterial infections. Antibiotics are usually given while other test results are pending.Pneumonia can sometimes by caused by fungi or parasites. Test results will determine if other medications will need to be prescribed.Your veterinarian will prescribe a topical medication if your kitten has discharge coming from her eyes,or has conjunctivitis., In addition to the medications, your kitten will need different types of supportive care to help her recover. For example, steam inhalation is recommended for URIs and pneumonia to keep the airways moist. Run the shower in your bathroom to create a steamy, enclosed environment. Place your cat in the steamy bathroom for about 10 to 15 minutes.Wipe the discharge from her eyes and nose with a moist tissue.To increase your kitten’s appetite, feed her a highly palatable canned cat food. Baby food might also work. If your kitten still refuses to eat, your veterinarian can prescribe an appetite stimulant.Make sure your kitten rests during her treatment.Since she will already be feeling tired, it probably won’t be hard to restrict her physical activity. If your kitten has pneumonia, try to prevent her from lying in one position for too long.If your kitten has severe pneumonia, she will need to receive supportive care at the veterinary hospital to stabilize her before you bring her home. This may include intravenous fluids and oxygen supplementation., This is applicable if your kitten has pneumonia. Your veterinarian will want to see your kitten after a few weeks of treatment. During the follow up appointment, your veterinarian will take more chest x-rays.You may need to bring your kitten in for several follow-up appointments until the x-rays are normal. When they are normal, you can stop giving your kitten the antibiotics. 

listen to your kitten.  check your kitten’s nose for discharge.  look at your kitten’s eyes.  observe your kitten’s behavior.  take your cat’s temperature.  take your kitten to your veterinarian.  administer medications.  provide supportive care.  schedule a follow-up appointment. 

 You want to make sure to remove all the hair that has built up in your hair combs during their use. This can harbor germs and dirt that can spread to your clean hair during styling. Your hair combs can also have a buildup of hair product that needs to be cleaned regularly to ensure your hair looks its best. To remove the excess hair from your hair combs, try:   Using a pen or pencil to lift the hair off the hair comb bristles. Using a comb to get in between your hair comb’s bristles. Cutting the hair with scissors if it is tangled or hard to remove from your hair comb’s bristles. ; , Using a clarifying shampoo will ensure that it cuts through the styling product residue that is on your hair combs. Baby shampoo is also effective at cleaning hair comb dirt. Use a dime size amount of shampoo or conditioner and mix well with warm water.  You want to allow your hair combs to soak to soften the bristles. This will also loosen the dirt, hair, and hair products that may be stuck on the hair comb, itself.  If it seems that your hair combs need additional cleaning, use a toothbrush to scrub the bristles and surface of the hair comb. This will allow dirt and hair products to be removed easier and will ensure you have a clean hair comb when you are finished. , Thoroughly rinse the shampoo or conditioner from the hair comb’s bristles. This will help remove any excess dirt and hair from the hair comb. You want to make sure to rinse well, so there is no shampoo or conditioner residue left on the bristles. This could make your hair greasy when used later.  Once rinsed, dry your hair combs on a towel. This will remove any excess water and keep your bristles fresh. If you have a natural bristle hair comb, leave it bristle side down on a towel to air dry overnight. , You can drain the water that is left in the sink. It may be necessary to rinse and clean your sink with a cloth to remove any lingering dirt from your hair combs. Any hair that has been left in the sink should be disposed of. Be sure not to let large hair clumps to go down the drain as this could clog your sink.  

remove the hair from your hair combs.  fill your sink with warm water and a small amount of shampoo or conditioner.  soak your hair combs for approximately 15-30 minutes.  scrub with a toothbrush to remove any dirt.  rinse brushes with warm water to remove the shampoo.  towel dry your hair combs.  drain the water left in the sink and dispose of any hair. 

 This will keep the moisture of the soil from leaching out to the terracotta jar.; , Use pebbles or similar items to do this.  The opening of the tube needs to be above the jar rim. Fill the tube with gravel.  Do this around the inserted tube, keeping it centered.   Use soil specifically labeled as suitable for strawberries. This will contain the right type of soil for the strawberries and helps them to grow well. Ensure the soil comes out into the jar's outlets where the plants will be sitting once planted.  The gravel will stay in place while the soil compacts around it.  Plant these in the various outlets of the strawberry jar.  This will ensure that they receive adequate water as it trickles through the gravel into the soil but are not overwatered. , Alternatively, place it on a patio or outdoors in the garden.  

soak the strawberry jar in water.  cover the drain holes.  place a paper tube vertically in the center of the jar.  fill the jar with soil.  take out the paper tube.  add the strawberry plants.  water the strawberry plants via the gravel at the top of the jar.  place the strawberry jar on a saucer if keeping it on a surface that cannot absorb the water or handle soil stains.  ,  place the strawberry jar in a sunny area of your home. 

 There are plenty of relatively healthy ways to craft a coffee-based beverage you enjoy drinking. For instance, try adding almond milk and cinnamon. Both of these are far healthier than sugar and dairy creamers. You can also blend coffee into a breakfast smoothies with other nutrient-rich, workout-enhancing ingredients like almond butter, banana, and whole grain oats.MCT oil and butter in your coffee can provide healthy, fat-based energy to help kick-start your day. This is especially true if drinking butter coffee prevents you from drinking a more sugary morning beverage, or from eating a carbohydrate-based breakfast.  Plain brewed coffee provides the benefits of caffeine without unnecessary additional calories. Understand that the amount of caffeine will vary widely based on the bean, the roast, the grind, and the preparation methods of your coffee. Remember that in this article, 1 ounce of coffee is assumed to have about than 10 mg of caffeine,which is on the lower end of the spectrum.Be conscious of where your coffee is coming from and how caffeine amounts vary. For instance, an 8-ounce dark roast coffee from Starbucks may contain 130 mg of caffeine, while a K-cup may contain between 75 and 150 mg of caffeine.  While packaged drinks are often conveniently labeled with the exact amount of caffeine they contain, they are often also full of sugar, sodium, or other unhealthy additives. Be sure to check the ingredients list and check the levels of sugar and sodium., Tea has a whole slew of antioxidants and even contains additional fat-burning components. Black tea usually contains more caffeine than green tea, though specific contents vary widely. Capsules are arguably the easiest and least expensive way to get your fix, but may be especially likely to make you jittery. Finally, work-out specific products such as endurance gels or strength-building supplements often contain caffeine, precisely for the benefits that the drug offers. 

doctor your coffee for flavor or enhancement.  drink black coffee.  be wary of packaged caffeinated drinks.  consider tea, caffeine pills, or workout supplements. 

 There can be several factors that will determine how long each interview will take. Once you have a complete estimate of time, you can determine how much time off to request. Factors include the following:   Drive time. Add up drive time to and from the interview and your home or office. Include time for traffic and/or detours. Type of interview. You can ask your contact what the interview will entail and the approximation of time. Knowing the approximate time it will take to interview will allow you to plan better and reduce the feeling of being rushed. Change of clothes. If you need to change out of interview clothes back into your regular work attire, this time needs to be accounted for. Also, determine where you will be making the change (your car, home, or fast-food restaurant bathroom) to help with a timeframe.; , Once you have determined how much time must be safely taken out of your work day, determine if you can complete this interview during a regularly scheduled work day. Take the following for example:   Early in the day. You can choose to take time off at the beginning of your scheduled work time. This may be a good time for you because it does not interrupt your day, and you can choose to work later than usual to complete unfinished work. Lunchtime. If your interview and drive time is short, say within an hour and a half, you can choose to interview during your lunch hour and eat your lunch in the car. If your work culture allows occasionally longer lunches, you do not have to give an excuse. If you must return to work within the given timeframe, it is best to ask for a longer lunch to take care of a personal matter. Toward the end of the day. Leaving early can be a good option because you can try to finish up your work before you are scheduled to leave. You can then focus on the interview. This also eliminates the worry of how long the interview process will take.  It may be best for you to take an entire day off when scheduling an interview. This can be done by taking a vacation day, sick day, personal day, or general PTO. Choosing to take off an entire day can be determined by assessing several factors:   How many interviews you schedule in one day. You can choose to schedule multiple interviews in one day to eliminate the need for constant time off requests. Taking a day off this way may reduce any suspicion as well. How long you estimate the interviewing process will take. As stated above, it is important to estimate the time you will need to take off. If it is more than a half of a work day, it may be best to just request a full day off. Suspicion level at your job when others take time off during the day. Every workplace is different. If you feel that you may raise unwanted suspicion because you requested a few hours off, it may be best just to schedule a whole day off.  You know your job best. Think about the slow times versus busy times, and choose a day to take some time off when you are missed the least.   For example, if Monday afternoon is your busiest time of the week, do not choose to interview on a Monday afternoon. On the contrary, if Thursday mornings are very slow, you may be able to schedule something at that time. It may even be best for you to take time out of your Friday afternoon and get a jump on your weekend plans.  After evaluating your options listed above, determine your comfort level:   Will a half of work day be best to take off? If so, what day and time are you more comfortable leaving? Should you take an entire day off instead?  

determine the timeframe of which you will be out of work.  evaluate the ease of taking time out of your work day.  assess taking an entire day off.  choose the best day of the week.  determine when and for how long you will take off of work.

 The first basic thing you have to understand is the rumor which is going around about you. The thing with rumors is that they start off as one, and can keep getting extensions from here and there. So you first need to be aware of the exact rumor that was spread.; , Analyse the fact," who are the people who could have spread this about me?" Once you are near sure of a rough set of people who could have been behind this malicious talk, do not talk to them. Ignore them. Confronting them without valid proof would only lead to more false accuses.  Discuss with them about the rumor. Ask if they are also aware of it.  When rumors spread, people expect you to act differently. And if you do act differently, people kind of start believing that yes, something going around about this person seems to be true, because she is behaving differently, after all.  And address this large collection of people. You can probably start off by saying," I have become aware of the fact that certain things are going around. I have no concerns with these things whatsoever. I have not changed at all..." Ask your friends to be around you when you do this, and you can tell people," this is what i had wanted to say, rest is upon you, how you want to see things."  , After you have clarified yourself in front of people, leave it upon them. You know what you are, your friends and family know it. Be strong, and ignore things. When people will see you alright and happy as before, they will automatically be normal themselves. People usually forget all such things after a while. Relax.  Go enjoy with your friends to take things off your mind.  

be sure of the rumor.  see through people.  talk to your friends.  be normal.  collect people around you.  cleanse your mind.  have a day out. 

 You'll want to ensure that you are establishing an environment that is ideal for your toddler to feel comfortable and happy. Even if you have set up a playdate and the other child is friendly, don’t force your child to play. You can try to encourage them by playing with them or addressing any of their immediate concerns like having to go potty, but don’t make them play if they are not in the mood., Though your toddler may be very social, remember that a lot of children have difficulty sharing. If possible, put out two of each toy so that each child can have the same item to play with. This can cut down on a lot of potential arguments or tantrums.You can also provide large toys. Your toddler will be able to share this toy with another toddler. This might be a set of building blocks or a swing set in your backyard. Consider mixing the toys altogether. Allow your children to freely play without much structure. Avoid introducing your child’s favorite toy to the mix unless they are typically a good sharer.  Group activities will give your child a chance to interact with other children. You can also help your toddler make friends by providing activities during their playdates. Perhaps you'll want to set up a mini soccer arena for them in your house or backyard, or a painting studio for them to create art.This will help even the shyest child interact more.  Most children benefit from having some outdoor time each day. Schedule your child’s playdate at a park, or consider going on a walk with the children. Your toddler will have fun and you will be able to get a bit of exercise in. 

don’t force them to play.  double up on toys.  find group activities, instead of toys they play with individually.  go to the park or on a walk. 

 Leeks, potatoes, and chicken broth are the main ingredients in this tasty soup.  Use soy milk and Brewer's yeast to substitute the traditional use of eggs in this healthy vegan dish. Just combine the leeks along with a few other ingredients, sauté them lightly, and then bake them in an oven.  Heat 2 tbsp. of olive oil on a pan and add 1/2 a clove of minced garlic after one minute. Let the garlic cook for 2-3 minutes and then add 1 bunch of diced carrots and 1 bunch of diced turnips to the mixture. Cook them for another 3-4 minutes and then add 1 bunch of diced leeks to the mixture. Cook the veggies until they're tender, for another 3-4 minutes, and then season them will salt and pepper to taste and serve them.  Heat 4 tbsp. of butter and 1 clove of minced garlic in a large skillet for 2 minutes and then add 4 diced tomatoes, 1 bunch of thinly diced leeks, 1/2 diced red onion, 1 tbsp. of pepper, 1 tbsp. of salt, and 1/2 cup of heavy cream to the pan. Continue to cook the ingredients for 5-7 minutes, until the leeks and tomatoes are tender and all of the ingredients are incorporated. Place the pasta sauce over whole wheat pasta and top it with 1/2 a cup of Jack cheese and 1/4 cup of chopped parsley.  Boil, fry, or poach the leeks and then serve them up with a simple baked salmon, broiled chicken, or tuna steak. Add mashed potatoes to this combination for a complete, healthy, and tasty meal.         

make potato leek soup.  make vegan leek quiche.  make a leek vegetable sauté.  make pasta sauce with leeks.  serve the leeks with fish or fowl. 

 You will be massaging your stomach so you want to make sure that your belly is naked. While it is not necessary for you to be completely naked, oils can stain clothing. Drape a towel over your lap to prevent spilling. If you are applying the oils to another person, have them remove clothes to their level of comfort, making sure that you are able to fully massage their abdominal area.  You need only a dab of oil to begin with. Gently dip your fingers in the oil. You only need about an ounce of oil total for a massage. As you massage, you can reapply oil as necessary.  Use your fingertips and move in slow circles at first. Apply slight pressure to the abdomen. Next move under the breast and apply pressure, massaging downward using both hands. This massage encourages the movement of waste in your body and can be executed daily as a preventative measure as well., As you massage, it is important to remember to breathe deeply. The scents should help you relax while loosening your bowels and intestines. If you are massaging another person, gently remind them to breathe throughout the massage.  Reflexology foot massages have been found to help with constipation as they can relax your body and may increase blood flow to your intestines.With specific attention to the ankle and the heel, lean back and enjoy a foot massage. Peppermint and rosemary oils are ideal for this type of massage. After the massage, put on socks or rinse your feet with water so that you do not slip.  It is generally recommended to drink plenty of water following a massage. Water hydrates your body and helps you recover from a massage. It is also important in alleviating constipation as water flushes out the colon and loosens impacted fecal matter.  If you need to go to the bathroom, end the massage immediately and go. Do not try to hold it in until the end. If you have chronic constipation, a daily massage may be able to help you stay regular, even if you are not currently feeling constipated. 

remove your clothes.  apply a small amount of oil to your hands.  gently rub oil over abdominal area.  inhale deeply.  treat your feet.  drink plenty of water.  use the toilet. 

 Look for backpacks that will be the right size for your daily needs. Using an overly large backpack will make it more likely you will overfill it.Think about how many books or electronics you need to carry.   Don’t try to carry more than 15% of your body weight. Rolling backpacks can be a great alternative if you have heavy loads.  Look for padded shoulders and try backpacks on. Two strapped bags are better than single strapped, because they distribute weight better. Try backpacks on, if not shopping online and remember the bottom should rest on the curve of your lower back.  Loose threads and careless stitching can be dead giveaways of bad quality. A backpack can give years of good use and you want to make sure your investment is durable. Inspect the fabric for any raw edges.  Backpacks come in all types and extra features can be either useful or unnecessary. If you carry a lot of small items such as pencils, keys or snacks, you may want extra pockets to easily access them. Some bags have padded pockets for computer tablets and laptops. Opt for a more basic backpack, if you don’t need these extra compartments.  Think about where you will be taking your new backpack. If you are going off to college, you may want a bag that will carry heavy books, but also show some personal style. If you’re traveling in urban areas, you will want a streamlined, modern style.These bags typically have hidden pockets that do not look bulky.  

consider day to day comfort.  find the right fit.  keep quality in mind.  think about extra features.  choose the right style. 

 If you are at least 16 years old, consider getting a small part-time job that will allow you to pick up shifts after school. A job that requires late night hours after school may not be the best job. However, there are many employers that look for teenage employees. It will also look good on your college application to maintain good grades while working a job.Grocery stores, retail stores, and restaurants frequently hire teenagers.

 If you've already traveled into the Eurozone, you're in luck — it's not usually hard to get your hands on Euros. For example, most European banks will sell Euros to non-citizens at very reasonable rates. Best of all, most banks in major European cities will have at least some staff members that speak English. If you're not comfortable awkwardly asking for an English speaker, you can always use the ATM (see below for more information).   Exchange rates at European banks tend to be quite good. Many banks will not charge a transaction fee for the service (though some will). Note that the hours of operation for banks in Europe can be different than they are abroad. Banking holidays will also vary from country to country. If possible, check when the bank is open online before making your trip.; , You can also buy Euros at most major banks in the UK, Canada, Australia, and the US. This is handy if you want to have a small amount of European currency in your wallet when you step off the plane. Some traveler's guides strongly recommend this.Others, however, favor buying Euros in Europe to avoid the risk of traveling with large amounts of currency.   Fees at banks in the English-speaking world can vary from place to place and based on whether or not you have an account. Anecdotally, American banks are said to have less-favorable dollar-to-euro exchange rates than their European counterparts., Believe it or not, many European post offices (especially in major cities) will have small "mini-banks" inside that will be able to change your money from your home country's currency to euros. Not all post offices will have these mini-banks, but the ones that do are claimed to have some of the best exchange rates available.Even some post offices in the English-speaking world will have small banks or exchange bureaus available to exchange your currency. This is by no means guaranteed, however, so check online or via phone before visiting if possible.  Since busy airports are host to thousands (sometimes millions) of passengers from around the world every day, they will usually have their own currency exchange booths and kiosks. Any of these will be happy to convert your cash into Euros — whether you're in your home country or the Eurozone.   You may want to avoid this option if you have other choices available. While airport exchanges are are convenient, according to some sources, they often have some of the least-favorable exchange rates.Note that airports that don't receive a great deal of international traffic (like smaller regional airports) may not have their own exchanges.  Some major cities and tourist locations will have currency exchanges completely separate from banks, post offices, airports, and so on. These can range from small kiosks to bank-like brick and mortar locations, depending on where you are. The most well-known currency exchange service for most Americans is Travelex, but you may be able to find other currency exchanges (also called bureaus de change) in the following locations:   At major transportation hubs (airports, train stations, etc.) Near tourist destinations/landmarks Near hotels, resorts, etc. Near commercial areas (markets, malls, etc.) If you haven't left for Europe yet, try using Travelex's store locatore here to find a currency exchange near you., It's important to note that most ATMs in Europe — those at banks and those elsewhere — will allow you to buy Euros by debiting your checking account. This can be an exceptionally convenient option since there are likely to be hundreds of ATMs in any major European city. In addition, most ATMs will operate in a variety of languages including English.   With ATMs, the fees you incur can vary greatly depending on the bank you use. Some banks may charge a "foreign transaction" fee in addition to the standard ATM fee, which can make using ATMs expensive. Thus, it is usually cheapest to make a few big withdrawals, rather than many small ones.If you intend to use ATMs in Europe, notify your bank in your home country before leaving. If not, your bank may interpret the financial transactions in Europe as fraudulent activity or identity theft.  

visit a bank in your destination country.  alternatively, visit a bank in your home country.  try a postal bank.  visit an international airport.  visit a currency exchange.  try a european atm.

 Determine what you are afraid of and challenge it.When it comes to being fearful of sex, you need to know what has caused you to be afraid. Identifying specific fears will help you focus on finding a solution.   Sit down and make a list of the things you fear about sex. For example, you may not know how to approach the subject, you might be afraid of doing something wrong, or you’re embarrassed of how you look naked. Challenge your fears by listing possible solutions to resolve your fears. For example, if you don’t know how to approach the subject with someone, ask a trusted friend how they do it, or find someone who does it well and model his behavior. Even watching a romantic movie might help. If you are afraid of doing something wrong, you need to study the subject and figure out what techniques work best for you. Preparation and knowledge will lessen any fear.; , The structure and function of the human body have been studied for centuries. There are volumes of information you can refer to if you are unaware of some or all parts of the female or male anatomy.   If your fear is related to not knowing enough about a woman’s and man’s external genitalia, then it is time to get educated.The female genitalia includes: the vagina, a tubular organ connecting the genitals with the uterus; the uterus, a hollow muscular organ where a fetus grows during pregnancy; the vulva includes all the visible external aspects (mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, urethra, vaginal vestibule, perineal body); glans, the tip of the clitoris that is a highly sensitive organ. The male genitalia includes: the penis, cylindrical mass of penile tissue; the testes, oval, glandular organs contained inside the skin pouch called the scrotum; glans, the structure at the tip of the penis. The four stages of sexual response are: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and refractory period.An orgasm is a genital reflex governed by the nerves in the spinal cord and is experienced differently by women and men.Once you understand the basic structure and function of relevant body parts, you will feel more in command of yourself and your fears about sexual activity.  Most fears are conquered by devising a plan of action. Overcoming a fear of sex is no exception. Identify what your main objectives are, set up steps to take and follow your plan.   Make a list of the things you fear. Is your fear related to the possible sexual encounter you might have during a date? Therefore, does the thought of asking someone on a date scare you? Are you concerned with looking good, having bad breath, or sweating too much? Approach your dilemma one step at a time. For example, if you are afraid to ask someone on a date, start by first asking a stranger what time it is. Although you won’t be asking the person on a date or to have a sexual encounter, you will gain experience approaching someone and asking them a question. This is the first step toward your goal. Working toward a solution will help lessen your fear. Creating a plan of action helps you feel like you can do something to improve your situation.  To overcome a fear of sex you need to gradually work your way through the process. Research indicates that overcoming a fear is aided when a person faces the fear in an imagined situation or a live experience. Developing a positive habit is the desired goal.Learn how to please yourself. Determine what feels good to you by touching yourself, imagining an interaction with someone, or using sexual accessories designed to arouse. With a willing participant, build your experience over time in the areas of communicating your feelings, holding hands, kissing, massage, sexual touching and eventually intercourse. Do not pressure yourself into doing too much too soon. This may only add to the fear you are feeling.  When communicating with someone you care about be kind and caring and show them you are emotionally open. Sex is an emotional experience, so be mindful of this when speaking and when spoken to.   If you are physically or emotionally uncomfortable in any way, tell the person you are with and take the time you need to get to a place of comfort. For example, if you feel rushed or physically ill say, “I’ve got to stop right here. I’m not comfortable.” Avoid jumping into sexual situations too quickly. The results could be dangerous. You can still be emotionally open with someone and show discretion about how far you will allow yourself to be involved.  Sexual interactions are supposed to be enjoyable so relax and engage in the excitement of it all. Focusing on having fun will distract you from being fearful.   Lightening the mood during a sexual encounter will allow you to feel free. For example, be playful and silly and laugh at yourself.It will set you both at ease.  The human body is amazing. Yours is unique and needs to be taken care of so you will have confidence with your sexual abilities. Eating right, getting an appropriate amount of sleep, and exercising will help you maintain great health and a positive sense of yourself.Certain drugsand alcohol will affect your physical functioning. Avoid them to eliminate lingering fear. If you do have difficulty getting and maintaining an erection, see a doctor who is specifically trained to manage these issues. Erectile dysfunction is usually attributed to a poor blood supply to the penis. Eating foods that promote good vascular health and following a healthy-heart related plan may help the condition. A diet high in vegetables and fruits, whole grains, fiber, lean meats, and low-fat dairy products is recommended., Placing undue pressure upon yourself does not work to your advantage. If you have a fear of not being able to perform and meet your partner’s needs, then you must adjust your mindset.   Men tend to be competitive about many things in life, which isn’t always healthy.It becomes a problem when it causes you so much stress during a sexual encounter that you are more focused on “winning” than on enjoying each other’s company. Being overly focused on winning indicates you seek high levels of external validation.Shift your thinking toward the sharing aspects of your interaction. This will move your focus from yourself to the experience itself and your partner. Don’t judge yourself. Your self-worth is not dependent upon your sexual performance. You are an entire person with many positive qualities and abilities. Don’t let one aspect of your life define you. Write a list of some of your positive attributes, and how they benefit you and the people around you.  It is a common struggle to figure out how you feel and communicate it clearly to someone. Frustration can set in when you don’t know what you feel. You may be afraid of saying the wrong thing or not saying what you really mean.   Start by writing about the feelings you are having.Writing helps to organize your thoughts about your fears and clarifies what you are feeling. Your writing doesn’t have to be perfect. The important thing to do is to pull your emotions up from your subconscious to acknowledge them, and then you can process them. If there is something you want to tell someone, rehearse it ahead of time. Visualize yourself meeting with the person and having a good conversation. Don’t feel pressured to give your feelings a label. You don’t need to give everything a perfect name in order for it to be real. Perhaps you feel a little unsteady and a bit nervous and excited, but a little nauseous at the same time. This may translate to feeling love or infatuation for someone. It can be confusing.  A woman’s primary concern when engaging in any sexual activities is her safety. Taking precautions will help alleviate your fears toward being emotionally or physically harmed. Whether you have a fear of getting pregnant, of losing your virginity, or your parents finding out, securing your safety will help manage all of them.   You have control over your body. Avoid those things that cause you to lose control like alcohol or drugs. Make sure you feel comfortable and are ready for sexual activity. Always make sure someone knows where you are when there is a potential to engage in sexual activity with someone. Guard against pregnancy by using a form of birth control. The fear of getting pregnant can motivate you to make good choices.  Competing or comparing yourself to others in a group can be dangerous. Becoming sexually active is a turning point for everyone. You must resist the pressures of trying to fit in or make someone like you by offering sexual favors.   Your sexual development is a very personal and unique part of your life. It is your experience so you must take ownership of it. Don’t allow others to negatively influence your decisions. You must learn to set boundaries with confidence, which will help fight off any fears you have.For example, someone shows you a lot of attention and you end up dating. Your affection grows for the person, but not as fast as the person would like. They say to you, “I’m really interested in a lot of people and I thought we would be having sex by this point. When are we going to have sex? Don’t you like me?” An effective response would be, “I like you a lot and I’m enjoying the fact that we are getting closer. I appreciate that you’ve been patient with me. However, my choice to have sex with you will never be something I rush into. If you need to date someone else, then I have no other choice but to let you go.”  , As a woman, or anyone, you must be clear about your intentions when faced with a possible sexual encounter. You have the ability to stop an interaction at any time. When you say, “No!” and “Stop” it means “Stop!”Look out for yourself as if you were looking out for your best friend. If you sense danger in any situation, always follow your intuition. Be comfortable with changing your plans, your mind, and those you date. Trust your instincts. The important thing to remember is you must trust the person you are with so you can make clear, well-informed decisions.  If you are avoiding sexual contact and the thought of having sex causes you to feel excessive and unreasonable anxiety or panic, you should seek help from a professional therapist. This may be signs of a phobia rather than a normal fear response.The physical symptoms of a phobia include: sweating, shaking, feeling lightheaded, and having difficulty breathing. A counselor can help you manage these symptoms and the condition. See a therapist if you have sexual abuse in your history, which may hinder your enjoyment of sexual activity. Talking with a counselor and processing those traumas will lead to a positive relationship with others.  Approaching an intimate situation with a sense of calm will stave off fear, and enhance your enjoyment.   Relaxation techniques include guided imagery, biofeedback, and breathing exercises. These will help you lower the stress and fear you feel. Use these techniques prior to interacting with someone. Guided imagery involves focusing on calming images and can be done by yourself or with help from a therapist. Biofeedback is a technique that trains you to lower your heart rate and blood pressure, which are associated with fear. Breathing exercises help to calm the nervous system associated with the fight-or-flight response, which is triggered when you feel fear.If fear takes a hold of you when you are with someone in an intimate situation, pause and take a minute to breath and tap into the relaxation skills you have learned.  Your thoughts affect your emotions. There is a tendency to overestimate the negative outcomes before you experience them, and underestimate your ability to cope with and manage a situation. These thoughts are imbalanced and need to be challenged.   For example, you are extremely nervous and afraid that you will throw up on your date when you are kissing. Challenge the thought by saying, “You cannot predict the future and you have never thrown up on anyone. If you feel nauseous excuse yourself and go to the bathroom. You can handle it.” You are stronger than you think. If you feel you lack adequate coping skills, improve them.For example, take notice of the way you effectively cope with another type of fear in your life and apply the same technique. Also, observe how someone you admire copes with difficult situations. Ask them for suggestions that you can implement. Use positive self-talk to calm your thoughts and nerves. For example, if you feel your fear, anxiety or stress increase, tell yourself, “You are fine. This is going to be fun. You are not going to be embarrassed. Have a good time.”  

face your fear.  educate yourself on human anatomy and physiology.  make a plan of action.  practice.  be open with your emotions.  remember to have fun.  address your physical functioning.  relax your expectations to improve performance.  improve your emotional vocabulary.  make sure you are safe.  don’t compare yourself to others.  assert your right to say, “no.” sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, and stalking are very serious matters.  find a therapist.  learn relaxation techniques.when everyone relaxes, everyone benefits.  challenge your negative thoughts. 

 A causative agent is any microorganism that is capable of producing an illness. These include bacteria, virus, parasites, fungi protozoa and other harmful microorganism.., This includes the environment and objects which an organism can thrive in and multiply.  This is the path or way in which a certain organism leaves the reservoir.  This is the means by which a certain infectious agent passes from the portal of exit from the reservoir to the susceptible host. It can be transmitted through four modes:   Contact Transmission – the most common mode of transmission which is divided into:  Direct contact – the infection is transferred from person to person. Indirect contact – the infection is transferred when a person comes in contact with a contaminated object.   Droplet spread – the infection is transferred through respiratory secretions that can travel up to 3 feet (0.9 m). Airborne transmission – the infection is transferred through fine particles that are suspended in the air for a prolonged period and inhaled. Vehicular transmission – the infection is transferred through articles or substances that harbour the organism until it is ingested by the host; transmission by inanimate objects such as food, water, fomites or dust. Vector-borne transmission – the infection is transferred by intermediate carriers such as mosquitoes, flea, flies and other bites from animals or insects.  This is the venue wherein the microorganism gains complete entrance into the host.  This includes a weakened human body or animals; in cases where their immune system cannot fight the microorganism, the microorganism will launch an infectious disease.  That is, altering the mode of transmission. If the person knows how to prevent it, then the likelihood of getting a communicable disease is lower.  

understand that there must be a causative agent .  know that there must be a reservoir of infection.  be aware that there must be a portal of exit.  recognize the different modes of transmission.  understand that there must be a portal of entry.  be aware that the microorganism must have a susceptible host.  know that avoiding communicable diseases is best done by breaking the chain of infection. 

 Direct sunlight enables more rapid algae growth. Help minimize algae proliferation by keeping your fountain in a shady or covered area.If a completely shaded area is not available, a partially shaded area may still help slow algae growth. Also consider placing a cover such as an umbrella or awning in the area near your fountain to help provide shade if no natural shade is available.; , Tap water and even filtered water still have natural impurities present in them. Distilled water has all of the impurities removed, which can help slow algae formation and prevent algae growth.For larger fountains, distilled water is likely impractical. However, adding a good filter where your fountain draws or recycles water may still help remove some impurities.  The best time to start using algae prevention products is right after you have set up or deep cleaned your fountain. Commercial products are available online as well as at home improvement and maintenance stores.If you are concerned about the health and safety of wildlife using your fountain, look for animal-safe products. Most products found in pet stores and hardware stores will be animal-safe, but it is important to check the labels. Common products include Algae Shield and SeaKlear. If wildlife is not a concern, such as with indoor fountains, a cap of bleach may also work as a preventative measure. Before applying an anti-algae agent to your fountain, check the manufacturer's instructions to make sure that the product you purchased will not damage your current fountain setup. Product instructions will vary by product, but often all you need to do is add product to the water on a regular basis to the running fountain.  Changing the water helps eliminate current living algae and prevents buildup in your fountain’s pump system. Completely empty your fountain of old water and allow it air dry before filling the fountain.If possible, rinse down your fountain and wipe away any buildup or residue from the fountain surface as well as any decorative features such as stones before refilling it.  The pump is responsible for cycling water through the fountain, reducing algae's ability to grow. Scrub the pump's parts with a sponge or a firm-bristled toothbrush and distilled water.If you need to open the pump in order to get at interior parts, follow the manufacturer's instructions. All pumps are different, and what works for one pump may not work for another.  The pump cannot function unless it is entirely underwater. Keep the pump submerged to keep water cycling through and prevent algae from building and growing on the surface.It is common to have to add water to your fountain for the first several days after setting it up in order to ensure the pump stays submerged.  Your fountain should receive a deep cleaning every two months. Turn off and drain the fountain and wipe it down with a fountain cleaning solution, which may be available from a speciality retailer or online, or dish soap.Opt for dish soap if you are looking for a product that is friendly for animals such as birds and small mammals that may make use of your fountain. Go over the fountain with a toothbrush to scrape off algae and other organic matter. Be sure to thoroughly rinse the fountain after using soap, as it may damage the fountain if left on its surface. Clean the fountain's tubes using pipe cleaners, such as can be found at any hardware or craft store, to scrub out the pipe interiors.  If you find that your fountain has developed noticeable algae, the first thing you need to do is thoroughly scrub the individual components of your fountain. Take your fountain apart and clean each surface using soap and hot water and allow to air dry before reassembling.Wipe down the fountain with distilled white vinegar or a solution of 1 cap of bleach per gallon of water before soaping and rinsing the fountain. Rinse bleach thoroughly.  Unlike preventative treatments, algaecides are meant to kill off existing algae growths within a fountain. Algaecides are available in home improvement stores as well as online and specialty retailers.Check the algaecide bottle to see how to properly use the product. Check the bottle to see how much product should be added to the water and at what frequency. Non-metallic algaecides work better in fountains as they are less likely to stain.  If heavy algae growth continues for extended periods in your fountain, consider replacing the pump to get better water movement and circulation. You may be able to do this yourself, or you may want to call in an expert depending upon the size of your fountain and your level of experience.Fountain pump systems can differ greatly. Check with your manufacturer to see what components your fountain requires.  

place your fountain in the shade.  use distilled water.  use a preventative product.  change your fountain water monthly.  clean your water pump.  submerge the pump.  deep clean your fountain.  scrub your fountain.  use an algaecide.  replace your pump. 

 Cave spiders are much smaller than regular spiders, and can fit through any gap a spider can fit through, however, its height is a half block. This makes them much harder to contain and fight on your own terms. Cave spiders can also track you through solid walls, so they are difficult to ambush.  Unlike regular spiders, Cave spiders have a poisonous bite. If you are poisoned, your health will deplete until you only have half of a heart left. You can heal poison by drinking milk, but this can take a while. Try to use your milk between battles.  Cave spiders can hold their breath for 16 seconds, and then die after another 6 seconds. If you can flood or bury the spiders, you should be able to kill them with relative ease.  Cave spiders are only spawned by monster spawners, so destroying the spawner will prevent more spiders from appearing.  Monster generators are often surrounded by lots of cobwebs. These will slow you down but do not affect the cave spiders' movement. Use your sword to break the cobwebs.  

beware of gaps.  heal poison attacks.  suffocate the spiders.  destroy the monster spawner.  beware of cobwebs. 

 Before you reach out to a breeder, you will want to choose a particular breed of dog to purchase. A reputable breeder will only raise one particular type of breed of dog, so identifying your preferences will automatically narrow down your contact choices.You can identify a breed that is a good fit for you by looking at the traits of the group. For example, take into account the breed’s fitness level as well as their particular grooming needs.; , Ask them if there is a particular breed that they would recommend for you. And, see if they have any recommendations regarding local breeders. Most good breeders will have a strong working relationship with a local vet, in order for their dogs to receive the best of care. This is a great way to find out about those breeders who don’t advertise their services, but do a good job.You might ask, “Do you provide care for any breeders in the area? What type of dogs do they breed and would you recommend them to me?”  , Your local dog club likely keeps a detailed list of breeders operating in their area. Get ahold of your local group by going to the American Kennel Club (AKC website) and searching for the chapter directory. The national AKC can also put you into contact with a breeder referral expert who will assess your needs a provide you with al list of vetted breeders.You can also search for a breeder using the AKC National Puppy Finder registry, located on their main website. This is a system that allows you to find breeder names by entering in your selection criteria, including breed type.  Owning a purebred dog is great and you can often find these types of dogs in shelters as well. It make take a bit of time and you may need to get an older dog, but adopting can be well worth the effort. You should also consider a mixed breed dog if you are not interested in dog competitions. Mixed breeds are often considered more healthy than their pure counterparts.The AKC actually has a paperwork process that you can follow if you’d like to register an adopted dog as a purebred one for competitive or breeding purposes. Look at the AKC website for additional details. To find a local shelter in your area, you can go to the Petfinder website. Or, you can enter your city name and “animal adoption” into a search engine.  Once you’ve got a breeder’s contact information, reach out to them as soon as you can. It may take a few attempts to finally establish contact as breeders are known for being extraordinarily busy and they spend a great deal of time outdoors. If you call, just leave a message with all of your contact details.If you leave a message, it is a good idea to tell the breeder how you found out about them. They may be more likely to call you back quickly if you found them via a professional contact, such as a vet. In your opening statements, you may also want to make it clear that you are not interested in just any purebred dog, but that you are looking for one that meets particular requirements regarding lineage and care. You might say, “I’m trying to find a Pomeranian breeder who manages the breeding process from start to finish.”  , After you’ve passed the introductory phase, you should head into a conversation about the breeder’s background and professional credentials. Ask if they belong to any dog organizations. Verify that they have a breed specialty and ask how long they’ve been in business.It is also a good idea to ask how long they’ve been in business at the same location. Some bad breeders move their operations multiple times in order to cover up animal cruelty investigations or simply bad reputations. You can also ask a breeder why they choose to breed dogs instead of simply owning them. Many breeders will express their passion for the breed and their desire to participate in the upkeep of pure bloodlines.  A good breeder will raise only a handful of litters a year, in order to give their full attention to each puppy. Ask them how many successful placements they’ve made and how they determine the mating pairings. Ask how many puppy they’ve had returned as well for health or behavioral issues.  A good breeder should be in love with that particular breed of dog and more than willing to tell you anything and everything about its characteristics. You can inquire about the type of grooming care that the breed needs or perhaps even what type of food they would recommend. If you have a family, you might discuss how well the breed does interacting with a number of people in a home setting., You are buying the breed, but you are also buying a single puppy with a unique personality. Talk with the breeder about whether or not they raise the puppies in-house or purchase them elsewhere. The best breeders do everything themselves. In your conversation, the breeder will likely mention a particular litter that they think will fit your needs.If the breeder offers to place you on a waitlist pending the next litter, this is a good thing. It means that your breeder is in demand, but not overbreeding. Agree to be placed on the list, but ask for a time estimate.Most dog breeders will allow you to take home your puppy when it is between 8-12 weeks old. This allows time for socialization., Good dog breeders will always offer specific documentation showing that the puppy you’ll adopt is healthy both in a general sense and genetically. The documentation will be breed-specific and from a regulatory agency, such as the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals., Your puppy purchase is an investment with long-term consequences and, as such, you should ask the breeder to provide a set of personal and professional references. They may put you into contact with their vet, prior buyers, or even fellow breeders. Make sure to contact these people asap as you go through the buying process., Just as you are curious about them, you should expect that the breeder will want to know a great deal about you. They will likely inquire about your home environment. They may ask about your lifestyle and whether or not you have the time to devote to dog care. Be as honest as you can and give detailed answers to move the process along., You may be lucky and find a local breeder. But, even if your breeder lives a distance away, you should personally visit their facility at least one time, preferably more. Good breeders will welcome this opportunity and will work with you to set arrangements shortly after your first conversation.Keep your travel costs and your schedule in mind when you first contact the breeder. You want to be able to make a quick decision if they offer you a visit. Some breeders welcome family visits as well. If you are adopting the puppy into a family, this is an important moment to see how the puppy, and breed in general, interacts with your child or partner., From the moment you arrive, try to observe as much as you can about your surroundings. Pay particular attention to the boarding facility itself. Note the cleanliness of the lodgings and their appearance overall. Look to see if there is room for the dogs to play and comfortable areas for them to sleep.No kennel is spotless. A little dirt is to be expected. However, the presence of general refuse, trash, or feces are not signs of a good facility. Check the cleanliness of the food and water bowls., You should be given the opportunity to see the dogs in general, and your potential puppy more specifically. Try to play with the dogs to see how they interact. Look at their overall appearance to get an idea of their health. Do they appear well socialized? Do you see weeping eyes (a sign of sickness)? 

decide on a particular breed of dog.  discuss the process with your vet.  get a kennel club reference.  consider adopting or rescuing a dog.  get ahold of them via phone or email.  inquire about the breeder’s experience.  ask about their breeding process.  get them to tell you all about the breed.  discuss the particular litter or puppy.  go over any health certifications.  request at least three references.  pass through an interview process.  request at least one visit to their kennel.  pay attention to the status of the facility.  pay attention to the status of the dogs.

 If the framing for the building will be 2x6, allowing fewer members and deeper insulation, you will need a 2x6 sill plate. Since sill plates have an indoor application, 'pressure treated' wood is not necessary. For almost half the cost you can get a termite-treated board called 'borate'. It's apple-green, but will eventually weather to gray.; , The sun will warp and twist your boards all over the place - especially something as wet as borate. ,, Typically, sill plates are laid flush with the outside edge of the stem wall or slab. This is so water will not collect on an exposed lip of concrete and migrates into the dwelling. However, if it seems counterintuitive to you to put the full weight of the building on the outside of the stem wall, rather than the center of it, just make sure the sheathing and siding that goes on above will fully overlap the foundation.  Marker is better than pen, because it's awkward to draw around the bolt at this angle, and a marker will give you a nice line to follow.  Go a little bigger with the holes. If the bolts are 1/2", drill a 5/8" hole. This will make it far easier to get the board down over the bolts. Washers beneath the nuts will cover any gaps.  This is a strip of foam that goes down beneath the sill plate. It makes a better seal and provides insulation, and further protects the board. The foam is cut to fit and pressed down over the bolts. 'Seam sealer' is inexpensive - a 50' roll will be around $4 - $5.  As long as you left exposed at least 2 1/2" of J bolt above the block, or your boards happen to be perfectly flat, the bolts should stick up beyond the sill plate enough to get the washer and nut on. However, if your boards are warped, you're going to have to weigh down the board on either side of the bolt.  A flathead screwdriver will do the job.  Since treated wood is wet, don't over tighten. It's easy to start grinding down into the board. Tighten it so it's hard to screw down any further, but it's not driving down into the wood. 

order your wood.  cover the wood with a tarp.  measure the distance for the sill plate with a tape measure.  ,  cut the length of board - use a handsaw or a circular saw.  ,  place the cut board into position on top of the j bolts.  get the board secure (have someone hold one end of the board, or prop it up with objects), and use a marker to trace around the top of the bolts beneath the board.  drill the holes for the bolts.  lay down seam sealer.  install the board down over the bolts.  gouge around the bolt into the board if you still can't get the nut on.  tighten the nuts down over the washers and board.  here the board is installed, and you can see the roll of seam sealer beside it:  

 Have them write down the password and keep it in a safe place where you DON'T know where it is.  Until you are under the time, it will shorten and will stop as late as 15 minutes per day. After a week of perfect under the time, you can recover 15 minutes. This will stop at 2 hours. Then after 2 weeks, will go up one hour. Your goal is to stay under 2 hours with the hour wiggle room. After 2-4 months of having a close to perfect record, (1-3 times) you can get rid of the parental controls for good. This should keep you under 2 hours of phone time now.  

have your child, or spouse create a password for parental controls so you don't have more than 2 hours a day to be on it.  if you don't comply and you run out of time before you get home from work, then have them shorten the time by 10 minutes every week. 

 Using the extract-o blade, slit and cut open the front face of the box. Cut open the top to fit the fan, it should be just a bit smaller than the fan itself. Then slit the sides and back. Finally, cut open the bottom of the box, making the cut bigger than the plastic container. ,, This should resemble a 'window', making it easy to see when the tornado starts.  Ensure the nearby slot is open so air can flow through it.  This is optional but it makes it easier to see the demonstration and tornado.,, The breeze should be blowing up. ,,,, The fan air forces out of the chamber. The air from outside the box is forced in through the slits on the sides, which creates a vortex or spiral of air because the air is taken out of the box. Real tornadoes form in a similar way by using and creating updrafts and wind-shear, when wind is from different directions.  

cut and slit open different areas of the paper box.paint the inside of the box using black paint.allow the box to fully dry for about an hour.  hot glue or tape the clear plastic on the front of the box.  attach the tap-light on the inside of the top of the box near the fan opening.turn on the battery powered light if you have attached it on the box.  place the fan onto the top of the box and turn it on.place small chunks of the dry ice into the plastic container.pour the warm water over the dry ice.place the tornado chamber over the plastic container.  understand how it works and enjoy. 

 This is probably the only universal rule of fashion. Wearing perfectly fitted clothing makes you appear more put together and mature, even if you're just wearing a T-shirt and jeans. If you have unique proportions that make shopping difficult, try bringing your clothes to a tailor for alterations., Wearing clothing inappropriate for a situation may make you appear unprepared or foolish. You may not be the type of guy who wears a suit every day; just make sure you own one for when you're expected to wear it.   For more formal occasions like a job interview or wedding, stick to a dark matching suit. Your dress shirt and tie can be colorful as long as they don't clash or look tacky.Business casual is a happy medium for when you want to look sharp without overdoing it. Wear a collared shirt, slacks, and dress shoes. Pair with a blazer for a smarter look or a sweater. Ties are optional. This is a good look for networking events, evening parties, and first dates.Casual wear covers just about everything else, such as the classic T-shirt and jeans look. This can be your day-to-day style. Cities with warmer climates may be more lax with dress codes. Nobody wants to wear a dark suit and jacket in extreme weather. If you aren't sure what to wear to an event, ask other men who will be there what they plan on wearing. If you're going to a restaurant or venue, try figuring out what's expected by looking up photos of the establishment online.  No matter how much or how little you spend on your wardrobe, taking care of your clothing will keep them looking better for longer.   Learn how to sew to be able to make minor repairs on the fly. If you really can't stitch, have someone who can mend minor damage before it becomes major. Iron your dress shirts. Wrinkles make you look sloppy. Find a good local cleaner. Some types of clothing you shouldn't do yourself. A professional will know how to remove tough stains and get your clothes looking great again.Avoid wearing clothes with stains and holes in them.  

wear clothing that fits.  dress for the occasion.  keep your clothes in good condition. 

 Buy a bottle of conditioning oil to use on your glove. Squirt a dime-sized amount of the oil into a washcloth or applicator sponge and rub it into the palm area, fingers and stitching of the glove. Glove oils serve to soften the leather, and, once they’ve had a chance to set in, can protect it from hard impacts, dirt, scrapes and other elements of hard play.It’s important to treat the stitching and webbing of the glove with oil, as these parts absorb most of the strain from catching and gripping and need to be pliable. Go easy on the oil. Use just enough to lightly coat the glove, and wipe away any excess oil that’s beading up on the leather. Too much oil can oversaturate the leather, making it heavy and susceptible to cracking., Place a softball firmly in the pocket of the glove, fold the glove around the ball and then secure it with thick rubber bands, twine or a set of unused shoelaces. Stretch or tie the bands in an “X” shape so that the glove is constricted at both the top, near the fingers, and bottom, at the base of the palm. Store the glove overnight, letting it rest around the ball. With time, the glove will relax and begin to take the shape of the ball.Since you’re breaking in a softball glove, make sure you don’t wrap the glove using anything smaller than a regulation size softball.  If you don’t have anyone to play catch with, and don’t feel like slapping a ball into the glove repeatedly on your own, you can use a ball mallet, baseball bat or other similarly shaped object to simulate the impact of the ball. Use the striking surface to beat the glove in the center of the palm and in the space between the thumb and forefinger where the ball will rest. Oil the glove when you’re not using it to safeguard it against continual impact.In professional baseball, this is known as “manhandling,” and can be used to break in new gloves or keep them supple between games.Grip the striking implement firmly as you make impact to get used to squeezing around an object, the way you would when catching a ball. This will also give the stitching a bit of stretch.  Anytime you’re not using the glove for games or practice, place a full-sized softball in the pocket and stash it away. If you make a habit of this, the glove will eventually conform permanently around the ball. This is a basic way to break in a new glove, but doubles as a form of maintenance, as the leather of a glove tends to change shape and texture over time.You can choose whether to wrap the glove and ball with bands when you put it away. Once the glove is mostly broken in, there won’t be much of a need to wrap it anymore. Just keeping a ball in the pocket will be enough to help it hold its shape.  

apply oil to soften the glove.  wrap the glove tightly with a band.  strike the glove with a mallet or bat.  leave a ball in the glove when you’re not using it.

 This is a bacterium that is known to kill cutworms, and it's widely available in garden supply stores. It's a natural way to get rid of cutworms without causing harm to plants or animals. Apply it to the soil in the affected area.   This bacterium harms other types of moths and butterflies, so if you don't want to hurt any other types of insects, use a different method. Spray pesticides in the afternoon for best results against cutworms. Since they feed after dark, you want the pesticide to be freshly applied when they come to dinner. Reapply the pesticide after each rain until the plants are large enough to be safe from the worms.  This is a natural powder made from ground up fossils that can be sprinkled around the affected area. It isn't harmful to humans, plants or animals, but it kills insects that walk over it by piercing them and causing them dehydrate. Be sure not to apply this to areas where you want to promote a healthy insect population.   Apply the powder around the base of any plants where you suspect cutworm activity. You can apply with a bulb applicator to avoid getting it in your eyes or inhaling it, as this may cause irritation. Try ground up eggshells or coffee grounds as an alternative.  Cutworms love to eat cornmeal, but it hurts their digestive system. Many will overeat it to the point of killing themselves. Sprinkle some in the affected area of your garden. Just don't overdo it, or you may draw other pests., If you mix molasses with sawdust and wheat bran, you'll create a thick paste that can be painted in circles around the plants in the area where cutworms hang out. When they crawl over the molasses mixture, it will get stuck to their bodies and prevent them from ruining your plants. 

apply bacillus thuringiensis in your garden.  try diatomaceous earth.  use cornmeal.  make a molasses treatment. 

 As you breathe in, drag your right knee near to your chest, keeping your left leg on the ground so it is straight.  Breathe and hold this position for just ten seconds. While you are reading this you might think this is short, but when you are performing this yoga posture it will seem a lot longer.  Follow this up by hugging both of your knees to your chest for another ten seconds to finish the set. Keep repeating this set as long as you wish.         

lie down on your back.  push your shoulders and the back-side of your neck into the ground while at the same time holding your knee.  repeat the first two steps with the other leg. 

 Straight up, starting a new life doesn't happen overnight. It could take years. You'll probably be making such constant small progress that you won't even notice. Imagine losing 1/16th of a pound a day. You're not going to be able to tell for a long time -- but one day your clothes will be far, far too big.   By the time you do notice, you'll probably be so awesome, happy, and content that rock bottom seems like it barely ever existed. Until the moment comes when you wake up and realize, "Crap. That used to be me, didn't it?" take your time. It'll come. It always does. It's always darkest before the dawn, remember?  , This is another way of saying, "Slow down before the speed bumps." There are going to be times when you're about to lose it -- when you feel on the cusp of falling back to where you used to be, only worse (is there a worse than rock bottom?). It's these times when focusing, staying positive, and realizing this is totally normal are absolutely mandatory.   You're striking a serious balancing act between your old life and your new life right now, and that can get pretty daunting. No one expects you to do it with your hands tied behind your back and one eye closed. In fact, we expect you to lean on us for support. That's what we're here for. Though the transitions will be messy, know that they're only temporary. Focus and you'll get through them.  You're on the up and up. Fan-fricking-tastic. Now it's time to find something new. Something fulfilling. Something to drive you. Something to keep those demons at bay. What does your mind immediately jump to? Any passion will do as long as you're passionate about it. It'll take up your time, use your creativity, and give you purpose. All wonderful, wonderful things.   Being truly good at something is so rewarding. Being truly good at something you really, really enjoy is even more rewarding. Cultivating a passion, regardless of what it is, can do great things for your sense of self. You'll get so well-established that rock bottom isn't a place on your map anymore. It got erased.  Now that you have all these new ideas that are fresh and exciting, you've gotta stabilize and make them just part of your everyday world. It might take a few weeks, but balancing work, a social life, your passions, and free time will eventually all fall into place. There's no reason it shouldn't.   The good news here is that the routine will help shape itself. As long as you keep your priorities in line (taking care of your body and your mind, like we covered), it'll fall into place.  

be patient with yourself.  focus during the transitions.  cultivate a passion.  get into a satisfying routine. 

 Driving should be done with clothing that doesn’t limit the driver. In the winter, coats can interfere with proper steering as well as with proper adjustment of the seat and the operation of seat belts. Choose light and comfortable clothes.   Footwear is obligatory. The shoes have to be placed snugly on the feet (unlike slippers) and fit nicely on the pedals (unlike boots, muddy soles, or high heels). A shoe with a thin but slightly dense sole is ideal. The driver is also advised to wear a set of pants that run all the way down to the knee, even if it means wearing a set of pants over shorts or a swim-suit.; , Make sure you sit straight and that your buttocks and back are square and completely squeezed into the seat. This helps to avoid backaches, possible back injuries and maintains awareness during long drives.  The seat should always be positioned with regard to the pedals. Press the brake pedal fully with your right foot and fully depress the clutch (in a manual transmission car) or dead pedal (in an automatic). The distance should be adjusted so that with fully depressed pedals, your knees remain slightly bent (about 120 degrees).   To make sure your check is accurate, start the engine and press on the brakes a few times before performing the check to build up pressure. If the knee straightens, you are too far back. If it's bent close to 90 degrees, it's too close. A fully extended leg results in the knee locking-up. This reduces the leverage and feel of the pedals, increases effort, and puts you in risk of severe injuries to the feet in a collision;the straight knee will be fractured whereas the bent knee would fold down. Furthermore, the bone would project the shock up to the pelvic and lower spine. A knee excessively bent (when the driver sits too close) at an angle of about 100 degrees, does not support the body effectively and results in bad blood circulation. It can also hit the under-dash in a collision. The thighs should be placed as far apart as is comfortable. In small cars, most people can create a wide enough base as to lean their knees against the center console on one side and the door on the other. The feet should be placed with the heels on the floor and the balls of the feet pressing against the pedals. The right foot in particular should be able to pivot between the throttle and brake pedal while the heel is placed roughly in front of the brakes. This might mean that you don't cover the brake pedal fully when pressing it and that pressing the throttle is done with the foot at an angle, contacting the pedal close to its lower edge. This is the correct way to utilize the feet. The left foot should be resting over the dead-pedal whenever not working on the clutch (or, in an automatic, at all times). This increases support to the pelvis and allows the driver to brace the body by applying pressure against the footrest in corners or in events of strong braking instead of hanging onto the pedals or steering.  This should be as parallel as possible to the steering. It is impossible to reach a perfect adjustment (and it's also not really necessary), but by adjusting the rake of the seat to an upright angle of about 110-95 degrees, we can reach a suitable adjustment.   We cannot reach a perfect adjustment because placing the seat too upright will put pressure on the lower vertebrae, place our head too high, and because the steering itself is placed in an angle. We can adjust the seat back to a relatively upright position and then use the adjustment of the steering itself to place it as parallel to the back as possible. After adjusting the seat, including the height and the adjustments to the steering itself (below), we check the adjustment in the following manner: We place the wrist of our hand just over the topmost portion of the wheel. We should be able to place the wrist flat over the wheel and even bend it somewhat over the rim, while still keeping the shoulders (shoulder-blades) against the seat's back. This should be done with the arm straight but without putting in excessive effort.  If our wrist only touches the face of the wheel (rather than be placed flat over it), or it we can only put the heel of the palm on the wheel, or if we need to lean our scapulae (shoulder-blades) forward -- we are too far back. This will make us lean forward somewhat when we steer. If we can touch the top of the wheel with our forearm or touch the top of the wheel with the wrist with the hand bent, we are too close to the wheel. In vehicles with large, horizontal steering rims (mainly trucks), we cannot reach such a posture and we just need to check that we can grip the topmost portion of the wheel without locking the elbow fully and without bouncing the scapulae forward.  Where adjustable, the steering height should be adjusted to as parallel to back angle, and to a clear view of the dashboard through the rim. The ideal adjustment should also allow us to grip the wheel properly (at 9 and 3, see below), with our palms just lower than our shoulders.  Where adjustable, this should be adjusted with the steering wheel height, to as parallel to the back as possible. While gripping the wheel properly, our elbows should be bent at about 120 degrees. There should be a minimal clearance of 10" (and preferably 30cm) between the center of the steering hub and the base of the breastbone (sternum). It should also not be further away that 45 centimeter (17.7 in).  This should allow us to see forward clearly, while still having a clear view of the dashboard, and proper height relative to the wheel and pedals. In most cars, the proper height for forward vision should allow us to place five fingers (a hand width) between our head and the ceiling.   In cars with open or high ceiling, adjust so that you eyes are placed just above the center of the glass, without the visor obstructing your forward vision when open. After readjusting the height, recheck the feet to make sure the height adjust had not compromised it.  Place the headrest to a height just above your eyelids, and (more importantly) -- as close to the head as possible (2-3cm). A head-restraint further than 7 centimeter (2.8 in) increases the risk of whiplash. Keep in mind that while driving our head bends forward a bit more. If you cannot adjust the head-restraint to the proper distance, you need to compensate by increasing the backrest tilt.    Lumbar support: Should provide equal pressure across the whole length of the back. For drivers with lumbar problems without such an adjustment, you can use one or two rolled towels. Side Bolsters: Should be adjusted for the maximum possible hip support without limiting the ability to depress all pedals fully. Seat base reclining: Should keep the thigh in full contact with the seat. Avoid too much reclining which will create pressure behind your knees, or interfere with strong braking (you should not apply pressure against the seat). Pedal adjustments: Should allow operation of the pedals as described above as comfortably as possible. You should be able to place your heel roughly in front of the brakes, place your foot on the brakes with the slightest possible offset to the right, and pivot as easily as possible towards the throttle pedal on the right, while keeping your knee bent at about 100 degrees.  Your hands should both be on the wheel, at the 9 and 3 position. This increases the leverage on the wheel to a maximum. Your palms should be placed against the outer diameter of the wheel and the thumbs should be lightly hooked on the cross-brace of the wheel.   Grip and stabilize the wheel not only with the thumbs and/or palms, but mainly with your fingers and fingertips. In general, keep the grip of the wheel as light as possible without losing your control over the wheel. This results in better control and less fatigue. Keep both hands on the wheel. Steering with one hand makes the weight of the hand work on the wheel, for which the shoulder muscles must be used to keep the wheel steady, resulting in a twist of the spine, especially if you get into the (bad) habit of holding the wheel from its top.  Adjust the lap-belt as snugly as possible over the waist. The belt should be physically tightened and placed as low as possible, on the pelvic bones, rather than the soft belly.   The shoulder strap should be adjusted to the height, so that the mounting is higher than the shoulder, and that the strap itself is placed over the acromion (middle of the shoulder), which is felt as a socket midway between the arm and neck. If the shoulder strap is placed on the neck or even on the collar bone (clavicle), it is too high and will cause fractures to the clavicle and cuts the neck. If the strap is placed too low on the shoulder itself or on the arm/under the armpit, it will not support the body and cause severe cuts to the arm. All passengers should be strapped, and little children need to be harnessed in the suitable child seats and boosters. There are also special straps for pets. There are also other points that are worthwhile for the passengers:  Head restraint adjustment Window adjustment Proper placing of limbs relative to airbags: Avoid placing feet over the passenger's airbag or placing hands in the way of the lateral or curtain airbags, etc... Proper distance from the dashboard Full and erected seating: Full contact of the back and the seat, and an erected rake angle for the front passenger, to avoid "submarining under the lap belt. Awareness: Falling asleep is dangerous for passengers. The front passenger should be awake to monitor and assist the driver, and to avoid acute abdominal injuries in a collision, which are intensified when the person is asleep.   Not all seats of the car are equally safe. The middle-rear seat is considered safest, followed by the seat behind front passenger seat, then the seat behind the driver, the front passenger seat and the driver being in the greatest threat. This division changes in cars with additional seats (minivans) or when the middle-back lacks a diagonal or adjustable belt or a head-restraint.  With this position, your eyes will be placed in front of the center or upper half of the glass for improved visibility. Keep your eyes relaxed rather than trying and focus, and keep the eyes up rather than down. You will see more and further away, while still being aware of your surrounding with your peripheral vision.   Adjust your mirrors to give you a broad field of vision to the rear and sides (see in links below) at the glance of an eye or a slight tilt of the head (if you have a narrow field of vision due to illness or age). In some cars, you might also need to be ready to lean slightly forward or take a slight peek to the side ("Shoulder check") to make sure you see everything around while driving.  Do not keep anything around the driver's seat, because it might slip under the pedals.   In general, anything not stock is not wanted: A convex mirror mounted on the center mirror, a padded cover of the steering wheel, things dangling about on your rear-view mirror -- these are all bad things that can also prove hazardous in an accident. Windows, in this respect, are best either completely closed, slightly opened or almost fully opened, rather than half-way down, in which case the head of the driver or one of the passengers might hit it. Always keep one of your front windows slightly opened for fresh air. Open windows on highways can create drag that impairs fuel consumption and even the stability of the car, so it's best to only keep one or two windows slightly opened at most. On rugged terrain, the windows should be fully closed or fully opened to avoid rocking the window's bushings. Windows, lights and spectacles should be kept clean.    While it is possible to fit a quality, vacuum-adhesive interior mirror to view the back seat, in long drives with the whole family, it's best for the front passenger to be the one in charge of the inside of the car, and for the driver to focus himself on the road. Do not adjust your stock interior mirror to see the back seat and do not use wide-angle convex mirrors as well. Likewise, avoid placing a child in the front seat, regardless of child restraints or airbags.  It's better to use the car heat in the winter instead of driving with heavy clothing that interferes with steering and with the function of the seat belt. Keep one window slightly open for fresh air both in the summer (for oxygen) and winter (for fresh cold air).   The air conditioning is there to be used -- open the A/C periodically, even in the winter, and open the heating periodically -- even in the summer -- to ensure proper mechanical function of the two over time. A/C air recirculation is very efficient because is blows large amounts of air. However, you need some fresh air through the driver's window. Likewise, if the windscreen is very heavily misted, opening the A/C for fresh air (along with an open window) can do better. Using external circulation is also efficient when you try to cool down a very hot cabin before entering it. The A/C can also clear out bad smells. A few minutes before you turn off the car, close the air conditioner and air circulation, but keep the fan blowing air. This will channel out waste in the air ducts via a little hose inside it. Likewise, in a hot summer day, it's worthwhile to keep the heating blowing full time with all windows and doors open, to refresh the cabin. The heating is also a good choice for when the engine starts to overheat. In highways, stopping on the hard-shoulder is so perilous that it is better to keep on driving towards a safe stopping place, even in the price of causing damage to the car (like overheating the engine). Using the heating to disperse engine heat can help reaching a safe stopping place without the engine reaching critical levels of heat.  

wear proper clothing.  position yourself correctly in the seat itself.  adjust the seat distance.  adjust the rake of the seat.  adjust the steering height.  adjust the steering distance.  adjust the seat height.  adjust the head restraints.  make additional adjustments as necessary.  position your hands properly.  wear your seat belt properly.  check your visibility.  keep objects in the car low, on the floor, preferably at the front seat.  adjust your rear-view mirrors to a minimal overlap and maximal visibility.  use the air-conditioning to demist fumes on the windshields, and to provide a comfortable environment. 

 One of the best defenses for preventing or alleviating constipation during pregnancy is ensuring you're eating a high fiber diet.   Women should aim for at least 25 g of fiber every day.Track your fiber intake with a food journal or app to see how close you are to that goal. Fiber helps prevent constipation in two ways. It helps make your stool softer which can make it easier to go in addition to increasing the speed of your GI system.The best high fiber foods include: vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, lentils, and starchy vegetables. If you're not currently eating a very high fiber diet, suddenly increasing your fiber intake can cause stomach aches or other gastrointestinal issues.Slowly increase your fiber intake by a few grams over the course of several days.; , Many people know the importance of drinking adequate fluid and constipation prevention. This is also especially important during pregnancy.   When you're dehydrated, your body withdraws fluid from your colon, making your stools harder and more difficult to pass. This is a common reason for constipation.When you're pregnant you'll need more fluids each day to help support your growing baby. Most professionals recommend going for 12-13 glasses of water daily. Each glass should be 8 oz.If plain water isn't your thing, try some of these flavorful substitutes: flavored sparkling water, decaf coffee and tea, flavored plain waters, and even low-fat milk (contains about 7 oz of water per 8 oz glass).

For example, you could try saying, “I’m going to need your help maintaining a positive attitude after my diagnosis.” Let them know specific ways that they can support you. For instance, you might say, “I could really use your help getting organized. It’ll help reduce my stress to know everything is in order.” Also, when people offer to help you, be sure to say “Yes, I will take you up on that offer,” instead of simply saying “thank you.” It is important to let people know that you do want their help, even if you cannot think of how they can help you right now.

 This opens doors to people believing that they are close enough to know why you can't come. Unless you really want to have a strong, close friendship with this/these person/people, do not ever tell them why! This also sounds like you had to come up with some sort of reason not to come.   Here is an example email invite and decline:   Invite: "Tracey, How have you been? I am very excited about the upcoming ballet recital. We hope to see you there! I was thinking that it would be fun to get together sometime at my house. Let me know what days work for you. Thursday, Friday, and the 7th work for us. Let me know if you have any other days also! Jenny"  Decline: "Hello, Jenny! I'm looking forward to the recital also. Lilly is dragging me from store to store trying to find purple tights and green leotards! Hard to find! Thank you for the invitation. I am sorry, but I cannot make it. I really appreciate the offer I look forward to seeing Janice perform on Tuesday! How is your father-in-law's shoulder? We are all praying for him! Have a good weekend! Tracey"    

do not ever explain yourself over the e-mail! 

  Try not to swear or do anything unhygienic in public.  Always say please and thank you, and greet your elders.  Don't get to obnoxious when around strangers, just say a simple and polite "Hi."  When eating dinner with others, make sure to keep clean and not make a huge mess after you're finished.  Stay somewhat reserved and conservative.; ,  Reading is very classy and helps you expand your vocabulary and learn more stuff.  Make it a goal to read at least 2 books a month.  Always strive to get good grades in school.  Listen to the teacher, take short but effective notes, ask questions (this does not make you seem unintelligent), and always do your homework.   Slang words and curse words are not polite nor classy.  You don't have to use extremely complicated words for every sentence, but it's good to know some classic language that most don't use nowadays.  You can do this by reading and listening to people who have a wide vocabulary talk.   Don't talk about partying, drugs, smoking, or anything rebellious.  Talk about casual stuff like homework, what you're doing next week, what books you've been reading/what music you've been listening to, etc.  Be a good listener and make eye contact.  Try to listen more than you talk.   Classy people are intelligent and elegant, but they aren't unapproachable or arrogant. Learn when to stand up for yourself or others and be assertive, but never be bossy or rude. Avoid people who say bad things about you and avoid disloyal friends.  Always offer honest compliments and smile, and offer to do favours with nothing in return.

 Emotions help you adapt and survive as you navigate an ever-changing world. Emotions alert you, prompting you to pay attention to the situation at hand. Uncomfortable emotions like fear, anger, sadness, or anxiety help humans address threats, social situations, and loss. Anxiety, for example, can serve the purpose of preparing for a future threat. By understanding your emotions at a core level, you can begin to manage them as situations arise and use them to your benefit., Putting a name to how you are feeling is the first step toward controlling your emotions and putting them to use in your life. You may be feeling anxious, elated, overwhelmed, or angry. Identifying your emotions is a healthy exercise that can be accomplished alone or with the help of a close friend or family member.   Try writing about your emotions in a journal. Talk with a trusted co-worker about your job frustrations. This can help you gain perspective on why you are feeling a certain way.  Emotions don’t usually come out of nowhere. When you feel an emotion, you are probably responding to something in your environment, relationships, or something else. Take a moment to think about where the emotion might be coming from.For example, if you are feeling sad, then think about what might have caused this emotion. It might have something to do with your long day, a friend not returning your phone call, or the anniversary of a family member’s death. Keep in mind that an emotion may pop up well after the cause. For example, if you get frustrated by something your boss says to you at work, then you might not feel anger right away. You might feel the full force of your anger later in the evening after stubbing your toe on a table leg.  Understand that humans feel a wide range of emotions each and every day. Some feel awesome, while others do not. Negative emotions serve important purposes in your daily life, as do more positive emotions. Accepting that you will not always feel happy and that not-so-pleasant emotions are part of the human experience will help you learn to accept your emotions for what they are.For example, when you feel sad or angry, understand there is nothing wrong with you. Try telling yourself, "I accept that I am angry. This is a normal human emotion."  , It’s not easy to feel painful emotions, and oftentimes humans try to avoid feeling them. Ignoring or dismissing emotions, or numbing them with food, alcohol, or television can be destructive. Practice sitting with negative emotions instead of fighting the pain. This will help you harness these feelings and use your emotions to learn more about yourself, your situation, and how you can address any given situation.Try using a journal to write about your painful emotions. This activity can help you release tension and get to the root of your feelings. Let yourself have a long, hard cry. Crying is a great way to allow yourself to sit with emotions like grief, sadness, and pain. You may find you feel a sense of relief after crying, or may gain a new perspective on your situation.  

understand the purpose of your emotions.  identify the emotion you are feeling.  attribute the emotion to something.  accept your emotions.  learn to sit with painful emotions. 

 This method is best for dry, coarse, or tight curls. These types of hair are not well-suited to dry detangling. Dry hair will be prone to breakage, and tightly curled or coiled hair needs extra moisture to properly detangle. Water breaks down the bonds in your hair, making it weaker, more fragile, and more malleable.Condition your hair after you take out braids. If you have had your hair in braids for a while, do not comb through your hair when it’s dry. Use the wet conditioner method to detangle your hair. This will ensure that you do not yank out hair. Brushing dry, curly hair can make it frizzy and even more knotted.; , This method can work well if you have loose curls or thicker, heavier hair. You will use your fingers, a wide-mouthed comb, or a paddle brush to work through the tangles and smooth out your hair. Even if you plan to wet detangle your hair, try to dry detangle as much of your hair as you can to make the job easier.In general, hair is easier to detangle when it is dry. Dry hair is stronger, so it won't break when you pull it. If your hair is too stubborn, then you may need to coat your brush in lubricating oil or olive oil to ease the detangling process., If you are growing out your hair, you might need to experiment with different methods of detangling. If you have shorter hair, you might be able to use dry-detangling. If you have longer hair, you might need to condition while detangling. As your hair changes, check to see if you need to change your detangling method from dry to wet.  

consider detangling your hair with water and conditioner.  consider detangling your hair while it's dry.  try different methods for transitioning hair.

 Lay the ladder on the ground with both of its feet against the wall. Lift the top of the ladder and walk towards the wall, raising it one rung at a time., The simplest way to achieve this is by standing with your toes touching the feet of the ladder and extending your arms forward. Your palms should be able to reach a rung of the ladder when your arms are fully extended. If the angle is too steep, the ladder could tip backward; too shallow and it could slide out or bend in the middle.         You can also achieve this angle by pulling the feet of the ladder away from the wall about ¼ of the total length of the ladder.  Always place feet parallel to the wall and on firm, level ground. It is never safe to place your ladder on top of any objects to gain additional height.On soft ground, flip the ladder feet up to expose the spurs and stomp on the bottom rung to penetrate the ground. On uneven ground, a ladder leveler is the only safe way to effectively extend one leg of the ladder.If possible, you can also bolt a cleat into the ground behind the feet to aid against slipping.  Both side rails should be equally supported and placed on an even surface. The ladder should not slide or wobble when you put weight against it. Whenever practical, tie off the top of the ladder to further secure it to the wall., You should always climb one rung at a time, moving only one hand or one foot at a time. Always face the ladder as you climb, and only use the rungs to climb opposed to the side rails.  There are a variety of tasks that call for a ladder, and a variety of accessories for the top of ladders that can help you more easily and safely complete those tasks.Soft "mitts" that slip over the top of the side rails can provide extra grip and protect the surface from damage done by the ladder. Ladder stabilizers basically widen the points at which the top of the ladder rests. This can be useful to protect fragile siding or to clear the width of a window. Single support attachments are necessary whenever the ladder is leaned against a surface narrower than the width of the ladder, like a telephone pole. They mount to the ladder above the top rung between the two side rails.  Aluminium ladders tend to be the lightest weight, but they are also electrical conductors. So whenever you need to place your ladder near a live electrical line or fixture, or even when working with corded power tools, it is best to use a wooden or fiberglass ladder, as neither are electrical conductors., Checking all the moving parts, like feet and rung locks, as well as the overall integrity of the ladder, can prevent the worst of accidents. It’s also important that the ladder is clean of any foreign substances that could be slippery, sticky, corrosive, conductive, or otherwise an added hazard to using the ladder.  All ladders are sold with a label on the outside of one of the side rails that details the ladders max length, duty (or max weight), and other helpful safety information. Remember that max weight includes the weight of your body, clothes, tools, and any accessories attached to the ladder.  

raise the ladder.  set the ladder at a 75° angle with the ground.  make sure the feet are secure.  make sure the top of the ladder is secure.  climb the ladder maintaining three points of contact.  utilize accessories to help stabilize the top of the ladder.  avoid aluminium ladders when working with electricity.  inspect your ladder for damage often.  refer to your ladder’s safety label. 

 You will need a pack of white rice - ideally you would use one that is almost or at its expiration date, but otherwise you can just purchase the cheapest pack of rice you can find.

You can use shallow cardboard boxes, shoe boxes or empty baking trays.; , Put a couple of drops of food coloring in a small bowl then add ½ a teaspoon of vinegar. Add the food coloring and vinegar to the rice, then add a couple of drops of the essential oil of your choice.   Alternatively, you could color the rice using Colorations Liquid Watercolors.

Then remove the lid and pour the rice onto an empty baking tray and leave in the open to dry for a day. Proceed to coloring your next batch of rice.  You will need a pack of white rice - ideally you would use one that is almost or at its expiration date, but otherwise you can just purchase the cheapest one you can find. You will need one cup of rice per color.   Rubbing alcohol or hand sanitizer – ½ a teaspoon for every cup of rice. So if you want to make five colors then that’s 2.5 tablespoons of rubbing alcohol or hand sanitizer. Variety of food colors – red, green, blue, yellow and orange Reusable plastic containers – empty ice cream tubs or empty cookie containers with lids from the grocery store will do. An empty, flat space in your house where you can spread the rice out for drying. You can use shallow cardboard boxes, shoe boxes or empty baking trays.  Put a couple of drops of food coloring in a small bowl then add ½ a teaspoon of rubbing alcohol. Pour the contents of the bowl onto the rice in the container. Since you’re using rubbing alcohol, there’s no need to use any essential oils.   Some parents shy away from using rubbing alcohol because kids may accidentally place the rice in their mouth. Rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizers technically make the rice inedible as opposed to using vinegar.  Then remove the lid and pour the rice onto an empty baking tray and leave in the open to dry for a day. Proceed to coloring your next batch of rice.  Colored rice that's been made with rubbing alcohol usually lasts for 6 to 7 months, provided it's been stored in a sealed container without moisture seeping in. Colored rice made with vinegar usually lasts up to 4 months.  You can scoop a handful of each of the different colors of rice into separate clear plastic bottles with screw caps on. Kids can then shake these bottles to stimulate their hearing as well as coordination of their hands and arm muscles.  You can pour a few scoops of each color of rice into a box or bin and add different kinds of materials, from miniature toys, to felt shapes, to colored balls and fabric pompoms that you can find at most craft stores.   The idea is to bombard your child’s sense of sight and touch with colors, shapes and textures, with the colored rice serving as a backdrop.  Place each color of rice in a separate container and give your child a shovel or a small scoop and her own container. Ask her to pour the colored rice from the main containers into her own, where she can mix the colors as she likes  , Place the different colored rice in small ziplock bags and label each bag with their corresponding color. This will teach the child about colors and at the same time, stimulate her sense of touch.  For older kids, use the colored sensory rice as the backdrop for a little craft project. You can pour the colored rice into a shoebox and add some miniature things to make it look like a small beach or a small underwater “aquarium” with miniature plastic fish and corals.  Listed below are some tried and tested containers for storing the colored rice:   A shallow container with lid Cardboard box Large plastic salad bowl Foil roasting pan  , Storing rice in a container with a lid is preferable and recommended as it will prevent moisture in the air from spoiling the texture and color of the rice. By using the lid you can store the colored rice for a longer time as compared to storing without a lid.  You don’t have to worry about coloring the rice over and over again, as colored rice will stay for as long as you need it. The color might fade a bit over time but it won't disappear completely.  

gather your supplies.  pour a cup of rice into a container with lid.  put the lid on the container and shake vigorously.  gather your supplies.  pour a cup of rice into a container with lid.  put the lid back on and shake vigorously.  know that there is a time limit for rice mixed with rubbing alcohol.  create colorful shakers out of the rice.  stimulate your child’s senses by mixing the rice with other toys.  have your child play with a shovel and the rice.  use labels to teach your child about colors.  use the rice for an arts and crafts project.  consider what kind of container you would like to use.  look for a lid.  be aware that the color of the rice might fade over time. 

 The more you see him, the more your social interactions will escalate. The key is to make things feel like they happened organically.   The first time you see each other you will have an immediate physical attraction. The second time you see each other, you might smile at one another if the attraction is mutual. The third time you may finally start a conversation.Humans enjoy familiarity so the more you create a sense of familiarity, the more you create a sense of attraction.  Location plays a role in developing an attraction because it can indicate shared interests. For example, if you are constantly seeing each other at the gym, it signals that you both keep fitness as a priority., Be careful not to overdo your interactions. It will quickly become obvious if you are going out of your way to see him. It also allows you to build intrigue and desire if you leave him wanting more after each interaction.  In the initial stages of interaction, it’s often difficult to know his schedule. Get on his radar once you know a little about his interests and schedule. Invite him to join you or inquire when he will be at a location next rather than relying on fait.You can also ask mutual acquaintances or drop hints as to where you will be to see if he picks up and joins you.  Men enjoy the thrill of the chase. If you make it obvious that you will do anything to see him and hang on his every movement, you will be less attractive than if you present yourself as independent and mysterious. Feign surprise when you run into him, even if you had it planned. 

create as many interactions as you can.  strategize where you want to run into him.  don’t stalk him.  don’t rely on seeing him again as schedules can often factor in.  run into him accidentally. 

 It's important to plan ahead so that you know what you are doing. And you don't have to make a pig, instead you could make a puppy bank! Be creative, although a piggy bank is certainly fine to make. Think about your interests or pets, such as cats or football. Anything that is fairly round or has a body can work. If you are stuck without ideas, here are some to name a few:   Any animal: usually very simple structures, and cute, too! If you like animals, this is the way to go. Some more specific ideas for an animal are dogs, cats, turtles, elephants, horses, and rabbits.  Sports: Make a ball if you're a sports lover! You can make a football, soccer ball, basketball, or bowling ball (with three round holes instead of one little slit).  Food: A very creative idea, but can be tricky! If you want to make a food, try a hamburger, cupcake, apple, or even a stack of pancakes!; , Make sure that it is very round, or else it won't be a piggy bank! If, however, you are making a bank where the body isn't completely round, such as a football, shape the clay more into that shape. But with animals, you can add details like the head and tail later, this is just the body or base of the bank where the money will be held., Make sure that the halves are even, so try as best as you can to cut through the center. They should also be clean (without any tears). Now you will have two half-circles., Take one clay piece and press your thumb through the center, but not all the way. Start to knead with your fingers outward, pushing the clay in the center to make a dent, like a bowl. Make sure that it is somewhat deep, but check the edges. They shouldn't be too thick, no thicker than 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm), but no thinner than 1/4 an inch at the bottom. Do this with both halves.  Take the scoring tool and quickly flick it across the width of the edges of the bowl. Do this to both of the bowls. Make sure you go all the way around the bowls. You score clay so that the two bowls will soon connect and stick together., You may have to apply the water more than once. The, press the two halves together and apply more water on the crack where the bowls come together. You can also use your fingers the same way. After applying the water or smoothing the clay with your fingers, you shouldn't be able to see the crack. Now you have one piece of clay again., At the top of the piggy bank, stick the knife in until it goes all the way through. Work around that, cutting a rectangle shape. This is the coin slot. Don't make this slot too big, no wider than a centimeter.  Also make a slot for the bottom of the bank. Do the same thing you did for the top coin slot, but make this one a circle. Make sure that it is big enough for a quarter to come out, but don't make it too big or else all of the coins will quickly come through.  This is the fun part! If you are making an animal, roll extra pieces of clay for the head and stick them on the body of the bank by scoring, adding water and smoothing it with your fingers. Add a tail for certain animals.   Legs: for legs, make oval shapes and gently flatten them on a surface. You can then add them to your animal. This works great with elephants and turtles! But, make sure that the legs are thick enough to support the rest of the body.        Face: to add a face, use the clay knife to poke eyes and a mouth for your animal. You can use the clay knife for other details, too, like writing in letters, numbers, or anything that would add to your bank.  Put the bank in an oven for a few minutes. The temperature should be 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit)., Be creative! Paint over your bank the way you like it. You can add polka dots to your pig, or purple frosting to your cupcake. But, it is good to paint over your bank at least twice so the colors stay on. Let the glaze dry for an hour or two.  Put the clay in the oven again (optional) on 93 degrees Celsius (200 degrees Fahrenheit) for 10 minutes. Enjoy your piggy bank!  

decide on what you would like to make.  take a large piece of clay and roll it.  when it is round, take the clay knife and cut the clay right through the middle.  make two bowls.  score the clay.  dip your finger in the water just a bit and apply it to both of the the bowls you scored.  cut slots with the clay knife.  add details to the body of the bank.  cook the clay.  paint the clay with glaze. 

 The right socks will help you put on cowboy boots. Wear boot socks or ribbed athletic ones that go up to your calf. The sock material will help you wiggle your feet into boots along with your body weight., It will be easier to push your heels into cowboy boots if you’re sitting down. Use the side of your bed to sit down on as long as your feet fully touch the ground.  Many cowboy boots have pull straps located on the sides and top of each. Insert your index fingers from the front with the tips facing backwards. Open the tops wide as you hold onto the straps. If you don’t have loops on the sides of your boots, grasp the sides with your hands., Pull the boots up by pulling on the straps. They may go on all the way, or they may stop before your ankle is flush with the heel., While keeping your fingers in the loops, use your body weight to step down as you pull one boot up. Your foot should slide into place. 

wear boot socks.  sit down on a chair or bench.  use the boot pull straps.  place your foot in the upper portion of the boot.  stand up and put the boot heel on the floor.
